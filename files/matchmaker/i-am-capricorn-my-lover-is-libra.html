			<p>This is not a classic astrological combination (your Sun signs are in a challenging aspect to one another), but because you share some interests, you might be able to make this work if you try. You two may have other planets in your charts that relate well to one another.</p>
<p>Both of you like a busy social calendar and both of you have plenty of energy, although your Libra will want to go out more than you do. Libras know just about everyone on earth and will introduce you to some amazing people. As a Capricorn, you are always looking to widen your circle of friends and contacts, so you will enjoy this quality. Your Libra lover is the essence of diplomacy and charm, an asset to you when he or she tags along with you to business functions.</p>
<p>Capricorn and Libra are <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/three-qualities/cardinal/">cardinal</a> signs, so you both are pioneers and like change. <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-planets/venus/">Venus</a>-ruled Libras show their strength subtly. By use of their substantial charm, Libras have been known to be the power behind the throne.</p>
<p>If you experience difficulties, it will come when your Libra complains that you are away at the office too much. You may respond to your Libra that you are contributing to his or her lifestyle by earning a good living, and he or she should be more understanding. Libras are so good at networking that your sweetie might show you how to get ahead without so much sweat. Libras know how to use their charisma in any situation! Still, you might begin to wish for a more self-sufficient partner and ask yourself, &#8220;Why does he (or she) always need me there?&#8221; But Libra is the sign of partnership and marriage, and they feel incomplete without a mate to interact with on a regular basis. But since they like being married, your Libra would not leave you unless the relationship took a radical nosedive.</p>
<p>Another problem is that Libras are not as practical or grounded as you. You&#8217;re focused, ambitious and determined. Your Libra partner may seem scattered and may not share your need for a strong, stable base. You may feel that he or she refuses to apply his or her ample talents. In time, when life inevitably adds more responsibility to your shoulders, this could frustrate or even anger you when you find you are carrying too much of the load.</p>
<p>Sexually, you are very much in touch with your body. While Libras are more intellectual than physical, you can bring your lover to your level of enjoyment. Good sex won&#8217;t be a problem! Libras are known for keeping their good looks up far into old age, so you need not worry that your lover&#8217;s appearance will decline as time goes by. And even after you&#8217;re long wed, your Venus-ruled lover will continue to flirt with you and keep the fire of your heart burning bright.</p>
<p>This match gets a 50-50 chance of success, mainly because the Sun signs are at an obstacle angle to one another. The answer is to go slowly and get to know your sweetheart well. If after time, you decide your Libra is the one for you, proceed! You may have the right planets in your individual charts to outweigh these drawbacks!</p>
