<h1>i-am-virgo-my-lover-is-sagittarius<h1>

			<p>You are both independent, so getting either of you to commit to a long-term relationship is going to be tough. As soon as one of you thinks it could be possible, the other is likely to get the jitters. Virgo, half the time you figure you&#8217;d rather live alone. Freedom-loving Sagittarius, you&#8217;ve met your match! They don&#8217;t call Sagittarius the bachelor sign (male or female, same difference) for nothing! Of course, there are Sagittarius and Virgos who do team up beautifully, so be patient and go slowly. You could make this work if you want to!</p>
<p>There are up sides to this union, but down sides, too. Both of you are <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/three-qualities/mutable/">mutable</a> signs, which means you both are adaptable, flexible, and keep an open mind. You will enjoy Sagittarius&#8217; eternal optimism, and their ability to take risks. Your nature is one far more cautious and steady, and you&#8217;re less likely to act on impulse. This combination can be good for both of you: Sagittarius could get you to act a little more quickly and confidently, while you could get Sagittarius to think rationally before flinging himself or herself into some risky new endeavor. Being an <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/earth/">earth</a> sign, you rankle at exaggerations and generalities. You will urge your lover to think things through with focus and detail; your solid sense of practicality is alluring to Sagittarius.</p>
<p>Virgos are very polite and diplomatic, but Sagittarius&#8217; straight-talking style can be hurtful. Sagittarius keep running into problems because they&#8217;re too direct with people. After a while you may get used to this, as it is innate with Sagittarius and you know they mean no offense. When it comes to spending money, you could see a real difference between you, too. Virgos like to conserve, but Sagittarius are so optimistic they see Virgos&#8217; need to squirrel money away as just plain stingy.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re different when it comes to work, too. Your Sagittarius may announce flatly one day that he or she can&#8217;t stand his or her job and has quit &#8212; without having another job waiting in the wings. In fact, he or she may announce the need to go away on a trip to think it all through (Sagittarius loves travel). &#8220;Quit your job AND spend money on a trip?&#8221; I can hear you say in disbelief, adding, &#8220;Are you insane?&#8221; Such blind faith that things will work out is not part of Virgo&#8217;s temperament and will tend to make you nervous.</p>
<p>Virgos are worriers, and Sagittarius are the just the opposite; they worry about almost nothing. Since your lover is ruled by <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-planets/jupiter/">Jupiter</a>, his or her footloose style usually works &#8212; as amazing as that sounds. By demanding so much, Sagittarius usually get what they want. Sagittarius, a <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/fire/">fire</a> sign, wants passion and excitement to dominate his or her life &#8212; and it does. Whatever form that passion takes &#8212; a fantastic career, a beautiful city to live in, or the love of their lives &#8212; Sagittarius expect to find exactly what they seek. You need to believe in your Sagittarius and know that although this route to happiness is different from yours, it will nevertheless work out.</p>
<p>Both of your signs are considered intellectual, so you can be sure your conversations will always be fun and lively. You communicate about everything under the Sun in a precise, penetrating way with one another. Sagittarius like to go back to school for advanced degrees, and if your lover tells you he or she is sending in applications, you are likely to be very supportive of these goals.</p>
<p>When two signs&#8217; Suns are at ninety-degree angles to one another, as is the case with you and Sagittarius, it is considered a tense configuration. Called a square aspect, it means that challenges will always be present. Yet a square aspect suggests plenty of action and energy, so you both will be actively involved with trying to make the union work. Neither of you would sit back and just let things roll. This is a good thing. Your Sun falls in your Sagittarius&#8217; house of career fame. Sagittarius&#8217; Sun falls in your house of home and family, so each of you helps the other in different areas. You will be actively supportive of your lover&#8217;s career, and in turn he or she will help you build the home life you want.</p>
<p>In lovemaking, you have different styles, which will show up right away. Your Sagittarius is enthusiastic, passionate, lusty and quick to get worked up. You are more reserved and slow to succumb at first, remaining coolly detached until you are sure. Then your Sagittarius will discover that once you are sure of his or her love &#8212; truly sure &#8212; you can let go as only an earth sign can, and cause the earth to move underneath the two of you. Neither one of you likes anything phony in love, and the game playing of romance doesn&#8217;t fascinate either of you. If you find love with your Sagittarius, you will find a safe haven in his or her arms. Your loving, sexual energy can help smooth over your personality differences and make you forgive and forget the small stuff.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t going to be the easiest of unions, but it can work if you take care. Virgo, don&#8217;t be too critical of your lover. Let him or her inspire you with sports, games and travel. Sagittarius will lighten up your outlook. In turn, you will give your Sagittarius a solid sense of the practical side of any issue. This pairing can work if you want it badly.</p>
