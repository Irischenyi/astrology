			<p>This sparkling, zany paring could not get any better. Both of you are intellectual <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/air/">air</a> signs, so conversation, good books, travel, jokes, parties, a rich social life, and a host of other activities are sure to spice up your time together. Ask an Aquarius why he or she married a Gemini and the answer is quick and easy: &#8216;For fun!&#8217; Good answer. One wise psychologist said more couples should forget all reasons to get married except one: In the end, is your time together fun? This psychologist would approve of you and your Gemini!</p>
<p>Communication between you two is so superb that it knocks you out, and you both often need to scoot out of town together to chill out. Both of you have quick minds and are fast-paced thinkers &#8212; others sometimes have trouble keeping up with you! You have many friends that you enjoy introducing to your sweetheart, and thus, your circle of friends and acquaintances will widen considerably with this union. But you&#8217;ll be best friends, too.</p>
<p>In bed, you&#8217;ll adore the playful, inventive qualities of Gemini; their penchant for talking dirty in your most intimate moments will drive you wild. An open relationship might appeal to you, but be careful &#8212; one of you could get hurt, much to the surprise of both. Gemini is up-to-the-minute on trends, but too liberal a sexual situation is probably not a good idea for either of you. Neither of you is deeply sentimental (unless a <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/water/">water</a> sign is placed strikingly in one your charts), so you don&#8217;t need nights of moonlight and roses to get in the mood. But remember to schedule a few enchanted evenings anyway, just for the thrill of it!</p>
<p>Your relationship has the promise of a four-star, solid gold union, so hold on to one another. The trust you share, your mutual respect, and your enjoyment of being together can stand the test of time.</p>
