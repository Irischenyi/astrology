			<p class="text">This is not a classic match, for Gemini need more excitement and stimuli on a regular basis than you do. It was, no doubt, your Gemini&#8217;s quick mind and resourcefulness that drew you to him or her in the first place. This partner can loosen you up and you may like that, for Capricorns can get mighty serious!</p>
<p>Gemini are not possessive. They keep themselves busy, so they won&#8217;t complain when you stay late at the office. However, their need to keep discovering new aspects of your personality could make you feel worried that once they know all about you, they&#8217;ll get bored and move on. You could be right. Changing and growing as a person will be vital, but ultimately worthwhile, for your lover will always introduce you to everything that is new to the world. Gemini is nothing if not current, and they stay up-to-date on a wide variety of subjects. You will have very stimulating discussions throughout your life with your Gemini! Gemini are little fireballs of enthusiastic energy and they work hard &#8212; something you admire in a partner.</p>
<p>In bed, Gemini are whimsical, inventive, and experimental &#8212; exceptional partners in many ways. They will never expect more from you than they can deliver themselves, but since they are so talented at lovemaking, you might feel under pressure to think up new things. Gemini need variety, so if you don&#8217;t want to be replaced, be resourceful! For example, you could seduce your lover in just about every room of the house, and then move on to other locations. Send your Gemini love notes. Surprise is the key to the Gemini heart and libido.</p>
<p>In short, this relationship has a chance to survive, but it will take a Herculean effort from you. Decide if it&#8217;s worth it.</p>
