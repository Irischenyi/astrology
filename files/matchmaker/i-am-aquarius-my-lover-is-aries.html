You&#8217;re an <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/air/">air</a> sign and Aries is <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/fire/">fire</a>, so the pairing of your two signs produces terrific energy. Both of you value honesty and open communication, something that will keep your relationship going over the long haul.</p>
<p class="text">In bed, your Aries is confident, inventive, and not intensely emotional (and neither are you). Nor is either of you possessive or prone to jealousy.
