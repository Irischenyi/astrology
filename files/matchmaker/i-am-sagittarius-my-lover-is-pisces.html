			<p class="text">Pisces with Sagittarius is not an easy or natural pairing. Still, both of you are <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/three-qualities/mutable/">mutable</a> signs, which means you are highly flexible people and have the ability to work things out. Let&#8217;s look at what could pop up and spoil your relationship so that you can take steps to smooth things out when (or if) they occur.</p>
<p>Your most obvious difference is that Pisces are sentimental romantics who wear their hearts on their sleeves. Their large and expressive eyes mirror their feelings, and even if a Pisces wanted to hide something, he or she would not be able to. You, Sagittarius, could not be more different, and at times, you will feel that your Pisces is overly sensitive. Your Pisces lover will not respond well to your brutal honesty. Pisces wouldn&#8217;t dream of being as direct with you &#8212; or anyone else &#8212; and they are careful to surround their negative comments with positive ones to soften them. You feel that this is too much work. Pisces might respond by saying you ought to be more caring. One rule: It&#8217;s absolutely critical to take your Pisces&#8217; feelings seriously. Sagittarius can too often make the mistake of dismissing them.</p>
<p>On the plus side, Pisces will adore your mind, especially your ability to think in broad, conceptual terms. Your lover will also appreciate that you are courageous enough to tackle the big questions in life, for this is also an integral part of being a Pisces. Sagittarius rules the <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-12-sectors/ninth-house/">9th house</a> of the horoscope, which rules spiritual questions. Pisces are intensely spiritual, too. Both of you care very much about others; Pisces care for individuals and you care about groups of people and society as a whole.</p>
<p>Pisces will not conflict with Sagittarius&#8217; need for space. Since Pisces live in the worlds they create out of their dreams, fantasies, and imaginative projects, they will not crowd you. They stay busy by themselves. You will be thrilled by the breadth and scope of your lover&#8217;s imagination and his or her poetic view of life. Your lover lacks your strong self-esteem, but you might help your Pisces realize his or her full potential by building up his or her confidence. Pisces is not into self-awareness in the way an Aries would be, so Pisces aren&#8217;t sure of the value of their own ideas and work. (This does get better as they get older.) Pisces are enormously self-sacrificing. This can make you wonder how your lover does it, but still, you do admire this quality in him or her.</p>
<p>When you make love to a Pisces, you will become transported to another world. Pisces expect &#8212; and usually achieve &#8212; an ethereal, transforming experience each time. To Pisces, sex is the most precious and powerful expression between two people in love &#8212; they don&#8217;t take the experience lightly. Nor should you, if you want to make this union last. You, Sagittarius, have different expectations from sex. But while you are less deep and dramatic in your approach, your intellect will permit you to absorb Pisces&#8217; mood if you want to.</p>
<p>Will this union work? <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/fire/">Fire </a>sign Sagittarius is not a classical pairing with <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/water/">water</a> sign Pisces. But if you love a Pisces, you can absolutely make it work, so reel this Fish in!</p>
