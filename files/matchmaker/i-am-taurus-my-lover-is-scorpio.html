<h1>i-am-taurus-my-lover-is-scorpio<h1>

			<p>What a potent combination! You both have strong wills, opinions, determination and drive. Neither of you feels casual about anything! When you first met your Scorpio beloved you may have felt this person was more fascinating than anyone you&#8217;d ever met. Perhaps you noticed that he or she had qualities you wish you had, too. You are on the money, for you and Scorpio are born at opposite ends of the zodiac, and have some extreme differences &#8212; and quite a few similarities, too.</p>
<p>Your autumn-born lover is mysterious and deeply emotional, far more so than you. A <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/water/">water</a> sign, Scorpios blend well with your <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/earth/">earth</a> element, but Scorpios will be far more interested in learning about you than letting you peek inside their heads and hearts. Scorpios feel that to share this information is like giving pieces of themselves away. Before they do that, they have to feel safe. Scorpios always hold their cards close to their vests. Even after you&#8217;ve known your Scorpio for years, you will find that he or she periodically withdraws to mull things over.</p>
<p>Scorpio rules the hidden realms under the surface of life, so they have the ability to get to the very bottom of things and discover what secrets lay buried. You may not see it, but Scorpios are almost always bubbling with emotion under the their placid exteriors. This sign also rules obsession. Try as they will to control their feelings (keeping emotion in check is crucial to Scorpios), they won&#8217;t fully be able to do so. Your steady, calm demeanor will give solid grounding to them as they weather their fluctuating emotions, and this is certainly a big part of your attraction. However, because Scorpios don&#8217;t like to discuss their feelings freely, and Taurus are not given to examining feelings frequently, powerful resentments could build up and be swept under the rug. Be mindful of that danger, and try to keep the air clear.</p>
<p>Scorpios are intuitive: They pick up hunches about things that turn out to be dead right nine times out of ten, but they often have no idea why they know what they know. Don&#8217;t demand a practical or logical explanation &#8212; you won&#8217;t be able to get one. They are indeed blessed with some psychic ability.</p>
<p>Both of you are <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/three-qualities/fixed/">fixed</a> signs, with heaps of determination and single-minded focus. Neither of you will become distracted from the goals you&#8217;ve set. This also means that neither of you is very flexible or good at compromising, which can lead to dead-lock. This kind of stand-off interrupts the flow between you, so be mindful of conflicts and ask yourself if there is a way to compromise.</p>
<p>When it comes to handling finances, Scorpios really excel. Their sign rules the natural <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-12-sectors/eighth-house/">8th house</a> of joint resources. Your sign rules another financial house, the <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-12-sectors/second-house/">2nd house</a> of personal wealth. Thus, you both are security-oriented, although Taurus are more into buying things while Scorpios are more interested in making investments. Your lover also won&#8217;t want to spend a lot of money on expensive dinners and other luxuries &#8211; Scorpios&#8217; tastes are less complex and more straightforward.</p>
<p>When it comes to negotiations, Scorpios know their stuff. They are masters of persuasion because they don&#8217;t spend time addressing points that don&#8217;t matter to the other side; instead, they go straight to the heart of the matter. This includes negotiating with you, on matters big or small, but don&#8217;t be intimidated. Your Scorpio will make so much sense that he or she will earn your respect. Soon, you will find yourself asking his or her advice on how you can best handle the negotiations in your own life.</p>
<p>Both of you are reserved and not especially outgoing. Neither of you likes the dating scene and having to continually tell your life story to strangers. You are both highly possessive lovers too, but you won&#8217;t find it causes conflicts. Scorpios expect total and complete fidelity and so do you. When you mate, you know it will be for life.</p>
<p>Taurus, in bed you are a powerhouse of energy and sexual mastery. Your Scorpio will expect an incredible depth of feeling from you, something you may or may not be able to give. Because they are a <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/water/">water</a> sign, Scorpios will always have a deeper, wider emotional spectrum than you. Scorpios bring love to a level of spirituality, something a feet-on-the-ground Taurus may have trouble relating to initially. You may have to dismantle some of your practical sensibilities and develop a more romantic frame of mind. Still, your Scorpio will be enraptured by your erotic style, and during long hours lolling in bed will enjoy your careful attention to their every need. Your obvious desire and honest affection for your beloved will thrill them down to their toes (Scorpios always sense truth), and this will create a lasting bond. You will never know such passion. It could be the start of a powerful nuclear reaction of love, the kind you always hoped for!</p>
<p>Your Scorpio will either be the best thing that ever happened to you, or the worst. Whether you complement or compete with one another is yet to be seen. Opposite signs on the astrologic wheel have that potential. If you develop some flexibility and sharpen your emotional sensitivity, things should go very well. This is not easy and some have said linking a Taurus with a Scorpio can be hard if not impossible. Give this relationship all you&#8217;ve got &#8212; the rewards are too good to miss.</p>
