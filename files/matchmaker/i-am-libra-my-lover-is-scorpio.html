<h1>i-am-libra-my-lover-is-scorpio<h1>

			<p>This is an interesting match. Libras are all light, polished, refined elegance, and Scorpios are all mysterious, dark, sensual sexuality. If you want to keep your lover interested, don&#8217;t reveal all; your Scorpio needs the challenge and the lure of the chase. Signs that are found side by side in the zodiac are opposites &#8212; the sign that follows makes up for what the first sign lacks. So your sign has plenty of brains and objectivity, but doesn&#8217;t reach high on the lusty, emotional scale. Scorpio makes up for this.</p>
<p>You might say this is a good thing, and, indeed, it might be. However, you might find your lover longs for you to reach his or her emotional intensity, which could be hard. Few signs can match the emotional spectrum of a Scorpio! Libras are talkers, but Scorpios are more taciturn. When Scorpios fall into moods, they sometimes brood. Here&#8217;s where you can help, by using your diplomatic Libra flair to gently open your lover up. Be careful, however. Scorpios can lash out, shouting, &#8220;I want to be alone!&#8221; Isolation is something social Libra almost never craves and finds hard to understand. Not having your lover around to talk to could kill the relationship for you all by itself.</p>
<p>You need to be popular and have lots of friends, but Scorpio could care less. You love to go out, but Scorpio wants to lock the door and pull down the blinds. Troubles, troubles.</p>
<p>Sex is extremely important to your lover. Scorpios cannot imagine a long-term relationship without lots of it, and (lucky you) they have the bedroom skills to make lovemaking a memorable, lusty, sensual experience. Your lover wants sex to be near karmic in emotional intensity, although as a rational <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/air/">air sign</a>, you may find yourself scrambling to keep up. Libras tend to want marriage and commitment, and Scorpios, being highly possessive, don&#8217;t want to share their lovers with anyone else. You have different views, but have the same goal.</p>
<p>Give this relationship a chance. This could be your dream lover and best friend, or the relationship may fizzle because it had great chemistry but no rapport. There will be no in-between, and you will know soon.</p>
