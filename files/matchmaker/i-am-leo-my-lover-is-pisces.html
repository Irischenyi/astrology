			<p>The roaring Lion and the gentle Fish &#8212; sounds like an unlikely pairing. But in an odd way, this relationship works many times, even though astrologically it is not a classic pairing. You are a <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/fire/">fire</a> sign and Pisces is <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/water/">water</a>, two elements that don&#8217;t blend easily.</p>
<p>Your Pisces lover is sentimental, emotional, and deeply romantic. Here you find your bond, for Leo loves to be in love. Your Pisces will fulfill your every fantasy, from the little notes, to the gifts, the moonlight walks, and the poetry read to one another out loud. Pisces need the kisses, the touching, the glances across crowded rooms &#8212; even more than you do. They will adore your outgoing ways, your warm-hearted generosity, and your penchant for parties. You will have to get used to their periodic need for seclusion, for the world wears out Pisces. They are delicate sponges for the feelings of others and need time alone to cleanse themselves of the world&#8217;s cares.</p>
<p>You may wonder why Pisces respond so quickly to people&#8217;s pleas for help if it so depletes them, but Pisces rules the feet, so they walk easily in the shoes of others. When they rest, the well of sympathy they have inside refills, and they are ready to go out again and help. When others feel pain, they feel it too, in equal measure. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it is a stranger or a friend &#8212; they will react with the same compassion. You may find them impressionable or unfocused, but they really aren&#8217;t. What you sense is their capacity for unconditional giving, something rare and wonderful.</p>
<p>Pisces are not into material things, although if you give your lover a sparkling diamond or amethyst he or she will treasure it as a token of your love. If you cannot afford to give your Pisces a jewel, just tell him or her that you wish you could and it will be enough. (&#8220;See the bracelet of diamonds my lover gave me?&#8221; swooned one thrilled Pisces, showing me a completely naked wrist. She knew it was as if it were there, after her lover told her he was depressed because he had no money to buy her one. The thought was enough for her.)</p>
<p>Pisces see the world in gestures and symbols. They always know what you are thinking, because they watch actions and how things are said instead of listening to what is being said. They may, at times, disapprove of your wild spending, but all in all they will respect your decisions. They may ask you to make a contribution now and then to a charity to remind you of how fortunate you are. Pisces sees the world as essentially temporary and fleeting (they&#8217;re right), and their eyes are focused on a dimension, which is not tied to time or place. To Pisces, this world is simply an illusion.</p>
<p>In bed, you will experience the capacity of Pisces to give and receive love. Your lover will spin a magic web (this is the sign of &#8220;make believe&#8221;) and bring you into a fantasy world. Clasped in each other&#8217;s arms you will spin above the earth, not mindful of time or space. Your lover&#8217;s rich imagination will thrill you, as will his or her never-ending adoration of you. In love, your Pisces demands you reach a spiritual depth you never have before. Oddly, you may find yourself there despite your tendency not to dive to such depths in the sea of love.</p>
<p>Pisces of either sex will submit to your willingness to rule the relationship if that makes you happy (it does), because to them, power isn&#8217;t worth the trouble. To Pisces, self-sacrifice is the highest compliment, for they are the last sign of the zodiac and therefore a compendium of all the signs that have come before. They are highly evolved. By <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-planets/neptune/">Neptune&#8217;s</a> rulership of Pisces, this sign rules universal love &#8212; a kind of unconditional love that you probably have never before encountered. Pisces&#8217; way of persuasion is not domineering, but rather soft and subtle. Pisces is a <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/three-qualities/mutable/">mutable</a> sign, and therefore flexible, and is more likely to be the one compromising when a disagreement surfaces.</p>
<p>Leo, don&#8217;t take advantage of Pisces&#8217; good nature. It is easy to do, without even noticing. Leo can at times be arrogant, dictatorial and possessive, too. Pisces need time to sort out their feelings; being a deeply emotional sign, they aren&#8217;t always sure how they feel until they think about it a bit. Pisces will not put up too hard a fight or sustain long arguments. Push them too hard, and they will swim away. Disharmony bruises them and they will have no choice but to leave. Like the magic and miracles they believe in, they are also capable of disappearing into thin air, and by then it will be too late to fix your relationship. Treasure your Pisces, and your love will glow like a jewel between you for years and years. Yes, you can prove that water and fire can co-exist.</p>
