			<p class="text">Signs that are next to one another in the zodiac are very different from one another, making up for what the previous one lacks. So be aware, your Pisces lover isn&#8217;t anything like you, yet this could be the major reason you&#8217;re attracted to him or her. How you fare is going to depend on you.</p>
<p>Pisces&#8217; capability for close relationships and their compassion with those around them may have led you to them. You both are sensitive to suffering, but you express it differently. Pisces will help others on a one-on-one basis, because they are more private people. You, on the other hand, might not spend the afternoon grocery shopping for an elderly neighbor, but you&#8217;ll set up an organization to help all the elderly folks in town. You both have different approaches, but sensitivity is your common denominator.</p>
<p>You are likely to encounter turbulence with Pisces over your different levels of emotional intensity. Pisces gives all to the relationship, so if you get involved with your work and you don&#8217;t call when you say you will, or you seem preoccupied, your Pisces will be upset.</p>
<p>Sex is important to Pisces too, but they want it to be a mystical experience &#8212; a meeting of two souls. You may or may not be up to this expression, for your approach is more affectionate and recreational than spiritual. Equally important to Pisces are your expressions of praise, attention, reassurance, and general pride in him or her before you ever get them into bed. In case you think you can get away with faking your feelings, think again &#8212; Pisces is a master of reading body language. If you aren&#8217;t willing to give your partner what they crave, Pisces won&#8217;t be in this relationship long. Pisces feel everyone has the right to ardent passion from their lover, not just once in a while but every time. This can be fantastic or dreadful news, depending on your personality. Be aware: They&#8217;re not kidding.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s say you are more than willing to work with your partner to give them what they want most. You will have a loyal, caring partner who will encourage you every step of the way. You will be amazed how your Pisces seems to read what you&#8217;re thinking &#8212; many are downright psychic. Individuals who are lucky enough to have a Pisces behind them often scale heights of fame and fortune. Once a Pisces believes in you, there isn&#8217;t anything he or she wouldn&#8217;t do or sacrifice on your behalf.</p>
<p>If they are taken advantage of, Pisces will continue to stay, and give, for a while. Then suddenly, the Fish&#8217;s self-preservation impulse kicks in, and at that point the Fish swims away, without warning, never to return. This sudden change is often the biggest shock for Aquarius. Although they generally expect the unexpected from life, there are no warning signals at all from a betrayed Pisces. Pisces does not like confrontation. Rather than fight, they leave. Be aware of this tendency and put your considerable skills of communication to good use before this happens.</p>
<p>Remember to be kind, gentle, and above all warm to your Pisces. The natural Aquarius coolness can be hurtful. This match is a draw &#8212; win or lose, it&#8217;s up to you!</p>
