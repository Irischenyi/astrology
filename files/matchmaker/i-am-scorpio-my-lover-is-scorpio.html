<h1>i-am-scorpio-my-lover-is-scorpio<h1>

			<p>Wow! In some of the astrology textbooks, a Scorpio in love with a Scorpio is a pretty potent brew! Do the two of you ever get out of bed? Talk about a nuclear reaction! This relationship is a firecracker, and all of it is powerfully good. You both are physical, emotional and expressive. Your feelings run very strong and deep. Together you build a circle of love around you that the outside world simply cannot penetrate.</p>
<p>The trouble here is that both of you can get a bit possessive &#8212; so in the early stages, you may be monitoring each other&#8217;s comings and goings quite closely. You each like to know more about the other than you&#8217;ll tell about yourself, but you can&#8217;t get away with that here. You&#8217;ve met your match; your soul mate knows all your instincts and hot buttons. You both are intuitive and compassionate, which is wonderful because your emotional foundation together will be strong. In this relationship, you lovers communicate without speaking, by using your uncommonly expressive eyes. With a wink, a glance, or a gaze, you can transmit paragraphs of information.</p>
<p>Go ahead, for this could be the love of your life. You want intensity, and you&#8217;ve got it with this lover.</p>
