			<p>Got your eye on a Twin? You&#8217;ve met your match! This winsome lover has charm to spare and is as mesmerizing as a dancing flame. You both need lots of excitement &#8212; both of you get bored easily. You both juggle things exceedingly well, and together you&#8217;ll be running a mile a minute. This is a match of two great communicators, with lots of activities and friends. You&#8217;ll have impassioned debates and cook up grand schemes on a near-daily basis. One thing you will never run out of is new ideas, so put them to good use anywhere and anytime! Your Gemini will be an excellent &#8220;town crier&#8221; for you, for few signs get the word out as easily and as effectively as Gemini. At times you may feel you have your own proud personal PR agent.</p>
<p>You are the pioneer in the relationship and will want to get your way most of time. Luckily, Gemini is a <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/three-qualities/mutable/">mutable</a> sign, and will be happy to let you have your way without complaint. Gemini have their own projects to pursue, so their ego rarely gets riled. If it does, there&#8217;s no reason to fear. Gemini will let it out and be done with their complaint; they don&#8217;t hold grudges. A Gemini&#8217;s presence will seem like a breath of fresh air, and bless him or her for it.</p>
<p>In bed, you generate more heat and passion, but since Geminis mirror behavior so well, you&#8217;ll soon bring your lover up to your level. Just be sure to slow down a little, Aries. You both are in a hurry, tumbling pell-mell toward the next great thing. When you make love, it might be a good idea to stop and savor your time together.</p>
<p>Since both of you live in the moment, hopefully one of you will also do some serious planning for your future. Neither of you is ultra-practical, or good with detail. You might think about hiring an outside advisor to organize you &#8212; but be sure you listen to them and act on the advice he or she gives!</p>
<p>A life that sparkles like a diamond is what you two have in store. Hang on to your honey!</p>
