			<p>You&#8217;ve found a soul mate. You and Cancer want the same things: family, home, stability, security, and a nice nest egg. Both of you are sensual, and Cancer&#8217;s innate ESP will sense your every wish before you can even open your mouth. Your lover will baby you so you will get the hint and baby them back &#8212; something Cancers love. How can this relationship fail? It should be cuddly, close and cozy warm during your private time together.</p>
<p>As a Taurus, you probably keep your Cancer lover supplied with herbs from the garden and flowers for the dining table. Your Cancer shows love best by cooking and you are happy to accept such tasty offerings. You both love to eat and whip up amazing dishes together, so you can start your seduction process in the kitchen and later head to the bedroom.</p>
<p>Having enough money means a lot to you both, although Taurus will spend for more luxuries than will Cancer. Cancer will buy a wonderful coat and wear it for a decade. Taurus will buy insurance, stocks and bonds, and then spend the rest on a stereo or a new car. Cancer will buy enough food to supply a small bomb shelter and bank the rest of the money in a conservative, safe, savings account. If your Cancer lover needs something special, he or she will wait for a sale or get it wholesale. You, on the other hand, are enjoy shopping retail in fine boutiques. If Cancers need more money, they&#8217;ll cut back on expenses. If you need more money, you&#8217;ll march out and find a better job, an additional job, or a new investment strategy that generates more income. This difference in money style doesn&#8217;t matter in the end, for the result is the same &#8212; a bigger bank account. Unlike Leos or Capricorns who need money to earn respect, you and Cancer just need it to have a happier life.</p>
<p>In bed, thanks to your earthy erotic style and Cancer&#8217;s deeply emotional approach to love, you have a passionate, nurturing union of two souls. Taurus like to take their time seducing their sweethearts, which is just fine with a Cancer. Since you only get better with time, Taurus, and hit your sexual peak later in life, you and your lover have a lot to look forward to! Cancer will want little love notes now and then or at least some candles around the bedroom. Can you oblige by being more romantic? Try! When you make love you are both as tender as can be and so genuine in your expression of feelings. What more could either of you ask?</p>
