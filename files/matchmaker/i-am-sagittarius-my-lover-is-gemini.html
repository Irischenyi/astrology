			<p>This relationship is all about brains. If you two have children, they are sure to have high IQ&#8217;s with the two of you for parents! This relationship will be about broadening horizons and continuous discovery. In short, it is one that is fundamentally very right for you!</p>
<p>In the scheme of things, Gemini specialize in day-to-day news, which is why your lover&#8217;s sign is considered the sign of the journalist. Your sign is singled out to collect the knowledge of humanity and make sense of it all &#8212; Sagittarius is the sign of the philosopher. Gemini may tease you and say you are too high-concept and theoretical. You may rib Gemini back and say he or she is too distracted by &#8220;who&#8217;s doing what, when&#8221; to see the big picture. There is a grain of truth in each position; however, every sign of the zodiac is given a piece of the puzzle of life. In your case, your <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/fire/">fire</a> sign relates beautifully to your lover&#8217;s <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/air/">air</a> sign. You both adore travel, and are ready to jump on a plane to anywhere, no matter how remote or exotic &#8220;anywhere&#8221; may be! Sharing this zest for discovery of the new will always keep your relationship fresh.</p>
<p>The only slight problem with this match is that you both are so brainy &#8212; you think so much, when will you have a moment to feel? Hopefully, one, or both, of you has a few dominant water planets in your personal horoscopes to add more emotion to this relationship. Otherwise, you both will be so analytical about things that you&#8217;ll give one another a headache. But this isn&#8217;t really likely if you take care. This is a pairing that works naturally, without a lot of effort.</p>
<p>In bed, you really shine, for both of you are verbal, playful, witty, and have a delightful sense of humor. Look forward to a sex life filled with spice, variety and spontaneity. The fun only brings you closer together.</p>
