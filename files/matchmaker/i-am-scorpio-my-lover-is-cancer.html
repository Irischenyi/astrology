			<p>Are you in love with a Cancer? Then you have chosen one of your best possible matches. This pairing gets a &#8220;10!&#8221; Your Cancer is as deeply emotional and empathetic as you are, and together you will develop a rich, intimate life unequalled by any other sign match (except for Pisces and Scorpio). Both of you have your moods, but you allow that in one another, and view the changing emotional landscape as interesting and adding texture to your life. Cancer is a <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/water/">water</a> sign like you, and your lover understands the need for strong, intuitive bonding. Of the two, you are the more inflexible, but Cancer&#8217;s ability to flow with changing events will be an asset to you.</p>
<p>Sex together will be outstanding. Cancers want a family, and Scorpio rules procreation, so this could well be a very fruitful union. Cancer also rules nurturing, so you will have the kind of home life you always dreamed of.</p>
<p>Now a word of warning: Scorpios want one great love in their lifetime, so if they marry the wrong person due to pressures and circumstances, the results can be disastrous. Prince Charles is a Scorpio and was married to Princess Diana, who was a Cancer. But his true love was the other Cancer &#8212; Camilla. So here you see a Cancer-Scorpio pair that did not last. The moral, Scorpio, is to be sure that you marry your one true love. Even compatible Sun signs can&#8217;t override that rule!</p>
<p>A Cancer in love, whether in the beginning or after years of life together, offers food as an expression of love. So cook together, feed one another, make love in the kitchen. Have fun! You&#8217;ve got lots to look forward to, Scorpio. Don&#8217;t let this one get away!</p>
