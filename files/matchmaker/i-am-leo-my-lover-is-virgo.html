			<p>Always fashionable, crisp, and well groomed, it is hard for Leo not to be proud of elegant Virgo. Your Virgo is precise, detailed, and prefers work to play. How is this last attribute possible? Born at the very end of summer, Virgo has been programmed by nature to reap what has been sown and to be highly productive. Nothing will deter Virgos from their assignment: not theater tickets, dinner at a new bistro, frolicking with you in the woods like a woodland nymph &#8212; nothing. Don&#8217;t even try. You, on the other hand, have been programmed to play and to be creative. (Play and creativity go hand in hand in astrology, as they do in life.) If you are skeptical, consider this: Leo is ruled by the Sun, which governs the <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-12-sectors/fifth-house/">5th house</a> (fun and love). Virgo is ruled by Mercury, which governs the <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-12-sectors/sixth-house/">6th house</a> (work and services to others). Check it out.</p>
<p>Now that you have a better understanding of your Virgo lover, perhaps you can be somewhat gentler with his or her concerns, and their delicate digestive systems. You will see you have to take time to relax them before you make love, and to make sure lingering thoughts of unwritten reports, unwashed dishes, or ungraded papers need not interfere with the moment. Underneath that high IQ lurks a passionate lover dying for your touch to make him or her feel human again. Who better than a loving Leo to make things right? Virgos will let down their reserve when they feel safe with you and know you won&#8217;t double-time them. Virgo&#8217;s sense of integrity is strong, and they want yours to be, too. An <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/earth/">earth</a> sign, they are tactile and deeply erotic, although they will never flaunt their sexuality in public. They have a reputation for being cool and detached, when nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>Virgos&#8217; minds are alert and they are eagle-eyed when it comes to flaws. They are born idealists and never see things as they are, but rather as how good they can be. Other signs call Virgos critical, but Virgos feel they simply see things clearly &#8212; things others miss. You must not take advantage of your dazzling, polished and refined Virgo. If your pride makes you order your Virgo lover around or generally treat him or her in a shabby way, your Virgo will be polite and take it at first. But the hurt will build up if this continues and your lover will retaliate as only a Virgo can: with articulation that cuts to the bone. You, Leo, will get your assessment all at once, and Virgo will quit you, never to return. After reaching that point, Virgo couldn&#8217;t very well expect to change you, Leo, for your pride is very, very important for you to preserve.</p>
<p>But you are good for your Virgo, forcing him or her out to have fun in spite of him or herself. Your lover will know this too, which is why he or she gravitated to you. You know your organizational skills are pathetic, but Virgos excel in this area and, with their eye for detail, nothing falls between the cracks. A <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/three-qualities/mutable/">mutable</a> sign, Virgo will never challenge your role at the helm, but will be content to follow your lead, right down to correcting the grammar on your proposals. Soon you may wonder how on earth you ever got along without your Virgo!</p>
<p>Virgos are worriers, which can drive you nuts when you wake up in the middle of the night to hear your lover padding the floor. When that happens, they need your gentle but strong touch to let them know everything will be alright in the end. You can reassure them more easily than you think.</p>
<p>Virgos are more unlike than like you, but ultimately, Virgos are good for you. Their earth element will offer you a safe harbor, and a solid, practical base from which to send up your trial balloons. Give this relationship a good chance.</p>
