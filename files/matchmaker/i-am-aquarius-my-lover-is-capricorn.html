<h1>i-am-aquarius-my-lover-is-capricorn<h1>

			<p><span class="text">This match will work well only if you have some important water or earth planets somewhere in your chart. This is because your sign follows Capricorn in the zodiac. The sign that immediately follows another sign is very different in many ways, because it makes up for what the prior sign lacks. Capricorns ask Aquarius why they put so much emphasis on future planning. Capricorn rules history and the past, and so your lover enjoys old movies, browsing for antiques, and reflecting on the museum dinosaur collection. You, on the other hand, are anxious to get back to your web surfing, or over to your local electronics store to look at the new and faster computers. Capricorns would rather spend their money on a rare document or an old, valuable quilt; your orientations are very different.</span></p>
<p class="text">Still, this does not doom the relationship as long as you enjoy your differences. You probably enjoy the fact that your lover is rooted in reality and is practical and hard working. Capricorns care about their reputations, but at times their social consciousness will irritate you. Aquarius don&#8217;t try to keep up with the Joneses, but your lover might think your blase attitude isn&#8217;t quite respectful. They will enjoy your freewheeling thinking, though (especially because it is so alien to them) and your experimental approach to life.</p>
<p class="text">Capricorns are basically more materialistic than Aquarius, but this could be helpful to you, since your partner will have the patience to set up your retirement portfolio and make it grow. You may not see the need for all this now, but later in life you&#8217;ll be happy for it. If your situation is such that the Capricorn depends on you to support him or her for a period of time (say, after your children are born), you could experience the most difficulty; your Capricorn is ambitious and will want to see progress in your career, both in status and salary. You are not entirely self-oriented &#8212; your role is to work for the good of the organization &#8212; and your plans tend to be long-term. So a Capricorn&#8217;s influence could be good or bad, depending on how you feel about the input. Your lover may have to learn to live without immediate gratification from your career.</p>
<p class="text">Sexually, <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/earth/">earth</a> signs like Capricorn are sensual and tactile. You are less so, so you will either get with the program or hear some complaints. Still, I think you will find ways to satisfy your partner, because you receive information and feedback so well. You&#8217;re a good communicator, and you approach sex like anything else in your life &#8212; as something that can be analyzed and improved. Aquarius is the sign of the objective scientist who draws up a hypothesis and then observes carefully, taking in data and finding out if the thesis can be proven. This approach may be too cool for Capricorn, who aches for you to show more animal passion!</p>
<p><span class="text">We are all more than our Sun sign &#8212; the stars suggest, but do not dictate, how we act. Love and understanding can override most problems, so know where the difficulties are (not always an easy task) and face them head-on. Use your magical power of communication, Aquarius. You can make this relationship work well if you try.</span></p>
