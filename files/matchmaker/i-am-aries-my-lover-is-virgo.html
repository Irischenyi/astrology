			<p>Do your friends keep telling how very different you are from your Virgo? You&#8217;ve known this all along. If your relationship seems to be working, it is a testament to your good nature and determination to succeed.</p>
<p>There are some things to be aware of. Your Virgo lover is very industrious, just as you are, but you both assert your energy in different ways. Virgos wake up in the morning and know what they expect to accomplish by the end of the day. If they don&#8217;t finish, then just like the little Energizer bunny, they keep on going, and going, and going &#8217;till they&#8217;re done and satisfied with their performance. They don&#8217;t need a boss to push them; their ambition is strong enough on its own. They wouldn&#8217;t dream of disappointing others (or themselves) by not coming through on what they&#8217;ve said they&#8217;ll do. Living up to promises is a big deal to Virgos.</p>
<p>While you see the big picture, have more courage, and are better at networking, your lover is a wizard at details and organization. With your sweetheart at your side, you can become stronger. You will have a better chance of seeing your dreams come true &#8212; task-oriented Virgo will remind you of things yet to do and support your efforts 100% of the time. They are also more flexible and can present you with options when you face an obstacle or a crisis.</p>
<p>Yet Virgos see flaws where you may see none and, of course, they have a way of always being right. Sometimes you may feel like you&#8217;re with a taskmaster and feel like nothing will ever be perfect enough to please your sweetie. Realize that your lover is not challenging your abilities but polishing up your style. Your lover wants to make sure you shine out there in the world! Keep your ego in check. If you take note of your Virgo&#8217;s advice, you&#8217;ll soon be very, very successful. I am convinced that behind every phenomenal Aries is a caring, attentive Virgo.</p>
<p>In bed, you are the take-charge type, while your Virgo is more reserved and willing to let you set the pace. This description is not tied to gender. Aries women can be downright thrilling in bed because they know what they want and go for it. Virgo is an ideal partner for Aries because they not only speak up (ruled by talkative <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-planets/mercury/">Mercury</a>, how could they not?) but they describe gently, with care, what they need you to do. If communication is nine-tenths of compatibility, you two have it made. Still, the chemistry between you could use some tempering. Your Virgo needs to be soothed a little after that long day of work in order to get in the proper mood. You can&#8217;t get lazy with the task of soothing them down, even if you&#8217;ve been together for decades. Your impulse to jump right in will leave your lover a wreck. The seduction tactics you choose are going to be very important &#8212; if you get it right, the result will be a delectable dance as you each try your very best to please the other.</p>
