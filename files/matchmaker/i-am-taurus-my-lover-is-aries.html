			<p>You and Aries couldn&#8217;t be more different. But this may be the very reason you are drawn together! Your Aries lover is full of fire, light, energy and enthusiasm, bright ideas and fresh starts. You, on the other hand, prefer to be safe and sound. &#8220;If it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it&#8221; is your motto. Yet your beloved Aries will never be content to leave well enough alone. Noisy, rambunctious, and always testing their physical strength and resolute willpower, Aries usually win. Don&#8217;t even try to tell Aries what to do, for they don&#8217;t take advice too readily. Aries rules the life force, with me-first intensity, but at times Aries&#8217; impetuousness can led them into trouble.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where you come in, Taurus. You are the anchor in Aries all too frenetic life &#8212; you&#8217;re the steady rock in the Aries storm. They thrive on crisis, but at times it can get too much, even for them! Your soothing voice, your tender touch makes everything all better again. Be aware that Aries&#8217; role is to initiate, and Taurus&#8217; is to react and preserve. So you might become increasingly stubborn if your Aries is constantly goading you to do, do, do! Passive resistance only gets Aries mad, so your Bull&#8217;s horns may lock with your Ram&#8217;s more frequently than you&#8217;d like. Don&#8217;t let this happen too often or you&#8217;ll derail the relationship.</p>
<p>Sexually, you have very different physical rhythms. Your style of lovemaking is slow as melted chocolate, and just as sensual. For you, slowly is the very best way to savor one another. Aries, on the other hand, is a bundle of energy and quite a little firecracker in bed &#8212; quick, hot, and right to the point. This can be frustrating when you want to linger, though, and you will both have to be sensitive to one another if you are to succeed under the covers. You are so erotic, lusty, and sensuous that your chances of winning your Aries over are good &#8212; so be confident! Few can resist falling under the spell of Taurus.</p>
<p>Your lover will bring you lots of excitement and show you how not to play life so close to the vest. Aries have courage to spare and you admire this enormously. Taurus, you know how to build things and make them last, so you each have a great deal to give one another. If you love your Aries, try to make it work &#8212; and don&#8217;t be too stubborn!</p>
