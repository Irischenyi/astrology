<h1>i-am-aries-my-lover-is-scorpio<h1>

			<p class="text">This is a noisy, passionate, ardent combination of two <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-planets/mars/">Mars</a>-ruled lovers, guaranteeing a relationship filled with action. Neither of you do anything half-heartedly and you both have strong, powerful convictions. This is not a classic astrological love-match mainly because winning is so important to each of you. Still, if you were to give this relationship a try, I&#8217;d bet it would be lots of fun. It could last &#8212; but you are going to have to put in the effort.</p>
<p>In bed, you two have nearly insatiable appetites, which is good, for you will enjoy one another to the hilt. Both of you have tons of energy and passion, although your Scorpio&#8217;s feelings may run deeper than your own. As an Aries, sometimes you don&#8217;t delve down to their emotional depth. They have a need to be understood and you will have to try. But you will be able to act out all your fantasies with this amazing person who will &#8220;let you be you.&#8221; Your lover is a master at technique and more sensual than you, so you could pick up some lovely insights from them, too.</p>
<p>Be aware that your Scorpio will demand complete loyalty and fidelity. You will get the same in return. This means, Aries, that your roving eye has to close shut if you want to keep your Scorpio. But too often, no flirting, no frolicking, and no frivolity on the side means no fun to you. You aren&#8217;t sure you want to be anyone&#8217;s one-and-only, an issue you will have to resolve early in this relationship. On that point alone you may find yourself at a make-it-or-break-it juncture.</p>
<p>Still, this is such a vivacious relationship, if you love a Scorpio and are willing to duke out the issues, what you stand to gain will make it all worthwhile.</p>
