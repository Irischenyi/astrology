			<p class="text">A wondrous adventure awaits you in this lover made just for you. You were drawn to their mysterious, detached demeanor, their sharp analytical thinking and innovative style. You&#8217;re a rebel at the core, so with this heartthrob, you&#8217;ve met your match. Together you can really make your mark on the world, for Aquarius&#8217;s role is to point out flaws in society&#8217;s thinking and make the planet a better place to live. Since neither of you craves social approval, you can forge onward and challenge the status quo, either politically or by exploring new markets in business. You are both future-oriented, so you speak the same language. Neither of one of you will ever think yesterday was sweeter than what tomorrow will bring.</p>
<p>You communicate especially well, for your lover is <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/air/">air</a>, you are <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/fire/">fire</a>, two elements that blend magnificently. You want to be the boss, which is usually fine with your other half, for Aquarius likes to pursue their own projects with complete freedom. For both of you, absence makes the heart grow fonder, so you agree that independence is to be prized. Aquarius does not want to meld identities in marriage &#8212; they want both partners to be separate but united entities &#8212; so they won&#8217;t suffocate your spirit. However, they are far less flexible than you are, so be warned: If you hit a point that they seem adamant about, they probably won&#8217;t budge an inch.</p>
<p>You bring just the right touch of teasing and titillation into the bedroom, for you&#8217;ll adore Aquarius&#8217; impulsive, surprising lovemaking style. Your lover will do nothing the same from one day to the next, and that&#8217;s just fine with you. Still, you might find him or her initially hard to get close to. This could puzzle you. Since Aquarius is so outwardly charming and friendly, you might not notice your lover is holding you at arm&#8217;s length. You have the ability to break down this barrier, so I doubt it will remain a problem. Both of you will create the space you each need so badly in any relationship. Luckily, you both agree in the axiom, &#8220;If you want something, let it go. If it doesn&#8217;t come back, it was never yours to begin with.&#8221; You are right, for possessiveness would make the relationship claustrophobic for either of you.</p>
<p>Your Aquarius may be hard to understand at times, even a bit unpredictable or wacky, but this is what drew you to him or her first, anyway. This is a frisky, fresh and fabulous union, so go for it!</p>
