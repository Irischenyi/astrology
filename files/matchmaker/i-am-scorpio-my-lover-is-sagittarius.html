			<p>Sometimes the most interesting relationships develop when opposites attract. You&#8217;re intense and shrewdly realistic, able to see through people&#8217;s hidden agendas in the blink of an eye. Sagittarius are all sunny optimism, and hopelessly impressionable. This is a hard mix, because you are a <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/three-qualities/fixed/">fixed</a> (somewhat intractable) <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/water/">water</a> sign in love with a <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/three-qualities/mutable/">mutable</a> (flexible) <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/fire/">fire</a>Â sign. If your lover&#8217;s water element doesn&#8217;t put out the fire in your relationship early on, you stand a good chance of success.</p>
<p>Primarily an intellectual sign, Sagittarius do not have your capacity for deep emotions and passion, nor your sharp intuition. They see themselves as basically objective and rational, but you understand that facts can be deceptive. You trust your gut instincts implicitly, but still you don&#8217;t want to be put in the position of having to justify your instinct-based conclusions.</p>
<p>Sagittarius are very communicative &#8212; virtual chatterboxes &#8212; and they adore intellectual debates, no matter which side of the question they&#8217;re on. You find all this talk wearing. If you wanted to debate everything you&#8217;d be on Crossfire or Meet the Press. But Sagittarius watch the Discovery Channel for kicks. Good grief! That&#8217;s entertainment? While Sagittarius fantasize about taking a trek through Africa, you just want to chill out in your hammock at home. You&#8217;d rather unwind in front of an action drama, a murder mystery, or even the Playboy channel. But these low-brow flights of fantasy make Sagittarius leave the room in disgust. The TV remote control wars begin &#8212; troubles, troubles.</p>
<p>And it gets worse: You are a compassionate water sign, but your Sagittarius is brutally honest. Your lover&#8217;s comments roll over you on occasion with the subtlety of a tank; while you can take constructive, sensitive feedback, you bristle at Sagittarius&#8217; style. You want to get married, Sagittarius isn&#8217;t ready. They will delay commitment as long as possible, for they have bigger things to do first. Sexually, they want a light touch without all the opera.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, I have laid it on rather thick. I see you&#8217;re disappointed. I can hear you protest that you love your Sagittarius. Perhaps you have a lot of fire and <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/air/">air</a> in your chart, which would make this union work. My advice is to know one another well before you make plans for the future. Stay together for at least a few years. What if you already know you love him or her? Then hang on. You may be relishing the differences that would drive other couples apart.</p>
