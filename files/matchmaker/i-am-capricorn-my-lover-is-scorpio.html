			<p>This is a sensational match! You bring common sense and solid grounding to the relationship; your lover is drawn to your stability and practical nature. You&#8217;re attracted to Scorpio&#8217;s intense emotions and their passion for life &#8212; and for you. Scorpio&#8217;s <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/water/">water</a> sign element mixes well with your <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/earth/">earth</a> and creates a fertile environment in which you both can grow in</p>
<p>Scorpios are street smart, and, when combined with your financial savvy, Capricorn, you two are a good combination. Amassing wealth is a worthy goal to you, and one you are serious about pursuing. If your other half were bent on spending your stash as fast as you make it, you wouldn&#8217;t be together long. This certainly is not the problem with a Scorpio spouse. Like you, they are intensely hard workers, determined and fixed on goals. You are the more flexible one, and you will find that talking a Scorpio out of something is nearly impossible. You may admire this or find it hard to deal with, depending on the situation. You are research and fact-oriented, so you may have to get used to trusting their razor-sharp intuition. But soon you&#8217;ll see that your Scorpios is right on the money nearly every time he or she has a gut feeling about something.</p>
<p>Outwardly, you two are reserved and discrete, so don&#8217;t be concerned that your lover would ever reveal anything private to the outside world. Scorpio wouldn&#8217;t dream of doing a &#8220;kiss and tell.&#8221; You may have to get used to his or her periods of withdrawal while your Scorpio lover chews over something that&#8217;s bothering him or her. (This is true whether you are the cause or not.) Your Scorpio may not be immediately sure what the problem is, so don&#8217;t get paranoid; Scorpios need time to think. Try to gently get your lover to open up and talk &#8212; it will help you to have a better relationship.</p>
<p>In bed you are awestruck by your Scorpio&#8217;s flaming passion. The Scorpio&#8217;s ardor can truly take your breath away and leave you wanting more! Better yet, you need not be concerned that your Scorpio will stray; Scorpios tend to mate for life. Scorpios are never wishy-washy about anything, including who they marry! Remember: Scorpio is the sign of obsession, and you&#8217;re the lucky recipient of all their desire!</p>
<p>This pairing deserves a resounding yes! No matter what difficulties you encounter, you are likely to succeed.</p>
