			<p>Here&#8217;s a heavenly match if there ever was one! Capricorn, you&#8217;ve found the one love mate who won&#8217;t continually ask you why you have to work so hard; your Virgo is an equal workaholic! Both of you are <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/earth/">earth</a> signs, making you click on a primordial level.</p>
<p>You two may have to trade off being the one who reminds the other to come home early or break away from the computer once in a while to enjoy some hot, earthy, sensual sex! Virgo is often depicted as the cosmic librarian, with hair pinned back tightly and glasses firmly in place. Don&#8217;t kid yourself; Virgo can be one of the sexiest creatures in the Universe. Because they communicate so precisely, they know how to get sexual satisfaction &#8212; and how to give it.</p>
<p>The power of your union lies in the ability you share to develop a vision of the future and make it happen. With two earth signs you&#8217;ve got goals, deadlines, and rewards to keep you motivated as you move closer to your ultimate goal. Security is very important to you, and with a Virgo lover, success is assured.</p>
<p>All in all, this pairing gets a &#8220;10,&#8221; so press forward!</p>
