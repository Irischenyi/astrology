<h1>i-am-pisces-my-lover-is-libra<h1>

			<p>Libra is ruled by gentle <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-planets/venus/">Venus</a> and therefore your lover is refined, polished, sophisticated and elegant. This personality profile mixes well with Pisces, even though this is not a classic astrological pairing. Libra is an <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/air/">air</a> sign and Pisces is <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/water/">water</a>, so if you play your cards right, you will have a bubbly union.</p>
<p>Libras are very social and like to go out all the time. But Pisces are self-reliant and need to spend time alone in reflection and meditation; Libras think Pisces spend far too much time alone. If you are willing to respect and go along with each other&#8217;s needs, this could be a fun match. Libras adore cultural activities and fine restaurants, which will get you out and about. Libras know the hottest clubs and like to dress fashionably. Pisces base their satisfaction on emotional and spiritual contentment rather than on material gain or social competition, so they can take or leave Libras&#8217; gregarious lifestyle. For example, Pisces might like to dabble in the cocktail circuit now and then and will even benefit from all the contacts a Libra brings into his or her life, but Pisces may not want to spend as much time out and about as a Libra. After a long day, a cozy night at home reading or watching TV to unwind sounds good to Pisces.</p>
<p>Another possible hitch in the relationship from your perspective is the Libra tendency to over-analyze things. You trust your emotions more than Libras trusts theirs, so conflicts could arise when your Libra asks you to justify your position &#8212; how do you explain your gut instincts to someone so supremely logical? Also, Libras can be a little bossy, but this is asserted in a charming, diplomatic way. Pisces read others&#8217; motives perfectly, and although you can see through Libras&#8217; veil of gentility, you appreciate their effort not to be too brash about pursuing their own agenda. Thus, you often let them have their own way. If you disagree, you will be sensitive to one another&#8217;s positions, and diplomatic Libra will likely not hurt your feelings. Libra, symbolized by the scales, cares about finding a fair solution, something strongly in your favor.</p>
<p>Happily, Libra lights up your house of physical love and things could be hot, hot, hot in bed. Pisces are not likely to let the physical part of your relationship overtake the other areas. You need an emotional partner in life, and if your bubbly Libra can slow down long enough to give you the nurturing you need, this could be a great match.</p>
