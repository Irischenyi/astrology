	    	<p class="text">The Scorpio woman likes things that are well-crafted with classic tailoring. Get her a smart, black suit she can wear in a number of ways, or a beautiful silk blouse or outfit in her lucky color: burgundy. Get her an English trench coat, an Italian umbrella, or a fashionable French leather handbag that she will have forever. If she works, give her a beautiful attache case of buttery, smooth black leather.</p>
<p class="text">A thoughtful gift if she goes out often at night would be something to put in her purse to keep her safe, whether a special alarm, a light for her keys, an automatic garage opener or a purse-sized cellular phone. Or get her an intercom so she can hear what is going on in various rooms.</p>
<p class="text">She is intensely private and highly individual and would adore personalized, engraved stationary from the finest stationers. Scorpio women like to collect sexy, lacy lingerie in a variety of colors, black to nude, deep purple to bright red. From push-up bras to garter belts to wear with seamed stockings and pumps, the Scorpio woman is a true femme fatal. A water sign, she could never have too much perfume (she wants the real stuff, not cologne.) Her signature perfume is musk or a haunting floral-oriental.</p>
