<h1>aquarius-woman<h1>

	    	<p class="text">The Aquarius woman is the quintessential modern woman and like the Aquarius man, she adores things that run on electricity. She wants a photo CD player, a personal fax machine, a beeper with voice mail, or a video palmcorder.</p>
<p class="text">Astrology is ruled by her sign, so give her a reading by a professional astrologer or find her some interesting books on the subject. Her sign rules friendship, so find a pretty silver friendship ring to remember you. She might like a perpetual calendar to keep track of her pal&#8217;s birthdays (a good one is one I wrote this year, The Astrology Book of Days. Published by Warner Books).</p>
<p class="text">She is fascinated by crystals, so get her a pretty pendant. If you buy her clothes, make them highly fashionable. Her best color is cobalt blue, fuchsia or a soft charcoal gray. In fragrance, buy her Donna Karen&#8217;s Chaos, which is what her ruler, Uranus, governs! (She&#8217;ll like the unusual crystal bottle Chaos comes in too.) You might give her a certificate for an aromatheraphy massage&#8211;she&#8217;ll be in heaven. Finally, probably one of the most original gifts you can give her is to name a star after her at the Star Registry (yes, a real star in the galaxy!)</p>
