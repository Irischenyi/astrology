	    	<p class="text">Your Gemini loves to read, so choose some new books&#8211;be sure they&#8217;re all best-sellers. Since Gemini is the travel sign, you might get him a new overnight bag or a fine leather toiletry case. Of course, airline tickets to just about anywhere send his spirits soaring.</p>
<p class="text">Sending and getting e-mail is fun for a Gemini, so pay for a year of his Internet access. Gemini also adores gadgets, so you might find him zany things for his car like a wide rear view mirror or a dashboard cup-holder for his coffee. One of the new electronic voice memo-takers would also be handy. There is a new phone (at Sharper Image) that allows the user to change his voice to 16 different identities. A Gemini would love that phone (Geminis live on the phone because they are ruled by Mercury, the winged messenger)&#8211;if only to prank friends or to pretend his new business has 17 employees. A special barometer or thermometer would help him dress properly for the weather&#8211;Gemini is rarely home. Give him a modern, stainless steel wide-mouth thermos for hot and cold foods for the same reason.</p>
<p class="text">He also likes to take classes, so you could give him one to sharpen his pool game or one to teach him more about all kinds of wine. Finally, he&#8217;s got a good sense of humor. Send him a membership for the boxer shorts-of-the-month club!</p>
