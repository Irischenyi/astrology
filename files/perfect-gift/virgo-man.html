	    	<p class="text">Virgo is a highly productive sign. Give your Virgo man an exciting state-of-the-art laptop computer, with extra batteries (very important), so he can work on the run. Or get him a Macintosh Newton, that he can use to fax anywhere, any time as well as keep tract of other office functions. This Mercury ruled native needs to communicate constantly!</p>
<p class="text">He reads a lot, so buy him new halogen desk lamp or an itty bitty book light to read while on the commuter train. Give him a sophisticated wireless head set for his phone, so he can talk hands free. He also likes to stay healthy, so fresh fruit-of-the month club is a great idea, as is a 12-month membership at a nearby gym. Since he enjoys working with his hands, get him an electronic drill, or, to clean up his car (Virgo likes things neat), a portable vacuum cleaner. An electric shoe polisher would be a hit too, or a deluxe tool kit with many unusual and hard-to-find- implements inside.</p>
<p class="text">The Virgo man is smart and highly intellectual. He loves books and intellectual puzzles so give him a gift certificate to a book shop to stock up on more. Don&#8217;t forget new interesting software&#8211;very high on Virgo&#8217;s list. When you choose it, remember to include the clip of the review from the magazine that sold you on it&#8211;he&#8217;ll be impressed.</p>
