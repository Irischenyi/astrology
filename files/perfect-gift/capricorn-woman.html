	    	<p>Capricorn is the pretty coed you knew in college, the one who looked like Grace Kelly and wore cashmere twin sweater sets. Buy her a set in butterscotch or a soft pastel color. For cold winter nights, get her lambskin slippers to keep her pretty pink toes warm. Since this sign rules things of value from the past, surprise her with a piece estate jewelry you purchased at auction, or a pair of your Grandmother&#8217;s pearls or diamond earrings. She loves most antiques, so you might choose a beautiful old quilt for her bedroom along with some antique cotton lace pillows, or Oriental bowl for her mantle. Replicas are fine if well done, perhaps bought at a museum shop. Another great idea would be an authentic Schwinn bike, replicated from the 1950&#8217;s that are all the rage among the status set. (They don&#8217;t come cheap, so if you live in New York where bikes get ripped off daily, think twice.) An old radio, real or a replica of the 1920&#8217;s could make a hit too. She is career-oriented, so buy her a fine attache case, portfolio or a filofax to keep her appointments. For fragrance, she prefers classic scents from France.</p>
