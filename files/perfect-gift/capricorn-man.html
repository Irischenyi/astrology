	    	<p class="text">This man enjoys any kind of financial gift, such as stocks and savings bonds. If that&#8217;s not your thing, buy him a coin bank that automatically sorts change into rolls (nickels, dimes and so forth). You could give him a little sack of gold coins, valuable stamps, or an antique ring. This sign is status conscious, so choose a good retailer at which to purchase his gifts and make them classic rather than trendy. He&#8217;d like a white silk scarf to wear with his tuxedo, a cashmere sweater, a pair of brown leather driving gloves, or a pair of sturdy, comfortable hiking boots (Capricorn rules mountains and earth).</p>
<p class="text">Does he like history? Most Capricorns do, so if choosing a book, pick an historical theme or a non-fiction book on a subject that interests him. A chess set with ivory pieces would be a generous gesture. A fine, single malt scotch would be an elegant gesture. If the prize patrol comes to your door telling you you&#8217;ve hit the jackpot, buy him an 1957 Chevy in mint condition. Otherwise, If he plays golf, name, buy him a new golf putter, chocolates in a golf motif, or software on how to improve his game.</p>
<p class="text">Get him tickets to the hottest comedy club in town or surprise him with the silly, wacky Monty Python&#8217;s Complete Waste of Time, a strategy CD-ROM game that offers stupid songs, bizarre sounds and kooky screen savers. Or give him the Simpsons Screen Saver. The book, BOSSES AND OTHER REPTILES, which is a humorous but realistic look at corporate politics, would be something that would give your Capricorn man a kick.</p>
