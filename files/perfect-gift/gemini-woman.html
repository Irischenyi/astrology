	    	<p class="text">Lily-of-the-Valley is one of Gemini&#8217;s favorite flowers, so send her a nosegay or give her soaps, lotions and cologne in that scent. Her need to communicate is strong&#8211;find her an elegant pen (rollerball or fountain pens are good) or go with her to a fine shop to select personal stationary for her on the finest fiber paper, compete with a printer&#8217;s die for her engraved initials. She would love a personal fax machine, beeper, or a purse-size cellular phone to help her stay in touch.</p>
<p class="text">She also likes new accessories to change her look, so buy her a new thin belt with sterling silver buckle, a small leather backpack (instead of a purse) by Prada or a fashionable piece of costume jewelry that she chooses with you. She is on the go a lot, so the chances are, she needs new luggage. Make it one of those new pieces with rollers on the bottom, or a handsome carry-on bag for weekend getaways.</p>
<p class="text">Your Gemini girl likes to do two things at once, so get her wireless, cordless radio/head phones set to listen to while she works. Or surprise her with a little bitty reading light to use on train or when a passenger in a car at night. She loves to write, so give her a beautifully bound diary, with lock and key. Finally, a Stuben glass paperweight would be an elegant addition to her pretty glass desk.</p>
