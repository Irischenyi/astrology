	    	<p class="text">Libra&#8217;s favorite gift is fine jewelry, so choose something elegant she wouldn&#8217;t buy herself, such as a opal ring or a gorgeous sapphire necklace. Libras have a busy social lives, so if you buy her a tiny evening purse, new silk evening pumps or a silk shawl, you can be confident she&#8217;ll use them often. Libra uses perfumes and body lotions as part of her allure&#8211;she can never have too many. Then too, she can&#8217;t have too much sexy lingerie. Give her a new teddy or a camisole with tap pants in a soft champagne color. Her sign is ruled by Venus, planet of beauty and grace, so naturally, she will adore fresh flowers. One Libra I know skillfully dries her roses and hangs them upside down in her country French bedroom, for a soft, feminine look. She says even silk flowers if done very, very well could be beautiful.</p>
<p class="text">Libra would like to have a new home accessory, such as a pot in the Libra-ruled metal: copper. Give her an elegant clock, a signed lithograph or gilt-edged mirror for her foyer. A perfectly round cut-crystal vase to hold sweetheart roses would be divine. If your Libra is a college girl, give her a graphic poster for her dorm room or something from the museum. She is a people person, so if you buy her a book, give her a riveting biography, or appeal to her funny bone, with Chuck Jones&#8217; CHUCK REDUCKS, about the creator of Bugs Bunny (Warner Books). She would also enjoy chatting away online, so pay for a year of internet service in advance.</p>
