			<p>It is no wonder you fell in love with a Pisces; this is one of the most heavenly matches for you because you share a near-psychic ability to communicate. At times, all you need to do is look at one another to let each other know what&#8217;s up. Pisces is the most highly developed of the <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/water/">water</a> signs (they&#8217;re great at reading body language) and has the strongest need of all the water signs to relieve suffering in others. Pisces know your strongest fears without whispering a word, and they know how to soothe you, too. Pisces will never hurt you, for they are so easily hurt themselves.</p>
<p>Nowhere is Pisces&#8217; intuition more apparent than when you two disagree. Pisces can bypass the angry words and see your pain and frustration. The Fish swims to the depths of your underlying feelings and thoughts. They&#8217;ll unravel your psychic knots so well it&#8217;s mind-blowing! Pisces is the last sign of the zodiac, which makes them the most empathetic and in tune with the Universe. Pisces always speaks to the hidden rather than the obvious; they see so clearly.</p>
<p>You like control but Pisces isn&#8217;t into power struggles, so they don&#8217;t mind. They will be willing to have you lead because they want many of the same things you do: a stable home, children, culture, and the opportunity to express themselves creatively. Pisces are refined and elegant. You both experience the conflict between the need for solitude and a fun social life. Pisces have to spend time meditating on the deeper meaning of life, which you are also more than willing to do.</p>
<p>In the privacy of the bedroom you will encounter the full force of their emotions. Pisces never view sex as recreation, but rather as an out-of-this-world communion of two souls. Sex between you two is spiritual, lusty, powerful and ardent. Pisces will worship you, thrill you, and clasp you in the full force of their love for you. In return, you will transmit passion to your lover on a freer level than you&#8217;ve ever been able to with anyone else. You satisfy perfectly one another&#8217;s needs. As said earlier, Pisces speaks best without words, for their sign rules symbols and gesture, and this makes sex mind-blowing indeed.</p>
<p>Both of you are romantic and sentimental creatures, and will enjoy reading poetry to each other out loud, spreading the bed with rose petals, burning scented candles, and playing special music to accompany your lovemaking. There is no end to the care you will take of one another.</p>
<p>Pisces are not usually oriented toward making money, so hopefully you can make a major contribution. Still, there are Pisces who do very well financially in the creative arts. Pisces must go with the careers their hearts dictate to them, or they will be miserable. Pisces have trouble dealing with large doses of reality, so you may have to be the more pragmatic and realistic part of the team. Reality bruises delicate Pisces, so they will spread a thin veil of love around both of you for protection. The world you enter will be more beautiful than any you have ever seen.</p>
<p>This is true, blissful love, and you and your Pisces will protect, nurture, and strengthen the bonds that hold you close.</p>
