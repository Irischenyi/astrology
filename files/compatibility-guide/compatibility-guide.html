<h1>compatibility-guide<h1>

	    	<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your Sun sign can provide a great deal of information about how you relate to others. It is fun finding out how much you can learn about yourself AND your partner by reading this guide. Susan wrote every word, and the entire guide comprises 65,000 words.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Astrology is not destiny, so while the two of you might not be a classic match in astrological terms, you both can still find a way to get along quite beautifully by understanding each other&#8217;s needs and personality traits. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To use the compatibility guide, choose your sign and then enter the sign of your partner, friend, or business associate (ignoring the romantic references for all except your romantic relationship). You&#8217;ll receive a free, detailed analysis personally written by Susan about how the two of you are likely to get along. You will learn the areas you have in common and areas that might bring a challenge or two. Susan feels strongly that all people can relate well with each other, for there are no bad pairings. For some of your relationships, you may have to work a little harder, but in putting in the effort, you may be creating the strong glue that holds you together—and you both may have fun working on the relationship in the process. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you know your rising sign, by all means, read the report for that sign as well. For example, if you are a Pisces with Gemini rising, and your friend is a Cancer with Libra rising, read for the compatibility of Pisces with Cancer, and Gemini with Cancer (these two examples would relate to you), and then read Libra with Pisces and Libra with Gemini, so that this time you would get a perspective from the other person&#8217;s point of view. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you would like to know your rising sign, Susan can analyze your chart and explain it to you in easy to understand terms. For information, see <a href="http://www.MyPersonalHoroscope.com"><span class="s2">www.MyPersonalHoroscope.com</span></a></span></p>
