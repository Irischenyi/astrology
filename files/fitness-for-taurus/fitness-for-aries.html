	    	<p><strong>Your Ruling Planet:</strong> Aries is ruled by <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-planets/mars/">Mars</a>, the planet of strength and aggression.</p>
<p><strong>The Part Of The Body Your Sign Rules:</strong> Aries rules the head.</p>
<p><strong>Your Metabolism:</strong> Very high.</p>
<p><strong>Your Health Profile:</strong></p>
<p>You are an enthusiastic bundle of high energy. You work hard, and play even harder. Temperance is not your middle name! You do everything with gusto: eating, playing squash, making love. You always &#8220;live in the moment&#8221; and have strong faith in your future.</p>
<p>Yet as an Aries, you lack patience. You look for quick results in all things, including exercise and diet. The human body doesn&#8217;t always work on your timeline, so you may have to get used to nature&#8217;s slower pace. Luckily, you won&#8217;t likely have a problem with weight gain, since Aries is always on the go.</p>
<p>You excel at strenuous team sports and exercise regimens, because your ruling planet Mars &#8220;the warrior,&#8221; imparts to you awesome strength, endurance, confidence and drive. Highly competitive, Aries can also outlast any opponent out of sheer determination. Highly goal-oriented, Aries wants to win and does!</p>
<p>Strenuous activity calms you down, so you feel wonderful after a good workout. Try vigorous sports such as martial arts, wind surfing, rollerblading, football, softball, basketball, gymnastics, boxing, jumping rope. Mars rules iron, so try weight lifting or fencing too.</p>
<p>Aries can overheat, so keep drinking water. In foods, Aries loves hot and spicy, so stock up on some delicious salsa to add zest to broiled chicken or fish.</p>
<p>You could experience headaches from tension. Important: since your teeth are in your head, the part of the body ruled by your sign, watch your teeth as a source of pain and see your dentist on a regular basis!</p>
<p><strong>Your Biggest Asset:</strong></p>
<p>Enthusiasm and the vitality of the Energizer bunny.</p>
<p><strong>What Drives You Crazy:</strong> Not enough stimulation: &#8220;I&#8217;m bored!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Health Risks:</strong> Doing too much and not knowing your limit.</p>
