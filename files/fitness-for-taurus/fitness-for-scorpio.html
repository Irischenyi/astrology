<p class="text">Intense, driven and often secretive, Scorpio needs an outlet for your powerful emotions more than any other sign. You can be obsessive, and have an &#8220;all or nothing&#8221; determination about whatever you do. When Scorpios decide to diet, they can go overboard. This can be harmful if it leads to yo-yo dieting or an eating disorder. Still, whatever a Scorpio puts their mind to, they usually accomplish.</p>
<p class="text">You&#8217;ll need be smart about channelling any pent-up frustrations into healthy, stress-relieving activities. Boxing, long-distance running or a fast game of squash (any strenuous sport is good) could help you use up all that energy and stress before it starts to hurt you. Although your sign is highly competitive, you prefers to be alone when trying to unwind. The term &#8220;personal best&#8221; had to be coined by a loner Scorpio. Scorpio usually does not like to work out in teams or groups. Try the Stairmaster, weight lifting (Mars governs iron), or gymnastics. Slow jogging, or yoga combined with meditation are good ways to get the kinks out. Of course, the fact that exercise is good for your sex life should be a big motivating factor for any hot-blooded Scorpio!</p>
<p class="text">Realize that Scorpio rules the reproduction organs and a Scorpio without physical affection will soon feel sad or lonely. If your sex life is less than ideal, talk things out with your sweetheart, or get some counseling. Everyone, not just sexy Scorpios should follow safe sex procedures&#8211;not only to avoid AIDS but for unintended pregnancy and any number of sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
<p class="text">You have a rich and varied emotional life to say the least! Be sure to share your problems with those close to you as soon as they occur (not months later, which is Scorpio&#8217;s tendency.) Realize that the demands you place on yourself are higher than those anyone else would impose on you. You continually try to pack as much as possible into every day. Take time to look around you once and awhile. Remember too that you can get to be obsessed with things; try for more balance.</p>
<p><span class="text"><strong>Your Biggest Asset:</strong></span></p>
<p class="text">Your unwavering determination and commitment to success in all things.</p>
<p><span class="text"><strong>What Drives You Crazy:</strong></span></p>
<p class="text">People who waste time socializing at the gym. You have no time for that&#8211;you&#8217;re going for the burn!</p>
<p><span class="text"><strong>Health Risks:</strong></span></p>
<p class="text">Don&#8217;t be so inflexible, dear Scorpio. Life often calls upon us to dump what we&#8217;re doing and go to Plan B.</p>
