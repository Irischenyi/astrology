        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p><strong>As you may know, I’ve had a severe eye infection since September. The infection is gone, and so is the inflammation, but I’m still dealing with debris in my eyes. As I heal, I should be fine by the time I begin writing your December forecast.</strong></p>
<p>You have worked hard this year, and chances are you are aching to get out of town. Late last month you experienced a friendly full moon eclipse in Taurus on October 28, a point when travel plans may have been set in motion. Whether your trip was short or long, you did have a chance to get out of town. All eclipses coincide with new or full moons and are highly powerful lunations—as if on steroids.</p>
<p>Last month’s October 28 eclipse fell in your third house, so you may have finished an important negotiation, agreement, or manuscript. You may be ready to launch your new app, a re-designed website, or your just-finished podcast series. That eclipse was all about communication. That full moon arrived with Jupiter, the good fortune planet, so news was likely very welcome.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>The theme of travel and communication (ninth house activities) continues at the new moon in Scorpio (not an eclipse), 21 degrees, on November 13, but the mood will change. Uranus in your third house of travel and agreements will oppose the transiting Sun, new moon, and Mars, setting up a somewhat jarring atmosphere for everyone, not just you, dear Pisces. Travel, especially distant journeys, may be difficult at this time, and because a new moon can project into the future, be sure your car is tuned up and in fine working condition before heading out. If traveling by air, have your luggage well labeled with Apple air tags tucked inside all your suitcases in case your luggage is lost.</p>
<p>A client who you work with regularly may decide to bow out, leaving a gap in your monthly work routine. With Uranus opposing Mars, you may have a large expense, or you could see your income wobble a little until you find a new client to fill the vacuum of the one who might leave. Throughout, keep your health strong, and if your doctor suggests you need vitamins, don’t forget to take them.</p>

        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>Difficulties could come up in any area ruled by your ninth house: the media, publishing, broadcasting, digital realm, your pursuit of higher education, or legal matters.</p>
<p>Mars will move into Sagittarius on November 24 and stay until January 4, making this year-end period your most important of 2023 for spectacular career progress. If you lose a client mid-month, don’t spend time worrying. During the coming weeks, you can get one that is far better.</p>
<p>At month’s end near the full moon November 27 in Gemini, 5 degrees, you will likely be surrounded with family. Some Pisces will move house or order last minute repairs and maintenance on their home before the holidays—it will feel good to be ready.</p>
<p>You might be entertaining in your home—having family and friends at your place for a celebration—and some family members may even stay over for a few days. At some point, one woman family member might be critical of you, but you’ll be able to shrug those comments off with a smile—this full moon is basically a happy one, and almost nothing can poke a pin in your buoyant spirits.</p>
