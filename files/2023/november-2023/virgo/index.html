        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p><strong>As you may know, I’ve had a severe eye infection since September. The infection is gone, and so is the inflammation, but I’m still dealing with debris in my eyes. As I heal, I should be fine by the time I begin writing your December forecast.</strong></p>
<p>A certain close relationship has been challenging lately, due to the position of Saturn. However, this month you have three planets sending golden rays to Saturn, indicating your natural gift of communication can come in very handy now. As a Virgo, you are ruled by the intellectual and articulate planet Mercury, the reason you excel in choosing words that have just the right tone to convey your true feelings.</p>
<p>You experienced two eclipses last month—a new moon solar eclipse in your financial second house of salary (October 14), which may have brought you a new source of earned income or a valuable gift. The other one arrived October 28 as a lunar full moon eclipse in Taurus, your ninth house of distant travel, higher education, the media, and the court system.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>One of these areas of your ninth house lit up for you in a positive way. You might be celebrating a recent story that you wrote (or that was about you), as one example, or you may be coming home—or soon will in the first three days of November—from a major trip to an international city, as another. Whatever came up or will come up seems to have pleased you.</p>
<p>The coming new moon November 13 (not an eclipse) in Scorpio, 21 degrees, will be less smooth. This new moon appears in your third house, which rules communication. You might open labor negotiations, need to write or sign a contract, begin a book manuscript, send an important query letter, compose a scientific white paper, be assigned to do major medical research to publish for peer review, create an opening statement for a courtroom case, or work on a documentary or screenplay. You might decide to create a collection of poetry. You can decide on the area that excites you the most, of course—these are just a few examples.</p>
<blockquote><p>Put a gold star on November 27, the full moon that will light your prestigious tenth house of career, honors, awards, and achievement.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>Yet there will be tension in the air—it could be you want to take the project in one direction, but your client wants to go in a different direction. This difference of opinion will come up unexpectedly, and it may knock you sideways for a minute until you get your bearings. This new moon is in water-sign Scorpio, a sign that blends well with yours, so you can find an answer. Fortunately, as a Virgo, you are naturally realistic, practical, and cool under pressure, and those qualities will allow you to handle the situation while you think and keep things under control. You can find the right approach or response.</p>
<p>The month will end on a full moon November 27 in Gemini, 5 degrees, a very big moment for you, for it will light your prestigious tenth house of career, honors, awards, and achievement. You may get a promotion or an offer from a competitive firm. You may get admirable publicity in the press. It could easily turn out to be a time of reward that will put a gold star on this date (plus five days as the full moon wanes) that brings feelings of enormous pride. Powerhouse Pluto will be directly in touch with that full moon, heaping more benefits on you, and many of them will stem from the imagination and originality you have shown in your approach to your work. What a way to end the month!</p>
