        <p><strong>As you may know, I’ve had a severe eye infection since September. The infection is gone, and so is the inflammation, but I’m still dealing with debris in my eyes. As I heal, I should be fine by the time I begin writing your December forecast.</strong></p>
<p>You are thoughtful as you enter November. You just went through a full moon lunar eclipse in Taurus, 5 degrees, last month on October 28. If your birthday falls within five days of April 24 (or you have a Taurus ascendant at 5 degrees, plus or minus five degrees), you felt this eclipse more directly than your friends who were born at different points of the sign. All members of Taurus should have found something to celebrate on that October 28 eclipse.</p>
<p>Jupiter, the giver of gifts luck, was conjunct that moon, so you may have received a large sum of money or signed paperwork that will lead you to money soon. This eclipse will also put you in touch with your own needs and to think about what will make you truly happy. As we grow, our priorities are likely to change, so take some “me time” to think about how your life is proceeding.</p>
<p>The Scorpio new moon (not an eclipse) at 21 degrees on November 13 (plus two weeks) will be different and somewhat difficult, and you need to prepare for it. Keep your calendar light, and don’t schedule too many meetings or events. Many planets are stacking up in Scorpio, putting the focus on a partner in love or business. News may emanate from the person you are dating, feel you love, and hope to marry. Alternatively, you may be focused on your spouse if you are already married.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>Instead, this could be about your close partner or expert collaborator in business—your client, lawyer, accountant, business partner, agent, or social media director. Or the person may be a from your personal life, such as a home contractor, housekeeper, or wedding planner as some examples. Regardless of what area of your life this person emanates from, there would be a confidentiality inherent in the relationship. However, it may be that a competitor or rival appears unexpectedly. Something about a relationship or competitor is about to bring unwanted news, and you will have no warning. Indeed, there is an element of shock about this new moon, and it will take time for you to sort out what you want to do.</p>
<p>Uranus opposed to the Sun, new moon, and warrior Mars is a jarring aspect happening on the new moon November 13, and you would get news in the week that follows. The fact that Mars will be precisely opposed to unpredictable, unstable Uranus often can be explosive and may cause an irrevocable split and, depending on what you uncover, leave an emotional scar from the experience.</p>
<p>Those Taurus born on or within five days of May 11 will be the most likely to notice this new moon.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mercury will be the planet that reveals the final resolve to this full moon November 27, and with Venus beaming Mercury sweet vibrations, it appears you will like the outcome.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>This is a hot aspect due November 13, so you will need to keep things calm—don’t kick the hornet’s nest. If you look for trouble (such as to spark an argument), you will find it, and later might wish you had remained silent. Choose another time to approach a touchy subject, far from this date.</p>
<p>Two weeks later at the full moon of November 27, 5 degrees Gemini, you may be reorganizing money matters. This will not take long. With Pluto so supportive, this examination of your finances may be set off by a large sum you’re sent, so you may be thinking about how and where to best invest or save the funds. Consult your financial advisor for ideas, and work out a plan together.</p>
<p>Mercury will be the planet that reveals the final resolve to this full moon November 27, and with Venus beaming Mercury sweet vibrations, it appears you will like the outcome. After you invest, you may keep a little extra to spend on holiday gifts. Shop early—Mercury will retrograde on December 13 until January 1. By shopping early, you will avoid hearing that your favorite item is out of stock—inventory will be low this year. Capture those perfect gifts before someone else snaps them up!</p>
