        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p><strong>As you may know, I’ve had a severe eye infection since September. The infection is gone, and so is the inflammation, but I’m still dealing with debris in my eyes. As I heal, I should be fine by the time I begin writing your December forecast.</strong></p>
<p>This month will center on one or more of your friends and also on your love life. Just a few days ago, last month on October 28, you came through a full moon lunar eclipse in Taurus. It lit your romantic sector, so you may have met someone new and fascinating, or if you are attached, you may have seen your relationship go to a new level. If you didn’t meet anyone new, you still might during the first three or four days of November.</p>
<p>The place of the meeting would most likely have been (or will be) a party or a gathering of friends. You might have a fateful meeting at a convention devoted to a topic you enjoy, but it’s not likely you would meet a romantic interest at your office. The meeting might also stem from a blind date. One other possibility is that you met (or will meet) your one truelove on a vacation. A lot depends on your individual chart, but I can say if you are in a relaxed setting and having fun, a fateful meeting could occur.</p>
<p>If you are attached, Jupiter, which was conjunct the full moon eclipse October 28—a rare and glorious configuration—tied love (fifth house) directly to marriage (seventh house). Your steady partner or spouse may have had, or soon will have, a thrilling surprise for you. In fact, you may have given or accepted a proposal at the end of October, and that theme continues into very early November.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>No matter what your status, Venus played the most important role at the October 28 eclipse. As luck would have it, Venus received a joyful, electric beam from Uranus, the planet of surprise. It is in this wonderful state of mind that you enter November.</p>
<p>The first two weeks will go well, but by the new moon of November 13 in Scorpio, 21 degrees, the winds begin to blow in a different direction. The emphasis will still be on your social life but will suddenly draw your attention more strongly to one friend or to your membership in an association. Uranus will oppose the Sun, new moon, and Mars in an angry aspect on November 13, a hot aspect that may raise your ire when you hear a friend’s comments either directly or as conveyed to you through another friend.</p>
<p>This is complicated because your friend’s possible betrayal seems to impinge on or cause fallout on several areas of your life by creating this chaotic episode—your finances, your home life, and the opinion of your spouse or steady sweetheart will all be drawn into the conversation. Uranus in opposition to these three celestial bodies will be felt by everyone of every sign in all sorts of different ways.</p>
<blockquote><p>The full moon November 27 has strong support from Pluto, allowing you to defy gravity and soar above the heavy demands on your time. You will show others how a professional like you can get it all done.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>After November 13 people around you at work and at home will be acting and feeling fragile, so don’t add more pressure. For you, the realization that your friend (or group) could be critical or disloyal or behave in a hurtful manner toward you will be troubling. The incident could easily cause a painful scar of disbelief within you, along with your need to quickly end the relationship.</p>
<p>Neptune, watching what is going on, will attempt to help by giving you inspiration to come up with untried, new ideas. If the relationship means something to you, and you feel you can reason with your friend, Neptune will open the door for the two of you to talk in an attempt to save the relationship. Gentle Venus will work with Mercury at this time to help you find all the right words.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on your health, as you may feel drained by this event. By the full moon November 27 in Gemini, 5 degrees, Saturn will press hard on the Sun and full moon, forcing you to focus on the job at hand. Indeed, you’ll be busy at work, which could make you feel overwhelmed with too much to do and too little time. Yet this full moon has strong support from Pluto in Capricorn, allowing you to defy gravity and soar above the heavy demands on your time. You will show others how a professional like you can get it all done. It may appear to others that you are a magician, pulling a rabbit out of a hat, but you know the correct term is simply “talent.”</p>
