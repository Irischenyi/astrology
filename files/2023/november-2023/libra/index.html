        <p><strong>As you may know, I’ve had a severe eye infection since September. The infection is gone, and so is the inflammation, but I’m still dealing with debris in my eyes. As I heal, I should be fine by the time I begin writing your December forecast.</strong></p>
<p>This is a month largely about money—investing money, spending money, paying off debts, and most importantly, finding ways to make appreciably more money. This theme first started with the full moon lunar eclipse in Taurus on October 28, which lit your eighth house of other people’s money. You may have received news about taxes owed, a loan come due, or an expense you had not planned for but must pay. If none of this happened in late October, you may still hear something during the first several days of November. Don’t be concerned in early November, though, for a windfall may be on the way.</p>
<p>You may just have received a bonus, inheritance, prize, or large check owed to you, or soon will. If you have been negotiating the fair division of property in a divorce or in court over a financial matter, a verdict could come down favoring you. The October 28 eclipse may have brought a final settlement, or will in early November. With Jupiter conjunct that full moon, the amount could be more than you estimated would be awarded to you. The moon in Libra’s chart is tied directly to your career, however, so it might be you landed a new, better paying job, or will soon.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>Money will continue to consume your thinking at the new moon November 13 in Scorpio, 21 degrees, but this new moon, although not an eclipse, will be troublesome. Uranus will oppose the Sun, new moon, and Mars all at once and have you scrambling to find more cash. This is a difficult new moon because you won’t get any warning that this situation is coming up. In fact, a complication will seem to come out of thin air.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may be tearing away from a job you’ve held for a long time to take a new one. Or you may make a surprise announcement that you are quitting your job and starting your own business, a process that you have likely been working toward for months. The are other possibilities. Uranus works in strange, weird, and unexpected ways. A computer glitch may create havoc with your financials, so be sure all your software is up to date and that you have backed up your computer.</p>
<p>There is yet another possibility. You may assume a hacker would never hit you with identity theft, but it could happen, so scrutinize your bank and credit card records, and get a copy of all credit reporting agency reports on you to check for errors or outright fraud.</p>
<blockquote><p>You will get a chance to take a break and leave town within plus or minus five days of the full moon, November 27.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>Do not make agreements or sign papers for any financial deals in November if you can avoid doing so. The atmosphere is highly volatile—late November or early December will be a better time to take action on key projects or plans.</p>
<p>For at least 10 days following November 13, the air will be filled with cosmic dust, and it will be nearly impossible to see the road ahead. You will need to judge the risk-reward ratio of any financial decision, but mid-month will not yield reliable projections. Mars’ position in Scorpio (October 11 to November 24) can bring high expenses to you. Although determined to increase your income, in mid-November you will have to go slowly and carefully. Dealing intensely with financials can be exhausting, for there are plenty of details to go over, all quite necessary.</p>
<p>You will get a chance to take a break and leave town within plus or minus five days of the full moon, November 27. You might even take a close female friend or family member with you. You seem to want to get some exercise, so look for a resort or place nearby that would allow you to enjoy your favorite sports. By doing so you will work off any tensions you experienced earlier.</p>
<p>At this full moon in Gemini, 5 degrees, Mars will be conjunct the Sun, giving you over-the-top energy, and Mars in Sagittarius will oppose the full moon, suggesting the person traveling with you might be a bit critical or too blunt about you in their comments to you. Even so, you seem so glad to get away that you will let those comments roll off your little feathers. Breathe in the fresh air, dear Libra. December will bring happy festivities.</p>
