        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p><strong>As you may know, I’ve had a severe eye infection since September. The infection is gone, and so is the inflammation, but I’m still dealing with debris in my eyes. As I heal, I should be fine by the time I begin writing your December forecast.</strong></p>
<p>OK, let’s fully admit not every month is easy. You have walked the gauntlet for two years, with one eclipse after another, many of them challenging you to uproot your life and make adjustments. It all started with the solar eclipse in Taurus that arrived on November 19, 2021. Others came by every six months in pairs in Scorpio and your opposite sign of Taurus. Look back and you will see your life has changed quite a bit since that first eclipse in November 2021. Typically, we experience four eclipses a year, and the job of an eclipse is to create rapid and dramatic change.</p>
<p>At the end of last month, October 28, you experienced a full moon lunar eclipse in your opposite sign of Taurus. It marked the very last eclipse in the Scorpio-Taurus series, and there will be no more eclipses in these signs for nine years. That October 28 eclipse was an anomaly in this entire series of eclipses for it was a friendly eclipse, orbiting tightly with Jupiter, the good fortune planet.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>As you enter November, you may still be thinking about your romantic or serious, committed partner, for that person was the subject of the eclipse. In your personal life, that person might be your steady sweetheart, who you hope to marry, or your present spouse. In a different manifestation, the eclipse may have had you focused on a close business partner, agent, publicist, social media manager, event planner, interior designer, or other expert, and you were to see a development with that person.</p>
<p>You may have decided to marry your sweetheart, or if you are already married, to make more of your marriage and tackle a new life chapter together. If the partner is one for business, you may have received benefits from your partner who has clearly been looking out for your interests.</p>
<p>The new moon this month on November 13 (not an eclipse) will be in Scorpio, 21 degrees, and Uranus is about to throw a monkey wrench into the works. In the days and weeks that follow the appearance of that new moon, you may discover news about a partner that may throw you off course will have to make a decision about what you need in a partner—at work or in your personal life—in order to be happy and content.</p>
<blockquote><p>The new moon November 13 will help you sort out who you should and should not align with. Always be glad to have truth.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>You are tired of these kinds of out-of-the-blue shocks. Uranus happens to be in a tough position but is steadily moving away from the hard place it has been positioned toward you. Have faith—this new moon will help you sort out who you should and should not align with. Sometimes when a relationship has become unhappy, unproductive, or even toxic, the universe has to step in to break the chain of events, reveal necessary information, and bring enlightenment. Always be glad to have truth.</p>
<p>Uranus in opposition (November 13) to the Sun, new moon, and Mars is a strong aspect and can leave a scar from what is learned, usually accidentally (but not always) and subsequently can trigger a tearing away from a relationship. The Sun rules your career, so this seems more likely to be linked to a business expert or collaborator, or even a competitor.</p>
<p>The end of the month improves your outlook. The full moon in Gemini on November 27 at 5 degrees will focus on money and joint financial matters. If you are leaving your spouse, or departing from a business collaborator or expert, you may be discussing the division of assets in a final agreement or settlement. If your mate or business partner ran up expenses and is drawing money from your shared resources, and you knew nothing about it, you will now.</p>
<p>If your business partner embezzled funds from your business or is demanding money for bogus reasons, you will likely have to consult a lawyer. I am sorry to have to suggest such possibilities, but this is a severe aspect. Saturn will be in hard angle to Mars, the Sun, and the full moon, so it appears your main priority will be your children and their care at this full moon. Pluto, your ruler, will secure the situation from his position at the very bottom of your chart—this means your home and family will be protected.</p>
