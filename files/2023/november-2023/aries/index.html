        <p><strong>As you may know, I’ve had a severe eye infection since September. The infection is gone, and so is the inflammation, but I’m still dealing with debris in my eyes. As I heal, I should be fine by the time I begin writing your December forecast.</strong></p>
<p>As you enter November, you might still be thinking about the full moon eclipse in Taurus that affected you financially on October 28, plus five days. Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, arrived conjunct that eclipse. Eclipses are among the most powerful aspects the universe uses to effect change, and Jupiter is one of the best aspects you could ever wish to see, so you must have been pleased with the news. The matter may have something to do with changes in the source of your salary or a financial negotiation you are about to finish, perhaps regarding an impending divorce, where you are working to settle the fair division of property accrued during the marriage.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may be excited about having sold real estate or by the purchase of a house. Or you may be moving into a new apartment. With Jupiter conjunct that full moon, you should be exceedingly happy with the way things will turn out. Additionally, Venus will receive shimmering rays from surprise planet Uranus (and in your chart, Venus rules your finances), so you may see a fortunate, last-minute twist that talks unexpectedly take—and more money, possibly a windfall, finds its way to you. Neptune is opposing Venus, however, meaning there are details that are still unclear, so ask questions, and have a lawyer help you with the paperwork.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>You will continue to focus on your financials at the November 13 new moon in Scorpio, 21 degrees (not an eclipse), but due to Uranus in a cranky mood at this new moon, a stressful episode may result, again focused on money. Uranus, which had been friendly on the eclipse of October 28, will be difficult at this new moon and send a rattling development regarding your home or living condition, finances, or even possibly regarding a love relationship.</p>
<p>You may find out you have to pay a large sum to cover an expense you won’t see coming. Alternatively, an investment may go wrong, or you may discover that an insurance policy will not cover everything you thought it would. On the other hand, company benefits at work may have changed, and not in a good way. The news could be nerve-jangling (all zodiac signs are in the same boat), but you do have some friendly planets on your side.</p>
<p>Pluto and Mars will be involved at this tough new moon November 13. Both planets will be friendly to each other and to the new moon (wide at 8 degrees), suggesting there is a workable solution if you look for it.</p>
<blockquote><p>You will have the urge to get on the road to travel and see something new near the full moon November 27.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>Mars and Pluto will both play a large role at this new moon, but while Mars is stirring the pot by spicing things up, Pluto will be in (wide) friendly comforting aspect to the trio in Scorpio: the Sun, new moon, and Mars. If a person who is important to you brings you some unnerving news, Pluto will give you a chance to talk together a day or two afterwards. Talking out your feelings might be a good idea.</p>
<p>Your mind will be hungry for stimulation, and by November 24, Saturn wild be in hard angle to the coming full moon and Sun. Mars, your ruler, will be in travel sign Sagittarius, so you will be motivated to stay late at the office and finish things up in order for you to go.</p>
<p>You will have the urge to get on the road to travel and see something new near the full moon in Gemini which occurs Monday, November 27 at 5 degrees. It may be that you’ll leave a few days before this date and be back home from your happy trip on or just after this full moon. If you’re in the US, you might be traveling due to the Thanksgiving holiday.</p>
<p>Neptune, which can make any situation fuzzy, will be in hard angle to the full moon, so if you do travel, make sure you have the correct address of your destination, and double-check that the accommodations are secure and held for you—no matter how late you might arrive. Have your car tuned up, if that’s your preferred method of transportation.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>Some Aries may say it is too hard to pull away to travel—there are people depending on you, so it appears that unfinished work will weigh on your shoulders. If you simply can’t travel, investigate ways to bring something new into your life—a museum exhibit, book signing, or tickets to a play or a movie debut.</p>
<p>On the plus side, Mercury will be the most important planet at this full moon and will be in contact with gracious Venus, so whatever happens over this full moon will bring you a touch of happiness.</p>
<p>The area of your chart that the full moon will illuminate, the third house, rules communication, so you may also finish up a manuscript, speech, podcast series, research paper, newsworthy documentary, or journalistic newspaper story, or you could see your major cover story published in a magazine.</p>
<p>Do your best to do something fun, dear Aries—you need the change of scene, even if it is only for a few days.</p>
