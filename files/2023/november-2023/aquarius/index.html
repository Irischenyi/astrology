        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p><strong>As you may know, I’ve had a severe eye infection since September. The infection is gone, and so is the inflammation, but I’m still dealing with debris in my eyes. As I heal, I should be fine by the time I begin writing your December forecast.</strong></p>
<p>This month could be a turning point, for the main energy of the planets will cut across the top and bottom of your chart, emphasizing key areas of your life: your home and family at one point, and your career and public image will be accented on the other.</p>
<p>The planets have strongly spotlighted the benefit to you of devoting time and energy to improving the stylishness and comfort of your physical home. To that end, you may renovate, redecorate, or simply do a thorough cleaning and make repairs. You may have purchased property or rented your first apartment or vacation cottage, but no matter what you did, you had every chance to make your home(s) your castle. Good-fortune Jupiter is currently in your home and family sector and will remain in this part of your chart until May 25, 2024, so you have plenty of time to devote to any plan—or to realize a wish—you have regarding your home or other property. If you bought extra property to rent out, such as through Airbnb, you could be in line to make quite a profit (or soon will) because Jupiter is not only tied to happiness in a chart but also financial gain.</p>
<p>Included in this trend is the joy you would likely feel when you devote time to and strengthen your bonds with family. Doing so would bring you an enormous feeling of warmth and closeness. You would enjoy strong family support back, too—your family apparently loves your ideas and will encourage you to go after your dream. A family member might give you tips, an introduction, or contribute funds too, to help you reach your goal.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>All these concepts were coming to the surface late last month on the full moon lunar eclipse of October 28 in Taurus. Something was coming to a crest or finish, and as you enter November, you may still be thinking about events that occurred.</p>
<p>The first two weeks of November will be quiet, and you will be able to follow your own agenda. However, the mood will change after the new moon November 13 in Scorpio, 21 degrees. Your attention will switch to your career, for that new moon is about to appear at the pinnacle of your chart. If you are not in the work force, you may be doing important humanitarian or community work that will draw positive acclaim and, in weeks to come, give you the chance to raise your public image.</p>
<p>However, Uranus, your ruling planet, will simultaneously oppose the Sun, new moon, and Mars—a jarring aspect. Something going on at home unexpectedly will require you switch your attention to there. It could be that your home loses all its electrical power or that something goes wrong with a computer or digital device that you urgently need to do your work. Many people work from home in a hybrid situation (working part of the time at the office, part of the time at home), and you might, too. If so, you would need Wi-Fi to do your job, and your family or roommate would need it for other reasons.</p>
<blockquote><p>Within four days of the November 27 full moon, carve out quality time with the one you love or, if not attached, plan a fun, surprise outing for little ones close to you that will be remembered forever.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>Uranus rules electricity, but it could have other spillover effects as well. A family member such as your parent, spouse, or child, might need your instant, focused attention. You may unexpectedly be pulled away from your meetings and other events scheduled at the office, and this will happen at a time when your career is doing well. Don’t worry—few things could possibly stop your career progress. Attend to those dear to you who need and depend on your care. This new moon will test the resourcefulness, adaptability, and agility of everyone of every sign, each in different ways.</p>
<p>As you get closer to month’s end, you will encounter a compatible full moon in Gemini, 5 degrees, set to light your house of true love. You will want to take time out to relax near this full moon and will want to find an attractive travel package, although you may be sensitive to costs. You might be traveling with a friend who has a big event that she’d like you to attend.</p>
<p>If you can’t travel out of town, you still could have a highly romantic episode either two days prior to November 27 or within five days after. At the very least, carve out quality time with the one you love. If you are not attached, plan a fun, surprise outing for your children or any children close to you that all of you will remember forever.</p>
