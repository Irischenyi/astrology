        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p><strong>As you may know, I’ve had a severe eye infection since September. The infection is gone, and so is the inflammation, but I’m still dealing with debris in my eyes. As I heal, I should be fine by the time I begin writing your December forecast.</strong></p>
<p>Work is humming along well, and judging by the news of last month’s full moon lunar eclipse in Taurus, your sixth house of assignments, on October 28, you seem to be finishing up a large, major project. The moon in your chart is linked to your financial eighth house, and good-fortune Jupiter arrived shoulder-to-shoulder with that full moon eclipse, indicating generous money is likely to arrive (if it has not already). The money will stem from your eighth house of other people’s money, so the money would likely be unrelated to your regular salary and likely come in the form of a court settlement, insurance claim payment, inheritance, large sale of property, bank loan, or other source.</p>
<p>Yet not everything will be as it appears. You seem to have an envious person near you who you trust but who would be willing to do anything to steal your thunder. This person is not conducting his or her scheme in the open but from the shadows (twelfth house, an area of the chart that the ancients wrote is the place of “secret enemies”). It’s rare to have this type of situation activated, but this is a possibility in the days and weeks following the November 13 new moon in Scorpio, 21 degrees, so stay alert.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>This person may try to use computer or digital media (Uranus’ domain) to take credit for your work or to attack your reputation. Or this person may simply want to steal your time by distracting you with digital attacks and hacks. At the new moon of November 13 and the two weeks that follow, this person will begin to reveal his plan, but not his identity.</p>
<p>Jupiter will protect your project and reputation, so you would have no reason to worry excessively, but you will have to figure out the identity of this person and their methods and motivations. You will want justice, and you can get it—but that will take time. Neptune, the planet of haze and mist, is well aspected to this new moon, so truth will eventually surface, and with Pluto an ally to you too, you have help. Pluto will coax you to doggedly follow the breadcrumbs to whomever and wherever they lead. The main point is, this desperate person’s antics will be proven pathetic and not be taken seriously. This entire episode will be reduced to a nuisance, but you will have to be part of the solution to finish it off.</p>
<blockquote><p>The full moon of November 27 will put a brilliant spotlight on your partnership in love (spouse, steady sweetheart) or in business with a collaborator or expert.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>The full moon of November 27 is interesting. It falls in your opposite sign of Gemini at 5 degrees, and it may be then that you will get a final resolve to the mystery that started November 13. A full moon brings information to light, and Mars will move out of his behind-the-scenes placement to put you in control. This is because Mars will move into Sagittarius on November 24 and stay until January 4, 2024, giving you rare power, influence, and clout. Mars comes to your sign every two years, so you will enter one of the most important periods of 2023 at this time.</p>
<p>Also, starting November 22, the Sun will exit your weak twelfth house and enter your strong first house of personality. The Sun will accompany Mars into Sagittarius. In all ways, things will improve quite a bit by the full moon of November 27. At the same time, Saturn will be in hard angle to the full moon in Gemini and the Sun in Sagittarius, but it will give you the impetus to stabilize people you align with, so you appear open to joining forces with another person who is important to you. As a Sagittarius, you are not one to be eager to make a commitment in love or business, but this time is different.</p>
<p>In that respect, this full moon of November 27 will also put a brilliant spotlight on your partnership in love (spouse, steady sweetheart) or in business with a collaborator or expert you will hire or have hired some time ago. You may get engaged or marry, or you may hire a new accountant, lawyer, doctor, agent, or other special expert. It’s a good time to do so.</p>
