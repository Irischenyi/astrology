        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p><strong>As you may know, I’ve had a severe eye infection since September. The infection is gone, and so is the inflammation, but I’m still dealing with debris in my eyes. As I heal, I should be fine by the time I begin writing your December forecast.</strong></p>
<p>As you enter November, you may be attending to health matters, for a lunar eclipse—a friendly one—arrived in your sixth house of health on October 28. This was a full moon and may have put you in touch with medical personnel. A full moon like this one will coax you to get all the screenings and tests done you know you should have but that you always say you cannot find the time to do. Now is the time to stop and attend to those matters. See your eye doctor for an exam, and your dentist for a checkup, too.</p>
<p>Things tend not to linger at a full moon eclipse—you get things done and move on. That full moon eclipse appeared with Jupiter, the great healer, so if you found you need a procedure or consultation with a specialist (or will in early November), you have every reason to be optimistic. At the same time—late last month or early November, as a piece of side news—you may receive a check or gift. It seems to stem from a partner or a client you are working with closely.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>A troublesome new moon (but not an eclipse) is due to arrive on November 13 in Scorpio, 21 degrees, drawing your attention to work and to the individuals, or a single member of your team, who report to you. You will be busy with tasks to complete, and you will need all hands on deck, but it seems that some of your subordinates may not get along with each other, forcing you into the role of mediator. Alternatively, someone may make an error that has to be corrected, for if it is not, things could go haywire.</p>
<p>In the weeks that follow November 13, you will need to be present on the job—in the office, not on a business trip or holiday—so you can run interference and, if necessary, save the day.</p>
<p>Taskmaster Saturn will be in hard angle to your ruler Mercury, so if someone who reports to you quits, you will have to take on more until you can hire a replacement. It looks like you will be very focused on all that happens on a current project, for you reputation will be at stake. Keep your health strong, for the new moon will put a strain on you. This difficult new moon will affect everyone, not just you, and people you speak to will be feeling more tense than usual—be kind.</p>
<blockquote><p>Venus will move into Libra from November 8 to December 4. This is a perfect place for Venus to be, for Venus will tour your fifth house of true love and fun.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>The full moon in Gemini, 5 degrees, on November 27 will bring something dearly important to you to fruition. It might involve travel or a creative communication project. Although your job is strenuous these days, you will have Pluto protecting you from a financial house, and there will be spots of fun, for Venus will move into Libra from November 8 to December 4. This is a perfect place for Venus to be, for Venus will tour your fifth house of true love and fun.</p>
<p>Mars, the action planet, will move into Sagittarius on November 24 and stay until January 4, so you may become very serious about the person you are dating. You both may be planning to get engaged for Christmas or New Year’s, and with the heavenly planets above acting like happy little relatives who will be encouraging you to wed, it could happen. If you are already married, you may make a promise to each other to work on a major life goal, such as to buy a house, have a baby, or start a business together—you can think of more examples. Next month, December, should be joyous.</p>
