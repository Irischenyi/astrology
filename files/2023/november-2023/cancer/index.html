        <p><strong>As you may know, I’ve had a severe eye infection since September. The infection is gone, and so is the inflammation, but I’m still dealing with debris in my eyes. As I heal, I should be fine by the time I begin writing your December forecast.</strong></p>
<p>You’ve been doing well in your career, so in November, it will be safe to turn away and devote a portion of quality time to your friendships and love life. Last month, you experienced a lunar eclipse on October 28, which may have brought you a festive social event within the week that the eclipse occurred. Jupiter arrived with the full moon, so the event must have been luxurious and quite beautiful. It would have been an event that drew many friendly, successful people together. The moon is your ruler, so lunar eclipses are more important to you than for any other sign.</p>
<p>Eclipses, which always fall on a new or full moon, typically happen four times a year. They act a little differently from normal new and full moons for they are powerful lunations and therefore have a much stronger influence. Most people notice an eclipse within five days after it appears. Sometimes, however, a full moon lunar eclipse will send its message one month before it appears or one month after it appears, plus or minus five days.</p>
<p>If you did not see a social event dot your calendar, you may still have one coming. Cancers born in June (rather than July) were most likely to feel that friendly eclipse. The event could have involved a friend, so perhaps you went to a friend’s wedding or attended an award ceremony in her honor. Sometimes an eclipse can “eclipse out” someone from your environment, so in that case, the event may have been bittersweet if, for instance, your friend is getting married and moving a great distance away. You will miss her. This scenario is less likely, and hopefully that won’t happen to you.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>The November 13 new moon in Scorpio at 21 degrees (not an eclipse) is more troubling, for unpredictable Uranus will directly oppose the Sun, new moon, and Mars, all circulating in your fifth house of true love. This is a volcanic aspect, and a separating one as well—something ends, and something else begins. If you are dating seriously, you may review your feelings about your partner due to an incident, comment you hear, or troubling point of view that your partner unexpectedly expresses. It would be a piece of information you wish you hadn’t heard. The practical side of you, however, will realize you are lucky you found out this information when you did. Having truth is always better.</p>
<p>If it is not your sweetheart who is the subject of this new moon, this same area of your chart rules your child, who may need help. For example, your son may be unhappy at school (perhaps he is being bullied by other kids, for example), and the school is doing nothing about it. This would mean you’d have little choice but to enlighten the principal or other authority figure, but with Mars opposed to Uranus, it will be hard to keep the conversation calm. If it becomes evident the authority figure at the school is clearly oblivious to the problem, you may decide to change schools.</p>

        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>There is another way this new moon could cause ripples in your emotions. It could involve a creative project you are involved in that is veering off course and ready to go off the rails. Perhaps a client wants a complete redo but is refusing to pay more. In this case, however, Neptune, the planet in charge of the arts and creativity, is in ideal angle to the Sun, new moon, and Mars, as well as to Uranus and Pluto. If this is how things work out, stay optimistic because there will be a solution to the problem that both you and the client would find agreeable.</p>
<p>You are fortunate because the new moon is in Scorpio, a water sign like yours. There is basic compatibility here, so you will likely be able to resolve any of the three possibilities presented.</p>
<p>By month’s end, you have a full moon in Gemini, 5 degrees, on November 27, and at that time, you will crave rest and privacy. Keep your strength up, however, as you are heading into a busy December. Mercury will begin to retrograde December 13 until January 1, but you will feel the slowdown that Mercury brings much sooner than December 13—more likely December 1. Start by making your list, and shop for the children in your family first. December will be joyous, so you will have a sparkling holiday in store.</p>
