        <p><strong>As you may know, I’ve had a severe eye infection since September. The infection is gone, and so is the inflammation, but I’m still dealing with debris in my eyes. As I heal, I should be fine by the time I begin writing your December forecast.</strong></p>
<p>You may be celebrating a victory in your career as a result of the full moon lunar eclipse that came by last month on October 28 in Taurus, for it lit up your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement. Even better, that full moon was conjunct Jupiter, the great planet of good fortune. Venus, at the time, was in your second house of salary in a favorable angle to your prestigious professional house, so you are likely to have received a generous salary increase.</p>
<p>If you say no, just the opposite happened—you lost your job—then wait and see how this works out, for you could soon turn the tables on that incident. You are about to be rewarded for your past work accomplishments, experience, and skills. Sometimes you have to be released from one situation to receive the glittering gifts the universe has reserved for you. Have faith in the wisdom of the universe and in your abilities, which (as seen in your chart) are clearly unique.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>On November 13, a new moon in Scorpio, 21 degrees, might bring tension in regard to home and family matters. This will not be an eclipse. The person you live with may be quietly envious of your career luck or frustrated at the many hours you need to spend at the office. Make an effort to show that person at home he or she is valued. Uranus in your career house will directly oppose the Sun, the new moon, and warrior Mars, all in Scorpio in your solar house of home. Brace for an unexpected event to occur with this person within a week after the new moon arrives November 13 because Leo, your sign, is a fixed sign, as is Scorpio, the sign of the new moon, so finding an answer to the situation will be challenging. Neither one of you will want to compromise. Listen to this person, and work to come up with an imaginative solution that suits you both—take your time, for there is no rush. For both you and this person at home you dearly care for, you will be motivated to get this right.</p>
<p>Another way this could work out would be with contractor or someone working on your house. You might get some unexpected news, or just disagree with a plan of action.</p>
<blockquote><p>November 24 will be the first time in two years that you will receive strong rays in matters of the heart from action-hero Mars—and Mars can work wonders.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>As you get to the end of the month, you will have a chance to shake off any tensions and enjoy a good time at a special event. It will draw many people, some of whom you’ll know and some you may not, but no matter—you will find the people open and interesting, and conversation will bubble up. This event will come as a result of the full moon in Gemini on November 27 at 5 degrees. It could be related to your career, such as a fun convention, or to your personal life, such as a wedding or beautiful birthday party of a friend, as just two of many possibilities.</p>
<p>Even if your event should be for work, your outlook for enjoying love and romance is excellent. Mars will have just entered compatible Sagittarius (November 24), your fifth house of true love and new love, and Mars will remain there until January 4. This is the first time in two years that you will receive strong rays in matters of the heart from action-hero Mars—and Mars can work wonders. This suggests you will have a very active, festive holiday season. Next month is due to be calmer and more spiritual than this one—the planets will cooperate in a way they won’t in mid-November, even though Mercury will be retrograde in December.</p>
<p>Shop and ship your gifts early, because Mercury will retrograde December 13 to January 1. You will feel the slowdown at the start of December in communication, transportation, the mail, and commerce, so if you start gearing up for the holidays now, you will have a very celebratory December.</p>
