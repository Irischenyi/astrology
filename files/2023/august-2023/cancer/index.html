        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>As you enter August, you will likely receive proof that your amazing professional momentum is still going strong. Mars, the planet that rules your solar career midheaven (the highest point in your chart), will receive golden beams from Jupiter, the planet of gifts and luck. VIPs will be singing your praises on August 1, and this date also coincides with a full moon, which makes this aspect bigger. If you need to ask for a favor or have something changed, do it in the first week of the month.</p>
<p>On August 1 you have a full moon in Aquarius, 9 degrees, which will light your eighth house of other people’s money. If you work on commission or royalty, you will likely receive a check within five days of this date. Any money owed to you would probably come in then, including child support, a repaid loan you made to a friend, or cash you are expecting for any other reason. You may be tweaking your retirement portfolio with the help of an advisor, making additions or changes to your will, drawing up a living trust, or deciding how to invest an inheritance.</p>
<p>Saturn will oppose Mercury, so you will be in a deeply thoughtful mood, careful to come to the most practical, realistic conclusions, which can be beneficial. Uranus will work closely with Pluto in a very rare aspect (these planets are within six degrees of each other now and will gradually draw closer to form a perfect trine in July 2026), so I feel you may have a generous sum to invest, save, or spend.</p>
<p>At the same time, Uranus, which will be the lead planet at the August 1 full moon, will be in hard angle to Venus. I feel you may have a home -or family-related expense arise out of the blue, and you will have the money to cover it. Of course, unexpected costs are not welcome, and you might feel squeezed for cash, however, I do see possibilities for you to have money coming in.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>Generally, August will be a slow month. Mercury, Venus, Saturn, Neptune, and Pluto will all be retrograde, and any planet retrograde is a weakened planet that does not allow access to its greatest powers. (Uranus will go retrograde at the end of August, and Jupiter will retrograde beginning September 4, so they’re both slowing down already.) Of the retrograde planets listed, the most important ones will be Venus and Mercury—these are the two planets that orbit closest to earth, and we feel them strongly when they’re out of phase.</p>
<p>The fact that life will slow down may be excellent news for you, because every so often, it’s nice to be able to work at a leisurely pace. While it is true you may have to field a number of postponements and cancellations, these will ultimately work to your benefit. It would be hard to make steady progress with a cosmic soup made with substandard vegetables.</p>
<p>Typically, when you begin a big project with Mercury retrograde, large parts of it would have to be redone later. For example, your game’s or website’s code or navigation might turn out to be faulty, or a contract may have to be renegotiated later. Mercury rules all intellectual things—facts and figures, transportation and the mail, and all communication. Mercury also rules electronics, so if you need to purchase or replace a device, do so in early August, or wait until the second half of September.</p>
<blockquote><p>The new moon August 16 has a varied outlook for financial news, but it will provide you with opportunities to kick back and have fun.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>With Venus retrograde, you may not like the look or style of the product or website you create, for example. If you have Botox or fillers, the same rule applies—Venus governs beauty and good looks, love, and money, and if you act now, you may not be happy with the results. If you want a radically new haircut or color, wait until after September 15 to schedule your new style. Since Venus rules love and affection, if you are single, do not start a new relationship until mid -to late September at the earliest.</p>
<p>You can save time, money, and energy by waiting to start anything important until after Venus goes direct on September 3 and Mercury goes direct on September 15. Sign paperwork after September 15.</p>
<p>I know we cannot control everything in life, so do your best to follow these suggestions. Under extreme conditions, you may not be able to. For example, if you are offered a great new job from a company you’ve never worked with before, you might have to take the role during Mercury retrograde or risk losing it. You may not like the position later, but you might want it on your résumé, and you can gain something of value in the time you are there.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to the new moon on August 16 in Leo, and like the earlier full moon on August 1 in Aquarius, this one will focus on money. The August 16 new moon is troublesome and will fall in your second house of personal earned income and possessions. The Sun rules your solar second house of money, so this is where all the action will be centered. Uranus, the planet of all unexpected developments, will severely challenge this new moon and the Sun, so again, another big expense could be on the way. (Stay with me, there is helpful news coming, too.)</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mars will receive confusing beams from Neptune, so it will be hard to sort out truth from fiction in August, especially regarding agreements and contractual matters. (As if Mercury retrograde from August 23 to September 15 would not be enough to create fog, Neptune will add more.) You will need to have a lawyer to make sure any contract you agree to will be clear and cover anything that might come up. You should wait to sign until next month, but you can show your lawyer your contract now, if you’d like.</p>
<p>There is a mitigating factor—Mars will be in a tight, gorgeous angle to Uranus on August 16, so this could mean that although you receive a large expense, other news that’s also happening in the days following August 16 could bring word of more money coming to you.</p>
<p>As you see, the universe is speaking in riddles. This often happens—you can receive untoward news one day, and a day or two later, you could get a really positive update unrelated to what came before. Mars (energy) in a harmonious trine with Uranus (surprise) is a great aspect. You won’t see the news coming—it will surprise you.</p>
<p>Mars is connected to your work and your professional reputation (the reason for your excellent financial luck—your previous great performance on the job). Uranus is connected to your financial house (the result here is more money through a commission, bonus, cash advance, residual, royalty, or one-time fee. Or you may receive help from a bank or venture capitalist.) Money appears to be on the way, dear Cancer.</p>
<p>At the same time as the new moon on August 16, you will be able to take little trips and see friends. Uranus and Jupiter will be beaming happy vibrations to Mercury and Mars, so you may revisit a place you’ve not seen in many years, perhaps as far back as childhood. If you have a sweetheart or a partner, you will find your one and only to be very congenial and willing to visit your friends, and everyone will mix well. As you see, although this new moon has a varied outlook for financial news, it will provide you with opportunities to kick back and have fun.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>During this unusual month, we have one additional full moon on August 30—called a blue moon—this time in Pisces, 7 degrees, filling your ninth house. This area of your chart covers foreign people and places, international travel and relationships, and immigration, along with matters involving passports, visas, and foreign residency matters.</p>
<p>If an immigration or citizenship matter comes up, this would not be the best time for a residency interview, as it could be tough. I don’t think you would be able to choose your interview date—you would have to meet at the time they give you. Considering how backlogged these appointments are due to the pandemic, you must take the date you are given. In that case, study up, and you will be ready for it.</p>
<p>This area of your chart, your ninth house, governs the information you take in and your pursuit of an advanced degree at a university or college. The ninth house also rules the information you disburse, so the media, publishing, and broadcasting are covered here as well. If you work in the media, you will likely be given a strenuous assignment, but this project could, nevertheless, become a jewel in your crown.</p>
<p>Saturn in Pisces at 3 degrees will be conjunct the full moon on August 30. This is a limiting influence, so I am wondering how you will react to this full moon. If you are doing business abroad, you may hear news that stops you in your tracks. You will need to consider how the dictate from your client or foreign office will affect you. It could be that someone either overseas or in your country wants you to take on a very weighty position. This would be doubly true if you work in the media (publishing or broadcasting).</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>I don’t want to overemphasize Saturn’s negative elements here because this can go either way, and a lot depends on how you have been doing in the weeks and months leading up to this point. Saturn can be a tough teacher, but at the same time, he is known to be fair. Some people need just a drop from Saturn, while others need quite a lot—Saturn will give only what you need. It is very possible you will be offered new responsibilities from a client or boss in an international or media context.</p>
<p>If you are a Cancer born June 21 to June 26, you will feel this full moon more than most. Cancer is ruled by the moon and will therefore feel Saturn’s conjunction to this full moon more powerfully than any other sign. At the same time, Saturn is in Pisces (3 degrees) and the full moon is also in Pisces (7 degrees), so we see here that Saturn is creating a beautiful trine to your natal Cancer Sun. This suggests that whatever comes up will have a long-range outcome and add to your feelings of future financial security.</p>
<p>I will admit you could have a problem with water at this time. The August 30 full moon will be in your travel house, so if you are traveling, drink bottled water. Keep track of weather reports, and pay attention to any warnings about sudden storms and the possibility of flash flooding. A car can be submerged or turn over quickly. As little as six inches of water can cause a car to stall, and just one foot of water can float your vehicle. If you go swimming, only swim in the ocean if a lifeguard is present. Read signs posted on the beach. Watch your children, and do not encourage them to dig deep into the sand lest they uncover a sinkhole.</p>
<p>I know, this is one of those months, not only for you, but for everyone. We all need to get through it, but you could find pockets that are quite special and joyful.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>It is time to sort out the facts and untangle a confusing financial situation. You can no longer say you aren’t adept at handling these kinds of financial matters—as a Cancer, you are known to be wise and careful with money, and it is just that life has brought you a number of unusual surprise developments that have required you to spend. These events have temporarily thrown you off course. You may not be satisfied with how much you have saved or invested, but you can now set yourself on a better course.</p>
<p>As you are ready and able, set aside money for yourself first before you pay bills each week because having Pluto in a rare, special angle to Uranus can help you amass wealth. Listen to your financial advisor’s recommendations, because if you do, you will enjoy a growing feeling of financial security. There are apps that allow you to save tiny amounts of money as frequently as you’d like, and these apps make saving easy. You might like one of them.</p>
<p>A special day to have an interview, make a presentation, or pitch new business will be August 1 when Mars in Virgo and Jupiter in Taurus will be perfectly aligned. On this day you will find there will be money to be made, and if you work on a commission or royalty basis, the sum could be impressive. A friend seems instrumental in your professional luck, so be open to a tip or an offer for an introduction.</p>
<p>With Uranus making a long journey through your friendship house, you will be meeting highly creative, powerful people who might also be interested in doing humanitarian work or finding ways to leave the world a better place than when they entered it.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>Moving ahead to the middle of the month, the new moon on August 16 might bring unwanted news about another financial matter, but it’s simply a challenge for you to be more organized, realistic, and resourceful. Stick to your goals, and keep working through any unexpected glitches. Normally, a new moon in your second house of earned income (which you’ll have at this time) would be a perfect point to ask for a raise, but considering all aspects, it seems you’d only manage to be approved for a small one, if you manage to get approved for a raise at all.</p>
<p>On August 16, the Sun and new moon will be in hard angle to unpredictable Uranus, a tough aspect, so don’t take a “no” personally. Your company may be streamlining salaries to conserve money. The answer you get seems like it won’t have to do with your performance but will instead be about the overall condition of the economy.</p>
<p>Although the first half of August will allow you to focus strongly on money, you will have a wonderful chance to travel to a lovely setting in the second half of the month. Thanks to a three-way collaboration involving Uranus, Mars, and Pluto, you may be working on a major deal before you go, one that would bring in considerable profits. However, Mercury will be retrograde from August 23 to September 15, and Venus, the planet that governs beauty, love, and money, will also be out of phase until September 3.</p>
<p>Do your best to delay talks until after you are back from vacation next month. It seems everyone involved will be relieved to have more time to work on the proposal.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>It appears you would enjoy going to an enchanting woodland location near water, and your best time to go will be plus or minus five days of the full moon in Pisces on August 30. Saturn will be conjunct that full moon, so you may be able to combine business with pleasure, or you might have a certain personal goal to complete at your destination. It looks as though you would be returning within five days of August 30. You could have problems with water—drink bottled water, follow authorities’ advice if storms and flash flooding is due, and only swim in the ocean if a lifeguard is on duty. Cancers born early in their sign with a June birthday will reap the most benefits from this full moon.</p>
<p>If you have an international relationship that has been ongoing, you will hear from your client or overseas office with important news on or near August 30. There is an excellent chance a bigger title is due for you with more responsibilities that you will be ready to take on. Keep your antenna up.</p>
<p>Pieces of your puzzle should start to fall into place next month, step by step, and they will be more noticeable after September 15.</p>
