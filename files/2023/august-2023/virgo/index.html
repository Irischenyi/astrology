        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>August is not going to be a highly productive month, as it has flawed new and full moons, but as a Virgo, you seem to do much better than most. Right now, half the solar system is in earth signs like your Virgo Sun: Jupiter, Uranus, Mercury, Mars, and Pluto. You have two big planets that will help, too—Neptune and Saturn are in water signs that blend beautifully with all the earth planets. Water plus earth makes flowers. Although it appears you are ultra-busy, you seem to feel that your world is a friendly place to be these days, a place that can support your dearest dreams. If you feel this way, you are right.</p>
<p>Will there be obstacles? Oh sure, but those have never stopped you in your tracks. The biggest problem is going to be Mercury retrograde, due August 23 until September 15, but I am getting ahead of myself here. I will get back to Mercury, so instead let’s start at the top of the month.</p>
<p>On August 1 the full moon in Aquarius, 9 degrees, puts Uranus in the lead, and Uranus will reach out to Neptune, Saturn, and Pluto in a very congenial way, so you will have solid support from co-workers or subordinates. You may have to hire someone, but it would be best to conduct the interview next month, after September 15.</p>
<p>This Aquarius full moon indicates that you’ll be wrapping up tasks that had to be finished by this full moon’s date, August 1. If you were able to get an extension, you should finish up no later than August 5.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>If you do not feel this full moon when it comes to a work project or major personal task being finished, or the need to hire help, you may have instead seen a health matter reach a finish point, perhaps by getting test results back from the doctor, completing an extended course of physical therapy, or finishing some dental work. This is a fairly straightforward full moon, so the results seem positive.</p>
<p>On the same day as the full moon, August 1, you have one sterling aspect separate from the full moon—active Mars in Virgo will be perfectly in sync with good-fortune planet Jupiter in Taurus. News from a person in an international setting will make you happy, for Jupiter is in your ninth house. If it is not an international situation that captures your attention, alternatively you may get good news about a legal case concerning a media assignment (in broadcasting or publishing) or news connected to your efforts to get a degree from a college or university. This will be thrilling information in the first week of August—Jupiter in sync with Mars (a trine) is a major aspect that comes around usually once a year.</p>
<p>This will be a slow month, for five out of ten heavenly bodies will be retrograde: Venus, Mercury, Saturn, Neptune, and Pluto. (Uranus will go retrograde August 28, and Jupiter will go retrograde September 4, so those two planets are already slowing down.) You will have both the time to look back and assess how everything has been going, and the energy to make a situation better. If you want to polish up a report or manuscript, for example, you will have the time to do it. You will be dealing with a number of postponements and cancellations, so your schedule will open up. Nothing of earth-shattering importance will occur in August.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mars is currently in your sign, a wonderful privilege that began last month on July 10 that will continue until August 27.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>The universe is speaking in riddles, but because you have Mars in Virgo, and Mars is in solidly good shape, you will be eager to get going on projects and goals. However, Neptune will oppose Mercury mid-month, so nothing will be clear—you may feel you are walking through a foggy, veiled landscape. People around you simply won’t be communicating well, and they won’t be decisive either. Others will be on vacation or impossible to reach. Alas, we are all in the same boat. No zodiac sign will escape this environment, although I will admit, Virgo and Gemini will feel this more as Mercury rules those signs.</p>
<p>As said, your ruler Mercury will go retrograde from August 23 to September 15. For that reason, I want you to delay just about every important action you need to take. Do not sign a contract, and don’t accept a new opportunity, such as a new apartment or job, if at all possible. I worry that you would regret your decision later. Mercury also rules machines and electronic chips, so put off buying any electronic items until after September 15.</p>
<p>Mercury retrograde brings confusion, miscommunication, and forgetfulness, and also causes us to rush and not make considered, deliberate decisions, causing those decisions to be upended later. You may not like the apartment, or the job may be all wrong for you. Be careful this month.</p>
<p>Venus started to retrograde on July 22 and will go direct on September 3. Since Venus is weak in this period, if you are single, don’t have a first date. Wait until after Venus and Mercury (the communication planet) are both direct. You want to give a new relationship the best start possible. The day you have your first date becomes the birth of your relationship, and that day affects the entire term of your relationship (and the day you marry affects it even more).</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>I wrote a great deal about Venus retrograde last month, and you can still access your July report. We always keep the month before posted, but then it disappears. You can see it on my Astrology Zone Horoscopes app (swipe to the left) or on my website—look for the blue box at the bottom of my column that says, “View Previous Month.”</p>
<p>Venus rules love, beauty, luxury, fun, and parties, but none of these areas go well when Venus is retrograde. Don’t have plastic surgery or Botox fillers, and men, don’t shave off your beard or grow one. Everyone, stick to the status quo. You can do regular grooming, of course, but don’t make radical changes to your looks, or you may not like how things turn out. Make all your changes after September 15.</p>
<p>You likely will work hard over the full moon in Aquarius on August 1, for by the time you get to the new moon in Leo on August 16, you will be craving privacy and rest. This new moon will fall in your twelfth house of voluntary solitude, where you can think while you escape from the hustle bustle of life and silence the cacophony of voices around you.</p>
<p>The new moon in Leo on August 16 (23 degrees) seems to bring jarring news in the very same area that had brought such good news earlier, all related to your ninth house of international relations, travel, media, legal matters, and higher education. Uranus will be in hard angle to the Sun, new moon, and Venus—news will likely rattle you.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>Again, every one of every sign will notice the jarring effects of this full moon, so we are all in this together. Knowing that others will likely to be forced to face unexpected news, this would not be the time to ask for a favor. Everyone will be a little fragile. A new moon extends its influence for weeks, but it is strongest for the following ten days.</p>
<p>What you hear during this new moon on August 16 might have something to do with a friend or family member (more likely a friend)—something a friend has done or something that has happened to her may be causing her stress. In that latter example, you would want to help. Your friend might need a procedure in a hospital or other medical facility, and your twelfth house, where the new moon is based, could easily put you in contact with medical personnel.</p>
<p>There’s a second full moon later this month, a blue moon, on August 30 in Pisces at 7 degrees. This full moon will light your house of committed partners, and this will be someone you are aligned with closely, such as your marriage partner or your business agent or lawyer. This will be a watershed moment, for this full moon will conjunct Saturn, forcing you to see your relationship in the glare of daylight.</p>
<p>Things are coming to a culmination, and if you have not been happy and have tried everything to make this relationship work, you will have to decide what to do, but you won’t be able to ignore the facts. You may try couples therapy or finally give up and leave.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>It is now one month before your birthday, a time of reflection and planning for your new personal year ahead. In astrology, the ancients believed that life is best if we plan and not let time run through our fingers. As a Virgo, one of your greatest talents is to organize, prioritize, and set worthy goals, so you will be in your element this month. You will see this trend begin at the new moon on August 16.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, on August 1, you will see an important task reach an end. Perhaps because you are hoping to travel, you may need to get it done, with all details checked for accuracy, no later than August 5. Keep your health up to par, as you seem to be concentrating hard at this point in August. You will need to be alert so you can catch and manage any glitches that might come up.</p>
<p>There is some indication that you may be talking with medical personnel, either for yourself or for a friend or family member (it seems to be a friend). In this latter case, act as an advocate, and provide emotional support.</p>
<p>Also, on August 1 Mars and Jupiter will be in sync, a wonderful aspect for launching something new that can make you money, especially if you work with an international client or if the project is tied to the education market. Legal matters will go well, too.</p>
<p>Mars is currently in your sign, a wonderful privilege that began last month on July 10 that will continue until August 27. Mercury, your ruling planet, and whose job is to take good care of you, will be “out of the office” when retrograde, starting August 23 until September 15. As you can see, Mercury will cut into the beneficial period of enjoying the control you will have while Mars is in Virgo. This behooves you to use the first two weeks of August to your advantage by making key decisions, and after that, it might be best to delay making any final agreements until the second half of September. Put off buying a computer, car, or any electronic item until the second half of September as well.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>Venus started to retrograde in Leo last month and will continue to be retrograde until September 3. This is not the month to go shopping for an important piece of jewelry or to make any cosmetic changes to your appearance—that includes refraining from scheduling a radical new hair style or color or going for Botox or fillers.</p>
<p>Life will generally feel a little better after the Sun moves to Virgo on August 23, and I say that even with Mercury going retrograde on that day for three and a half weeks. Having the Sun on your side giving you warm favor is always beneficial.</p>
<p>When Mars moves to Libra from August 27 to October 11, you will be spending more money than usual. You may have delayed certain purchases, or certain commitments will come due at that time. However, your expenses likely won’t be unexpected, for unpredictable Uranus won’t be adverse—in fact, Uranus will be helpful, so you may find money from a new, surprise source. Your expenses may relate to a tax bill, student or bank loan, or another type of payment that will be necessary. You may have put money aside in anticipation of heavy check writing, in which case you will breeze through this period more easily.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>When it comes to love, you are in one of two places. Saturn is in your marriage house, so you may be ready to build a foundation for the future with your one truelove. If you are married, in the coming three years Saturn will test the strength of your union and your commitment to it. A strong union will thrive, and a weak one will likely break apart. There is no destiny here, however—if your partner means a lot to you, you can opt for couples therapy to get to the heart of the problem.</p>
<p>It takes two to make a marriage work well, so a lot depends on your feelings, your partner’s attitude, and the value you both place on the union. The second full moon of the month on August 30 will be a testing moment—think of it as a litmus test for your relationship.</p>
<p>This same test, brought by Saturn on August 30, can apply instead to a business partnership or collaboration. In time you will know if you can make the relationship work or if you want to leave your romantic or business alliance. Everything in the universe moves toward strength and productivity, and we must, too.</p>
