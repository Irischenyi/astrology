        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>Life will pause a bit in August, for five planets are retrograde: Venus, Mercury, Saturn, Neptune, and Pluto (and Uranus will go retrograde August 28). The most important ones for you to watch will include Venus, retrograde since July 22 and due to go direct September 3, and Mercury, retrograde August 23 and due to go direct September 15.</p>
<p>Don’t rail against the delays—we all will be feeling them. As postponements and temporary cancellations come up, your schedule will open, and you will be able to follow your own agenda with the free time that results.</p>
<p>The minute the month opens you will be dealing with a full moon in Aquarius, 9 degrees. There seems to be an unexpected event regarding your home, and it might rattle you. Uranus will be the key planet at this full moon, and it will be in hard angle to the moon. The focus of this full moon will be centered on your home or the well-being of a family member.</p>
<p>You may get a sudden home-related expense for a major repair, or it may be that your landlord suddenly tells you she wants to sell your apartment and you need to move. This could send you into a panic at the thought of having to leave. You would receive not even a tiny hint before this news is delivered.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>Alternatively, if you are living with a roommate or romantic partner, you may get sudden news that that your roommate, spouse, or serious live-in lover is leaving with no notice—perhaps because you are breaking up. If you own other property, a tenant may suddenly leave, breaking the lease and disappearing into the night. In these examples, you may have to pay the entire rent or mortgage until you can find a new tenant or roommate to share costs. Uranus is known to deliver sometimes shocking news.</p>
<p>Pluto, found at the very bottom of your horoscope and within two tiny degrees of the cusp of your home sector (fourth house), might help you—Uranus will be in an outstandingly harmonious (trine) angle to Pluto, a rare aspect we haven’t seen in decades. This tells me your family may be willing to help with money, tips, introductions, or advice that might prove quite helpful to unlock any dilemma that you may be dealing with.</p>
<p>If you are married, Jupiter’s position suggests your spouse may come up with a good idea. A bank loan seems impossible, as Mercury, which rules this part of your chart, will be tightly opposed to Saturn. Translation: The terms of a bank loan would be too rigid and expensive. I feel if you need money quickly it would more likely come from family.</p>
<blockquote><p>In your house of professional achievements, you have the mighty Sun, the new moon, and Venus all tightly banded together—you are clearly loved by VIPs and also by subordinates who want to work for you.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>Let’s now turn to the new moon August 16, which will accent your career. This new moon will fall in Leo at 23 degrees and is mixed in outlook. All new moons open a door and present an opportunity, and this one is no exception—it appears a new chapter is starting up in your professional life. You may be starting a new position or opening the doors of your own new business. It is also possible you will be working in a new department or on a new project that excites you.</p>
<p>Leo, the placement of the new moon, is connected to entertainment, the arts, theatre, music, and luxury brands. Leo also rules products directed toward children, from books and games to education, clothing, TV programming, and more. One of these areas could very well be an area that you are working in now.</p>
<p>The problem is that this August 16 new moon will receive a direct, tight challenge from Uranus. Indeed, Uranus will aim his cannons at the Sun, new moon, and Venus, all based in your prestigious tenth house of honors, awards, and achievements—those heavenly bodies are traveling as if glued together in Leo. Uranus could bring unstable situations to the surface regarding your career, your home, or a close family member, such as your mother. There appears to be a push-pull between the needs of higher-ups at work and the needs of family at home.</p>
<p>Uranus is based in your seventh house of “open enemies” and could bring a competitor or naysayer who may try to disrupt your professional efforts. I feel you can clearly see the troublesome person, so that’s good—this is necessary if you are to cope up with a remedy or counterstrategy. Again, the nature of Uranus is to act spontaneously. This is a new moon, so it may take some time to work out this obstacle. There is no need to rush—take your time, for you can win this round.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>Interestingly, along with this challenging aspect brought on by Uranus during the new moon, a golden triangle of harmony among planets is forming, linking your ruler Mars in Virgo and your other ruler Pluto in Capricorn. Both are linking to Uranus in Taurus, your partnership house. Your rulers are always weighted more heavily in any configuration. That’s good—this group of planets can help you. There are so many crosscurrents, you would need a scorecard to keep up. Neptune will oppose Mercury, so communication will be garbled. Don’t make any important decisions this month. Observe and do your research, but do not act until September 15. I’ll tell you why in a minute.</p>
<p>As mentioned at the top of your report, five out of ten heavenly bodies will be retrograde in August: Venus, Mercury, Saturn, Neptune, and Pluto will all be retrograde (as well as Uranus, August 28, and Jupiter, September 4, which means they’re both already slowing down). The Sun and moon never retrograde, so Mars is the only planet in good shape. The planets are almost forcing you to look back over past months and assess what went well and what went off the rails—and how to fix those speed bumps.</p>
<p>Of the planets listed, the most prominent will be Venus and Mercury retrograde. Venus started to retrograde in Leo on July 22 and will go direct on September 3. Venus rules your partnership (or competitor) sector, so I feel you will do better in September if there is someone in your circle trying to take away some of your thunder.</p>
<p>There are other considerations with Venus in retrograde. In matters of romance, don’t go on a first date. If you do set a first date in August, you will have a weak, debilitated Venus in the “birth” of your relationship—affection may be warm at the start but then grow cold, making you wonder what happened. The day you select for your first date will set the tone and term of the relationship, and you need a strong Venus to give it a shot at longevity. When you marry, that date will supersede the date you first go out together, but you need to make it to marriage! With a weak Venus, that’s unclear.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>Venus rules love, beauty, and luxury, so delay buying pricey jewelry or designer goods, and don’t throw a lavish party in August. Put off scheduling any changes to your appearance, such as cometic dentistry, Botox or fillers from your dermatologist, or a face lift, for you may not like the result. Don’t make any radical changes to the cut or color of your hair, and men, don’t shave off your beard or grow one. Everyone should stick to the status quo.</p>
<p>More of a concern this month is the impending move of Mercury retrograde from August 23 to September 15—you will feel the slowdown of Mercury 14 days before it officially turns. Mercury will retrograde in Virgo, a sign it rules, so Mercury’s effects will be stronger than usual. I would say wait until September 15 to resume normal activities.</p>
<p>Put off buying a car, computer, smart phone, or any electronic item with a chip or which has moving parts (Mercury rules both) until after September 15, and add a space of several days before initiating important actions. Do not sign a contract, for you’ll likely have to renegotiate it later. If you feel you would lose the opportunity if you don’t sign, then you may have to sign or verbally agree to an offer—but know that you may not stay long in that situation. Build in an exit clause, and look for missing or unclear clauses that would benefit from greater clarity.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the month’s second full moon due August 30 in Pisces, 7 degrees. As you see, there are two full moons in August, and the second one is called a blue moon. It will fall in your fifth house of love and children. Saturn will tightly conjunct this full moon, adding a serious, somber, or thoughtful tone to events.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>A full moon brings situations to the surface and presents a certain urgency to think about, so if you are dating but not happy with the person you are with, you may feel it is time to decide whether to stay or go.</p>
<p>If you had scheduled a vacation (whether the trip is long and overseas or short, comprising just a few days, and nearby), you may have concerns about one of your children and cancel the trip. Concern for the welfare of a child could come up at this full moon within five days after it appears.</p>
<p>If you hear that many of your small child’s friends are coming down with bad colds, you may want to keep your child solitary and away from other children (and not schedule play dates) in the week leading up to the full moon. If your child is older, you may have to help in a bigger way, say, with special lessons on a certain subject in school that have proven tough to learn. If you have an adult child, you might want to send money if your son or daughter is in a jam and needs a lifeline.</p>
<p>If you are in the midst of a divorce and an agreement over custody is finalized at the full moon August 30, you may not like the final plan, but you will need to be realistic, which will be hard. With Saturn present, it will be very difficult to get the agreement changed.</p>
<p>The fifth house is also the house of creativity, so if you are working on a project dear to your heart, it may be nearing conclusion, but might need more time and money than you had estimated—causing stress.</p>
<p>Luckily, a full moon only has a short circle of influence of about five days beyond the date of first appearance. This would encompass August 30 to September 4. Keep your health up to par, and be sure to get enough sleep. When a challenging full moon comes by, it feels harder if you are overtired and have not been eating nutritiously.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>September will be easier and smoother, so keep smiling, dear Scorpio.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>This month reflects your striving to find balance between your public and private life. It opens with a full moon on August 1 in Aquarius, bringing your attention to matters of home and family within five days of its appearance. Many Scorpios have been moving house over the past two years (due to the position of Uranus), and it may be that this full moon will mark your moving day into your beautiful new apartment or house. Alternatively, you might rent a vacation cottage for August. Or the contractor may finish up your home renovation so you finally get to use your new kitchen or bathroom. It is also possible you will receive an exciting delivery of new furniture.</p>
<p>Still, Uranus is being difficult and will challenge this full moon, so you may receive a shocking piece of news related to your home. You might hear that you have a massive repair that has to be fixed, and it is expensive. Or your roommate or live-in lover may announce he or she is moving out, leaving you to pay all the rent by yourself. Your landlord may say you have to move because she sold the building. There are laws to protect tenants, so find out what those are—perhaps your landlord would have to give you money to cover your moving expenses. Fortunately, the news of a full moon does not linger (only about five days)—you have to find a way to respond, but after you do, the effects of the full moon will be over.</p>
<p>At the new moon on August 16 in Leo, 23 degrees, Uranus still won’t be in a good position. The planet of unanticipated news, Uranus will challenge the Sun, new moon, and Venus—all in your career house—from its position in your partnership house. You may wonder if your headhunter, job broker, or lawyer is actually working in your interest. A competitor may make some unfair moves in desperation to either take away some of your market share or, if you have been interviewing for a top job, get the job offer instead. Alternatively, you may feel your spouse is not showing enthusiasm about your work opportunities, and that may be unnerving to you.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>You are clearly favored in the workplace, so stay strong. Here is why you should not be overly worried:</p>
<p>At the same time as the new moon, August 16, a golden triangle will appear in the night sky. The first tip of the triangle will point to Pluto, your ruler, in Capricorn at the bottom of your chart, straddling your third house of agreements and fourth house of home and family—both will be protected. The second tip of the triangle will point to your house of partners and collaborators, to Uranus. The third tip of the triangle will point to Mars, your other ruler, who is holding hands with Mercury in your eleventh house of hopes and wishes. This is quite a lineup of glamourous, helpful planets, which means you are holding four aces in your pocket.</p>
<p>In your house of reputation and professional achievements, you have the mighty Sun, the new moon, and Venus all tightly banded together—you are clearly loved by VIPs and also by subordinates who want to work for you and learn from you. So, while you may be upset by something that you hear or see happening in your professional life mid-month—and you will have to address it—do not be overly concerned. Your outlook shows that you can ultimately straighten any wobbles to your satisfaction, for you can count on extraordinary help from friendly planets elsewhere in your chart.</p>
<p>The full moon on August 30 is interesting. It will light your fifth house of true love, a house that also rules children. Saturn, however, will conjunct the full moon, giving it a serious overtone. It may be that you will make an important decision about the sweetheart you are dating or whether or not to have a baby soon. If your child is grown, you may suddenly miss them because they are now off to college.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>There is another possibility: You may have to cancel a trip due to concern for your child’s health. In that case, try not to schedule play dates in the last week of the month as you get closer to this full moon—your child may come down with something.</p>
<p>Saturn will ask you to think about the long road ahead. If you already have a child, you may be concerned about their happiness and welfare. If you sent your child to camp, you may find out he or she is hopelessly homesick and you will need to drive to collect them early, before the end of the term, to come home and be close to you. You will be glad to do it.</p>
<p>Saturn can sometimes make people feel a little tired and overwhelmed, so if the demands of parenthood are strong at this time, treat yourself to extra help from a nanny. If your grown, adult child is in distress over a financial matter, you may decide to help out. These are examples, but you see the possibilities of how this may unfold.</p>
<p>The full moon on August 30 may have an alternative outcome. This area of your chart also rules your creativity, so you may be finishing up an important creative project and hoping for positive critical reviews. With Saturn close by, you may worry too much—Scorpios are known to seek excellence in themselves and others. You likely have poured a great deal of love and energy into your artistic project, so relax—chances are, good reviews will roll in.</p>
