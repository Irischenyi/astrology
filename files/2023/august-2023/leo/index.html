        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>This year, Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, is still shining at the very pinnacle in your chart, showering your tenth house of professional opportunities with a blizzard of celebratory golden confetti. After 12 years of waiting, Jupiter entered this part of your chart on May 16, and happily, he will continue to send blessings to your career until May 25, 2024.</p>
<p>The minute you start the month, on August 1, Mars will reach out to Jupiter, and since Mars is in your money-salary sector and Jupiter is in your professional sector, it appears you are due for some very good news about career progress, along with money commensurate with your growing title and influence. August 1 is a fantastic day for career news.</p>
<p>On the same day, August 1, the full moon will occur in Aquarius, 9 degrees, and will direct your attention to your committed partner in marriage or in business. Something is reaching a culmination with your partner—perhaps you hope to talk something over that has been on your mind. Alternatively, you may want to choose a new goal that you can work on together. If the partner has a business with you, you could be talking with him or her, an agent, new lawyer, accountant—even a wedding planner or any expert you would work with in a one-on-one collaborative, confidential way to achieve a specific mutual goal.</p>
<p>Mars is in your second house of earned income, so you are in an expensive period where you are spending more, but you may have planned to do so. Nevertheless, you may be feeling that you need more money, and you might be anxious to review your array of options with your partner. For now, just talk—with Saturn opposite Mars and Mercury this month, finding the right answer will be hard and take some time. By mid-month Neptune will oppose Mercury too, adding fog and confusion. Etch nothing in stone in August.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>To get the right answers, you need the right questions. Considering that four planets are retrograde by mid-month (Venus, Saturn, Neptune, and Pluto), and that Mercury (August 23) and Uranus (August 28) will go retrograde toward the end of the month, you will be urged to think deeply. Take your time and do your research, but most importantly, be experimental and brainstorm ideas with your partner. Neither of you should accuse the other if a problem comes up—that will get you nowhere. Be playful when you generate ideas, offering up strange and weird remedies, too. There should be no limit on ideas—crazy ideas are okay—for among all those ideas you generate, one might strike you as doable if you can twist it and refine it.</p>
<p>Venus, Mars, and Mercury are the three planets to watch when retrograde (Mars is in good shape now and not retrograding). This group is important because they orbit close to Earth, and you would more strongly feel their influence when retrograde than when the other planets retrograde. Retrogrades deliberately slow us all down so we will reconsider recent events and decisions.</p>
<p>Venus entered her retrograde on July 22, and will go direct September 3. That means this month, keep your appearance as is, with only minor changes, such as going to have your hair trimmed, for example—do not make a radical change to your hair style or color. The key word here is “radical,” but of course you can follow good grooming. This is not the time to have Botox or fillers from your dermatologist (you may not like the results), nor is it the time for cosmetic dentistry. Put off getting engaged for now too, and do not have a big lavish party or buy pricy jewelry until after September 3 (and leave a space of a few days, but best to wait until Mercury goes direct, too).</p>
<blockquote><p>A discussion you have in the early days of August could lead to a better salary and an advancement in your firm. If you are self-employed, you may be able to bring in a prestigious client.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>Mercury will go retrograde from August 23 to September 15, so move all decisions and major actions to after September 15 (again, plus a few days). I would say that the actions listed for Venus should take place after September 15, too. Mercury rules intellectual matters, including negotiations, contracts, agreements, and buying and selling, as well as machines and products with electronic chips. That’s why you should not buy any electronic items or machines until after September 15, leaving a space of a few days before taking action. This same timeline is applicable for starting any important endeavor.</p>
<p>The new moon in Leo due August 16 is usually a time for you to take advantage of an opportunity, but this new moon is flawed. Uranus, the planet of unpredictable action, will be in hard angle to the Sun (your ruling star), the new moon, and to Venus (which rules your reputation and efforts to get ahead in your career). Uranus is in the same house as Jupiter, but they are not close. This new moon seems to bring a chance to do something, but you will likely hesitate because as you look closer, it won’t seem right for you.</p>
<p>Uranus also rules the rebel, so you may be thinking about simply leaving your job and starting your own company. Don’t be hasty—look at all the various facets of the new life that you hope to create. That way, you won’t be blindsided by changes you didn’t see coming, which you might not like. We can’t foresee all the changes up ahead, but we can make an effort to find many of them, the same way a chess player anticipates the other’s moves in a dynamic game.</p>
<p>There are many ways this new moon could work out, but it does appear that your career is on your mind after its arrival on August 16. Whatever comes up seems to completely surprise or even shock you. You might have a problem with a business partner or collaborator—this person seems connected to your work. Leos born on or near August 16 (plus five day or minus two days) will feel this new moon the most (other Leos may not notice much of this at all).</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>The lunar eclipses in Taurus and Scorpio that started back on November 19, 2021, have played havoc in your life. They arrived every six months in pairs two weeks apart, and the last one came by on May 5, 2023. Those eclipses were operating on your career and home life, including your residence and other property you might have owned or wanted to buy, sell, or rent. If your physical home was not on your mind, then you may have been focused on a family member. You only have one more eclipse in this troublesome Scorpio-Taurus series, due on October 28, 2023. After the end of October, life will become easier. The October 28 eclipse will be a mild one, arriving hand in hand with Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, so I think you will find the October 28 eclipse to work in your favor.</p>
<p>Life looks very different for you now, but in fact, even though some of the eclipses in the past two-year series were difficult, they did sweep away the cobwebs in your life. By that I mean the eclipses deleted all that was unproductive and of no future value. Eclipses bring an end to conditions that are holding you back. Between now and the end of May 2024, your career will be the first to show a dramatic uptick in success, and when you feel you have found the right role, you will feel much happier.</p>
<p>Money, however, is still on your mind, as evidenced by the full moon in Pisces on August 30. That full moon will be conjunct with practical, tough teacher Saturn, who will likely ask you to pay a bill. It may be hard to find all the funds you need to pay the bill this month. Something regarding money seems to be difficult to cope with at this full moon, but it will be necessary that you do. I advise you not to invest money in anything until after September 15. In the meantime, get advice from your financial advisor, or read up on the topic or area where you may want to put money.</p>
<p>Saturn may make you feel temporarily depressed or deflated (in your case, mainly about money) at this full moon. This feeling will pass in three or four days. Also, keep in mind that you have a lot going for you when it comes to career and money. Let me show you.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>Aside from a wild new moon (August 16) and a maddening full moon (August 30), something else is happening in your chart at the very same time—and it’s absolutely terrific.</p>
<p>In the second half of August, but particularly from August 27 onward, a golden triangle of harmony will appear in the night sky, linking Jupiter and Uranus in Taurus (both in your career sector) to Mercury (news) in your financial salary sector to Pluto in your work-a-day assignment sector. The planets keep moving, but all through the second half of August this rare harmony among planets will be revealed. This tells me your plans are taking you in the right direction.</p>
<p>Life may look very different these days, but embrace it—the eclipses have been asking you to redefine your career and sense of purpose and also to think about family and housing.</p>
<p>This month is a bit of an anomaly, so don’t let anything worry you—keep to your program. You are doing so well!</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>The month starts out with a full moon in Aquarius, putting a spotlight on your closest relationship in love (such as with your spouse or serious sweetheart) or business (such as a business partner, agent, lawyer, accountant, or other professional). Over the past three years you’ve hosted taskmaster Saturn in this partnership area of life, so a full moon in this sector was not always welcome, as a full moon is capable of showing weak links in an alliance. This year, the outlook is different and much brighter because Saturn has moved out of Aquarius.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>Indeed, Saturn has made an exit for good—he left on March 7, 2023, and will not return to Aquarius, your partnership sector, again until 2050. This means future full moons in this house, including the one this month, should reflect smoother, happier close relationships in both your personal and business life. If you are still partners with the person you focused on at some point over the past three years—where things between you could have gone either way—then that person who was tested in your life will likely remain. This would mean that you and your partner passed Saturn’s test.</p>
<p>The full moon on August 1 will emphasize matters related to attached Leos, but what about single ones? If you are unattached and not dating seriously, you need to be patient. Venus has been in Leo—but in retrograde—since July 22, so this is not the time to find your one truelove. When Venus sleeps, as she will continue to do now through September 3, she withholds her finest powers of warmth and affection. If you have a former love, you may hear from that person now, but it is not clear if things will ultimately work out. Keep in mind that there was a reason the relationship broke apart.</p>
<p>You will not lose any time with Venus retrograde in Leo, as Venus will awaken from her nap on September 3 and remain her usual length of time in Leo, strong and able to help you until October 8. Set your sights on having a much more social time from September 3 to October 8, for by then Venus will be strong in Leo and Mars, Venus’ lover, will be in compatible Libra. Weekend trips will be especially carefree and fun.</p>
<p>The same date as the full moon, August 1, marks a sparkling career date when Mars and Jupiter will work in concert to bring your professional reputation and compensation into shining alignment. A discussion you have in the early days of August could lead to a better salary and an advancement in your firm. If you are self-employed, you may be able to bring in a prestigious client who will pay you well for a job you will likely be excited to do. It’s an important date, where plans made now can eventually lead to profit—make your final agreement in mid-September.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>Additionally, in a special professional trend brought to you by Jupiter, your career will be especially favored now straight through May 25, 2024. Even though you will encounter obstacles along the way, you will be able to overcome them with innovative ideas. Jupiter, planet of good fortune, will help you, as you are the most favored of all signs in 2023 for career advancement and breakthroughs.</p>
<p>The new moon in Leo on August 16 will set you off in a new direction. This new path may be one taken by choice, or it could be required, but either way it’s time to make more changes. You will need to be flexible—not always easy for you. Leo is a fixed sign, which means you are hard-wired to uphold and contain the structure set in place “now,” and you often don’t see a need to redo it.</p>
<p>Unexpected news about a career matter might rattle you after this new moon on August 16 appears, but the situation will be temporary. The matter seems to have something to do with a partner or collaborator who is not willing to support your ideas. You need this person to row his or her boat in the same direction as you, but that seems not to be the case. Because this is a new moon, it could take some time to work out the difficulties in this relationship, but other planets are favorable and will aid you.</p>
<p>By August 30 and the full moon in Pisces, it will be time to make adjustments to financial matters and pay bills. Overall, you will be motivated to put your house in order. Like everything else this month, unexpected financial news might come up again, and Saturn will conjunct the full moon and oppose the Sun, so you will be forced to be realistic and accepting of what you need to do. Don’t spend time focused on what you can’t control—focus on what you can. Neptune will oppose Mercury and Mars, so don’t put financial plans in stone just yet—you will need to be flexible. Mull over what you need to do while you await better days. Choose late September to begin.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>Mercury will be retrograde from August 23 until September 15. Get as many vital things done as you can in the first week of August. It is not favorable to make agreements during this phase, as later you would likely need to renegotiate them.</p>
<p>Venus will continue to retrograde throughout August until September 3, so hold off on making any radical changes to your appearance. This is not the time to have a first date either—Venus rules affection, and when in weak retrograde, your relationship, which might start off in an exciting place with great chemistry, may fall flat. The day you start seeing someone is the “birth” of the relationship—you want it to be strong and with Venus’ support.</p>
<p>In August, see friends, read a good book—everything starts for you on September 15, when both Mercury and Venus are orbiting direct.</p>
