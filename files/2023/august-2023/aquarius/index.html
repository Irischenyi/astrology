        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>Look up in the sky, dear Aquarius, and you will see a huge full moon in Aquarius, 9 degrees, as big as a giant pizza pie. It is a supermoon, August 1, (influential until August 5). It’s called a supermoon because the moon is traveling closer to earth, so the it appears bigger than normal. This full moon falls in your sign, so a personal situation or a close relationship in love or business and of enormous personal importance to you will reach culmination. If you are not focused on a relationship, then a home-related matter might come up.</p>
<p>As the ruler of Aquarius, Uranus will play the lead role in this August 1 full moon, and Uranus is based in Taurus, your home sector. For some Aquarians, this full moon might mark moving day or the time you reform the look and feel of your home. Or you may make (or see) changes regarding your family.</p>
<p>Due the recent eclipses in Taurus and Scorpio that were focusing on your home and immediate family members (including parents), you may have seen changes there or in your career—or both. You only have one more eclipse in this series, and it will be a mild, even beneficial eclipse because it will arrive conjunct Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck. (It will be nothing like the tough November 8, 2022, or May 5, 2023, eclipses.) The last eclipse in the series will arrive October 28 in Taurus, again focusing on your career.</p>
<p>Coming back to this month’s full moon August 1, Uranus will challenge Venus with a harsh square angle, and Venus is based in your marriage/partnership sector, so you may experience a quick, unexpected conflict with your spouse, established romantic partner, or an agent or other person you work with in a one-on-one confidential way. At the same time, you will be in the spotlight, and you may even be interviewed by the press.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>You seem to have been spending more money than usual lately, ever since Mars entered your eighth house of other people’s money last month on July 10. Your credit card balance may have gone up a bit, but this trend will thankfully calm down once you get to August 27 when Mars moves to another sign.</p>
<p>Before Mars moves in August’s last days, you have a gorgeous aspect in August’s first week. Leading through the weekend encompassing August 5, Mars will signal Jupiter in your short travel sector. You may get a chance to be on the road and get into a relaxed resort where you can soak up sunshine and fresh air.</p>
<p>This same house of your horoscope, the third house, governs agreements and contracts, but I would caution you to be careful about anything you sign or agree to. Here is why.</p>
<p>As you enter August, four out of eight planets are retrograde—Venus, Saturn, Neptune, and Pluto. (The Sun and moon never retrograde.) Mercury will retrograde on August 23, and Uranus will reverse direction on August 28. Then Jupiter will begin his slow down shortly thereafter on September 4. That means only Mars is in top shape. The planets that we feel most when retrograde are Mars, Venus, and Mercury, and two of them will be in a weak state.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mars will move to Libra on August 27, suggesting an end to financial problems. Libra is an air sign like your Aquarius Sun, and all of life will improve.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>Venus went retrograde on July 22 and will go direct September 3. Venus rules beauty, luxury, romantic love, and profits. Venus also rules anything that embellishes, such as jewelry and beautiful lingerie or fine wine and imported chocolates, as some examples. If you were planning to buy expensive jewelry, wait until next month to choose the piece. If you were planning on getting a radically different haircut or color, or hoping to see your dermatologist about Botox or fillers, again, wait until next month, ideally after September 15, the date Venus’ brother Mercury will go direct (I will explain about Mercury retrograde in a minute).</p>
<p>Single Aquarians should not have a first date this month for Venus rules love and affection, and a weak Venus will not let you access her greatest powers. It’s best not to “give birth” to a new relationship with Venus retrograde—if you do, affections will likely cool of fairly soon. If you’re going back to an old flame, that’s OK because you started the relationship a long time ago. However, there was a reason you broke up, so there are no guarantees here—see how you feel.</p>
<p>Additionally, Venus retrograde is not a good time to give a lavish party or schedule a charity fundraiser, for donations are likely to be low.</p>
<p>I wrote a lot about Venus retrograde last month in my July forecast, which is still posted. If you are on the Internet on my website, look for the blue box at the bottom of each page of your forecast that says “View Previous Month.” (I do not archive my monthly forecasts on the Internet or app, only the previous month, so in this case you can still read July.)</p>
<p>On my app “Astrology Zone Horoscope Susan Miller” (Apple App Store and Google Play), once you are in the current monthly forecast for your sign, simply tap on the previous month’s heading to the left, and you will see that month’s forecast.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>By the way, one of the features that Apple has (but not Android) is a “Read to Me” feature (see settings and turn it on). No need to read—you can choose to have my forecast read to you in any voice offered that you like best.</p>
<p>By the end of this month, we’ll have six out of eight planets retrograde, but the two that matter most—because they orbit close to Earth—are Venus and Mercury.</p>
<p>As you see, August will have a very slow start. Mercury is slowing down on its way to go retrograde from August 23 to September 15 in Virgo, the sign Mercury rules, making this Mercury retrograde a bit stronger than usual. You will need to closely watch to see that payments due to you come in. Also, make sure you are not the object of identity theft—I find looking at my bank’s app every day a blessing. I can see what came in and what went out, and last year I saw a check I never wrote for $14,711 “pending.” I stopped it in time, so I lost no money (and my bank didn’t lose money either).</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the month’s new moon, which is due August 16 in Leo, 23 degrees. Like at the full moon August 1, your ruling planet Uranus is being an untamed wild child, and this time he will be on quite a rampage. Everyone of every sign will be feeling the fallout from his behavior. Uranus is your ruler, so in some ways it may feel more personal to you.</p>
<p>Uranus is in your home and family sector (fourth house) and is a planet known to bring unanticipated, unwanted surprise news when in a harsh aspect like now (square to the new moon and Sun). Those tremors will likely emanate from your home, other property, or a family member.</p>
<p>Uranus is aiming his rampage at the new moon in Leo, your seventh house of partnership—your marriage partner, committed established romantic partner (but have not married), a close business ally, like a business partner, agent, lawyer, accountant, live-in nanny, or even a specialist in your personal life, such as an event or wedding planner.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>Anyone you have a contract with might be the object of this new moon, and this would include your spouse.</p>
<p>In addition to physical property, this fourth house (where Uranus is) also rules a family member, and for most people, this would point to a parent. Alternatively, the person in question could be a child (grown or still small). Clearly there is conflict between a partner and a home or family matter.</p>
<p>The seventh house of serious partnerships, where this new moon will appear in your chart, is also the house of “open enemies.” This could be a competitor or someone who has made moves that you feel is damaging to you. In this case, you would have to develop a strategy to deal with that person or group.</p>
<p>An example would be an agreement about child custody while in the process of a divorce that one side or the other feels is not fair. Or a question could arise over the value of the house or condo and whether it should be sold to comply with the divorce agreement or purchased by one party, perhaps to provide a stable place for the children to live during and after the divorce takes place.</p>
<p>Another way this could play out is that one partner (spouse) may want to have their parent come live with them due to extraordinary circumstances of the aged relative’s health, but the other person in the relationship does not agree to that plan, even though it would save considerable funds and place the aged, and perhaps ill, relative in a more loving atmosphere. I realize there are points to be made on either side in this matter.</p>
<p>An example in business might be if one partner wants to acquire property in order to move the headquarters to another location, perhaps another state or region (for tax incentives) that offers more space, but the business partner does not agree this is a good plan.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>The complexity of this month’s new moon shows how difficult it might be to decide any of these matters if one should come up.</p>
<p>This is a new moon in Leo—a new moon does not end things the way a full moon would, but rather opens a dialogue and, if you look, can provide you with various options. If any of these type examples resonates in your life, you have a chance to find a new remedy that more closely fits the needs of both parties.</p>
<p>Here is what is unusual about this new moon of August 16. Concurrently, while Uranus is in harsh angle to the new moon, it is also part of a band of planets that come together to work in supreme harmony—a grand triangle. This is a VERY complex new moon.</p>
<p>Uranus, from you fourth house of home and family, is well aspected to Pluto in Capricorn and Mars and Mercury in Virgo, which should give you the assurance and impetus to redress any situation you feel is unfair. You may find your efforts produce a surprise twist to the matter. You would have to work with a lawyer, but that could be a costly process. There is no predestination in astrology—you get to decide what you want to do under the set of aspects in play at the time.</p>
<p>As said, Uranus in Taurus (first point of the triangle) will be in ideal angle to Mars and Mercury in Virgo (second point of the triangle), currently transiting in your eighth house of other people’s money. That is a hopeful sign. Perhaps the contract holds a clause where the other party will pay all legal bills if they lose the case. Or it might mean your own family will come together to give you the money you need to pay a lawyer to redress the situation. I am not sure where the help will emanate from, but you do have help.</p>
<p>The third point of the triangle holds Pluto in Capricorn, just one degree away from being in Aquarius. Pluto is already influencing your Sun sign due to its proximity to Aquarius. (This is doubly true if your birthday falls January 21-25.) As you see, you have Uranus in Taurus, Pluto in Capricorn, and Mars and Mercury together in Virgo, creating a golden triangle in the sky, standing by ready to help you if you need them. You would have to show the universe your intent, but you do have support if you activate those planets.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>On August 30, this month’s second full moon, called a blue moon, will be in Pisces. This is a tough full moon, and it will fall in your second house of personal earned income and spending. A financial matter is coming to a crest, and it looks like you will have to cover a previously made financial obligation by writing the check at this time.</p>
<p>Saturn, the tough taskmaster, will conjoin this full moon and oppose the Sun in your other financial house. If you look closely, the theme of bridging somewhat tight finances keeps running though many of the aspects this month. This is a temporary situation and will clear up in September.</p>
<p>Mars will move to Libra three days earlier than this second full moon on August 27, suggesting you are about to end all these financial matters. Libra is an air sign like your Aquarius Sun, and all of life will improve. You will be liberated from this heaviness of Mars in earthy Virgo, and you can turn the page to a new chapter.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>The month opens with a full moon in Aquarius and marks an important moment in your timeline. A matter of great personal importance is reaching culmination within five days of August 1. A relationship may be on your mind. A person you care about romantically may exhibit troubling inconsistencies or act in an out-of-character behavior. Matters related to housing or family may also be the topic of conversation.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>How you react depends on many factors—ultimately the choice will be up to you. If you are dating casually, you will not be affected, for this full moon will mainly be felt by Aquarians who are in love and committed to one another. Alternatively, it could affect you in a business situation with a close committed expert who works with you to mutual benefit—or in this case, not so much.</p>
<p>If you go through a troubling episode and you feel this is the last straw in a relationship where you are living together, you will contemplate a rapid move out to find a new apartment or house, no matter the obstacles. You may feel you need to hurry toward a decision, but keep in mind that Venus is retrograde and Mercury will soon be also (August 23), so facts will be unclear.</p>
<p>Venus rules your home space, and Mercury rules jointly held money, so a rush to judgment would not be wise at this time. Venus will turn direct September 3, and Mercury will follow on September 15. For now, if you are in doubt about what to do, do nothing until the second half of September. By then you will have additional facts on which to base a decision.</p>
<p>If you are not getting along with your partner near the full moon August 1, or even later in the month, the main reason could be about money. Feisty Mars is currently in your eighth house of jointly held funds, and on August 22 Mars will oppose Neptune, making money matters cloudy. It would be easy to make assumptions, but again, don’t rush—you might be wrong in your perception. Mercury will turn retrograde the next day (August 23 to September 15), and this situation will likely need more study. Stay calm and seek to quietly study the facts.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>Another way this full moon of August 1 may manifest is that you may want to move, but your partner may resist and not see any reason to pull up stakes. You will need time to rally your partner to your side and see the benefits of such a move.</p>
<p>By the new moon, August 16, although there could be conflict, you seem ready to speak more calmly to a partner and sort out what is to be done to improve matters. Getting to an agreement with your partner will become a little easier than it had been in the first two weeks, so broach the subject again in the days that follow this new moon. If finances have been a sensitive spot in talks, you can get to a better solution. Family may even be of help at this time.</p>
<p>When the second full moon of the month appears on August 30 in Pisces, the matter will be nearing a final conclusion. Saturn will be close to that full moon, so you will need to be practical and accept what “is” rather than what “could be.” You seem to have to pay for something you had agreed to do much earlier, and there will be no getting around it. That full moon could mark a somber moment.</p>
<p>Financial dealings with your banker, spouse, or family over a property will improve, too. This August 30 full moon in Pisces could have the power to show you the path to a solution and to finally move you to a happier phase.</p>
