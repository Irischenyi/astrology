        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>This month starts off slowly. Mars is still in Virgo in a hidden, private part of your chart. When Mars moves to Libra on August 27, life will go from peaceful to full throttle, and you will have rare control over events. For now, you will have time to breathe and enjoy life throughout most of August.</p>
<p>Mars has not visited your sign, dear Libra, for two years, and once Mars enters your sign on August 27, to stay until October 11, you will find yourself in your most important part of 2023.</p>
<p>Your ruler Venus is still retrograde too, and this is another reason your progress will remain slow, but this will change once Venus goes direct on September 3.</p>
<p>This is excellent timing, for by early September, Venus and her cosmic lover Mars will be helpful to you. After weeks of being retrograde, Venus in Leo will go direct on September 3—a divine sign for you because Venus will still be in your friendship sector and will stir up lots of social activity next month. (Although Venus is in Leo now, she is weak in retrograde, so your friends may have been preoccupied, distracted, or generally unavailable.) Venus will be very helpful to you from September 3 to October 8.</p>
<p>After Venus goes direct on September 3, she will stay in Leo until October 8, and your life will grow brighter. Venus is your ruler and will be more effective in her job of protecting and helping you. Venus will reside in your friendship-oriented eleventh house of social activity, so your calendar will fill up with fun things you’ll look forward to doing.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>Your eleventh house, where Venus is based, rules your hopes and wishes, so something you dearly want to happen could materialize if you decide to work toward this goal. You will be set off on a new two-year cycle on August 27 when Mars moves into Libra, your first house of personality, identity, and style. Leo and Libra are a fabulous duo since Leo is a fire sign and Libra is an air sign—they blend together beautifully.</p>
<p>Venus will remain in Leo and will be strong from September 3 until October 8, and Mars will be in Libra from August 27 to October 11. It is amazing how these two planets will overlap for your benefit. With Mars in Libra, you will soon be moving at the speed of light—a strong reason you should relax in August while you can before this busy trend starts. For now, delays and postponements will benefit you in August.</p>
<p>Once Mars is in Libra (from August 27 to October 11), you will have a major advantage. You will have courage, energy, and drive, and you will not take “no” for an answer. Your passion will be able to light nations to your cause. Others will want to follow you, hoping some of your glitter will fall on them. If you have an idea you are dying to share, you will have no trouble getting the ear of a VIP to listen and possibly help you materialize your ambitions. Socially, Mars will make you more attractive and raise your profile, and if you are single, you will find your magnetism works wonders.</p>

        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>There is a glitch, but it’s a small one. Mercury is due to go retrograde in Virgo from August 23 to September 15. Since Mercury will be in the sign it rules, Virgo, Mercury’s influence will be strong. As you see, Mercury retrograde will also cut into some of your special time with Mars in Libra next month, but there is nothing we can do about that. (We are all in the same boat—Mercury will affect everyone in similar ways.) The upside is that you will have more time to prepare for everything on your to-do list in September, so simply stay patient until September 15, and begin then—Mars in Libra will give you a competitive edge. Schedule your biggest initiations for a few days after September 15.</p>
<p>So where does all of this leave you in August? As I said at the start of your report, this is a slow, leisurely month, and you will have time to do all the things you rarely have the chance to enjoy. Let’s take a closer look now.</p>
<p>The full moon on August 1 will greet you in the perfect sign for you, Aquarius, 9 degrees, filling your sector of truelove (fifth house). This could be your most romantic moment of the month. This full moon will be influential for days as it wanes, covering all the days from August 1 through (and including) Saturday, August 5. You might have a beautiful private dinner with your sweetheart or spouse, or you could even take a short trip together. Plan a romantic surprise for your partner. If you have a child or children, they can be part of the fun over this joyous full moon too—include them by lining up activities that would delight them. If you have been trying to have a baby, this full moon might bring welcome news.</p>
<p>To thicken the plot, but not in a helpful way, Uranus in Taurus will square Venus in Leo at this time, and Uranus has a key role during this full moon. You may find that an event you are invited to attend during this full moon period may be too expensive to participate in, so you may decline the invite. Uranus will be receiving sparkly vibrations from your home sector, however—so if you are terribly disappointed, call your mother or father (or another family member) who might help you out with some of the cost.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>One other person may be standing ready to help you with money matters. On the same day as the full moon on August 1, action Mars will present in perfect trine to happiness planet Jupiter, a rare and elegant aspect that typically happens once a year and is known to be favorable for actions leading to profit. You currently have good-fortune Jupiter in your eighth house of other people’s money, and Mars refers to your partner—the person who may offer a solution at this time.</p>
<p>Your spouse or established romantic partner might volunteer to help you because he or she will understand the value you see in going to this event or using their money to grasp your heart’s desire in a different area.</p>
<p>Alternatively, there is another way this Mars-Jupiter trine on August 1 (influential for three days) could present itself. You may hear happy news about your finances at the start of the month. This money would potentially come to you because it was owed to you or thanks to a breakthrough at your job. Having cash on hand will give you options, and that’s what everyone likes.</p>
<p>The middle of the month, August 16, brings a new moon in Leo, 23 degrees, your eleventh house of friendships, acquaintances, and social events. A new moon will provide opportunity in whatever part of your chart it falls, and in this case, it will offer you more social activity. You may be invited to a charity fundraiser, a friend’s wedding, or a special convention that will teach you more about your industry, or you may have a chance to take a seminar that will allow you to chat with friends and competitors in your field. Whenever people gather for a single purpose, that’s an eleventh house activity—the house that will be so lit up for you on August 16.</p>
<p>In this case, the August 16 new moon would give you reasons to go out and have more enjoyable interactions with lots of new people. You will have a chance to make new friends and contacts. You might also want to do work for a charity, humanitarian, or community effort, or you could join a political organization to help a candidate get elected.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>Uranus will again be a problem during this new moon on August 16 for Uranus will harshly square the Sun, new moon, and your ruler Venus, all in one step. Uranus is in your financial sector, so another unexpected expense will arise. For example, if a friend wants you to attend a destination wedding—sure to be expensive—you might say you are sorry (you are likely watching your spending), that you simply cannot make it work and cannot go.</p>
<p>You’ve had enough financial surprises from the recent eclipses in the Taurus-Scorpio family of signs that have been coming by every six months, in pairs two weeks apart, since November 19, 2021. You appear to have reversed this trend of continual monetary surprises—this year you have Jupiter in your financial (eighth) house, so you seem determined to not let yourself slip into that kind of situation again. Besides, you want to save and build wealth—and you can.</p>
<p>Over the last two years, unexpected expenses have come up frequently and rattled you, but you only have one more eclipse in this series on October 28, and then not again for nine years. (The coming full moon lunar eclipse in October will be a mild one and will conjunct Jupiter, so you may even be sent a generous sum at that time.) You seem to have figured out how to deal with life’s financial ups and downs, and that will be evident this month.</p>
<p>We now arrive at this month’s second full moon—a blue moon—this time falling on August 30 in Pisces, 7 degrees. This full moon will conjunct Saturn and will fall in your sixth house of health and work assignments. It will be vital that you take extra good care of yourself to avoid a virus or any other health difficulty. If you are prescribed medicine, don’t forget to take it. Do everything right.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>You may be acting against a deadline on August 30, or within five days of this full moon, bringing you to September 4, and it may wear you down a bit. You might be working too hard and not sleeping enough. Saturn can bring depression, but this is often due to too little sleep and forgetting to eat—you will need to fortify yourself to meet this full moon.</p>
<p>Happily, Neptune will reach out in a friendly way to both the surprise planet Uranus and transformative Pluto, which can restore you to strength if you partner with these planets. There is no predestination in astrology, so you would need to show Uranus and Pluto you would welcome their help. How? By showing them you care about your health—they will swing into action if you do.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may have a staffing problem and need to hire someone to help you at the office or at home, but with Mercury retrograde, I would suggest hiring early in August (as soon as possible) or after September 15.</p>
<p>I know—August will have its moments, especially due to Mercury retrograde, so go with the flow. Glowing days are coming very soon!</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>In August, find ways to treat yourself to some peaceful time off. The full moon on August 1 (plus four days) could prove highly romantic. Venus, your ruling planet, will remain retrograde (in a rare trend) until September 3. Single people looking to date someone new will be susceptible to Venus retrograde, but if you are already dating, married, or seriously attached, you will not have problems with Venus.</p>
<p>Under this fantastically vibrant, romantic full moon, if you are attached, plan some simple, fun activities that won’t break the bank. You won’t need to spend a lot to enjoy quality time together. Single Libras must wait until the second half of September to begin socializing and for a chance to meet someone special who you would like to know better.</p>
<p>Mercury will retrograde from August 23 until September 15, so August will be ideal for sitting back and not pushing matters forward on any front. No matter how anxious you are to see progress, pressing others to make a decision won’t work, and even if it does, any agreement made now would be flawed.</p>
<p>We strongly notice the planets that orbit closest to Earth when retrograde—Mercury, Venus, and Mars. As you’ve seen, Venus is already retrograde, and Mercury will turn out of phase on August 23. Alas, you won’t make headway on business or even important pressing personal matters until later next month, but you have time to prepare yourself now.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>The pace of this month will remain unusually slow until August 27. This may be just fine with you, as you have been working hard and need to take a break. Mars will enter Libra for the first time in two years from August 27 to October 11, giving you enviable control over events in all areas of life. Making more money has been a key priority for you, and fortunately, planets will be rallying around you to help you in your quest.</p>
<p>One of the best new moons of the year will occur next month on September 14, so watch what happens after it appears. Wait until Mercury goes direct on September 15, and then go after new clients or ask for a raise. If your company cannot give you a raise or improved benefits (also worth significant money), then look at your options.</p>
<p>A work project will need to be finished within five days of the full moon on August 30 (with the deadline no later than September 4). This full moon will conjunct Saturn and oppose the Sun, so the weight of responsibility will be on your shoulders, and you may feel drained by the experience. Stay the course by following excellent health habits because Saturn is known to require extra rest when conjoined to the Sun, as is the case at this full moon on August 30.</p>
<p>Overall, your chances to enjoy romance are a little lackluster this month. Venus, the planet of love, beauty, and fun, is retrograde until September 3. You will feel this retrograde a little more strongly than others because Venus is your ruler. Venus’ job is to care for you, but when she is sleeping in retrograde, you don’t have access to her powers.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>You are lucky that Venus rarely retrogrades, only every 18 months for six weeks, whereas other signs deal with their rulers being out of phase much more often. Venus will stay in Leo, a sign very compatible with yours, and after Venus turns direct, she will return to strength in this sign from September 3 to October 8.</p>
<p>Additionally, once Mars enters Libra on August 27, Mars will boost your attractiveness and charisma and work well with Venus once she redirects her orbit. All indications point to September and the first week of October to enjoy your best tenderhearted moments. Be patient, dear Libra—love could be coming. The full moon that kicks off the month on August 1 could be enchanting in a romantic sense—let’s hope it turns out to be magical for you.</p>
