        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>When you enter August, you will instantly come upon a full moon on August 1. It will fall in Aquarius, 9 degrees. This will light your eleventh house of friendships, acquaintances, and contacts. You may be reuniting with a few (or several) friends and business contacts you’ve not spoken to in weeks, or months.</p>
<p>In fact, you may be invited to a special event in August’s first week that you are looking forward to attending, most likely happening between August 2 and August 5, still within the full moon’s reach. It could be a party, wedding, baby shower, convention, seminar, community event, or charity fundraiser—an event that would draw many people together for the same purpose.</p>
<p>Uranus will be the most important planet at this full moon, and it will be trine Pluto, a rare and fabulously positive conversation between two heavy-duty planets. (These two planets won’t make an exact trine aspect until 2026 and 2027, but they are slow-moving and already close enough to be mathematically significant—you will feel this.) This sets up a powerful link between Pluto in your tenth house of career and Uranus in your second house of earned income. This tells me you are on quite a powerful trajectory of career success, starting now and extending for many years.</p>
<p>I feel a little look into future years may be helpful. Next year, 2024, Pluto will leave your tenth house and enter your friendship sector (eleventh house), and by 2026, Uranus will move to Gemini. Pluto will go back to your house of fame, your tenth sector, for a brief period next year (under three months) from September 1, 2024, to November 19, 2024, and that will be the last time in your life you will have Pluto in Capricorn. When Uranus moves to Gemini in 2026, he will stay for seven years.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>Don’t be sad—Pluto in Aquarius and Uranus in Gemini, both air signs, will benefit you even more. You are a fire sign, and planets in air will make the environment around you more to your liking. You will start to make successful, influential new friends in high places who can help you advance your career. As time progresses, you will see your good, close friends grow into better and more powerful positions, as will you, and they would be able to help you, too.</p>
<p>Your eleventh house, where Pluto will be headed and will remain for the lion’s share of the coming 20 years, is also called your house of hopes and wishes. I feel during this long, nearly 20-year period of being helped by two major planets in air, you will capture a dream dear to your heart. It’s onward and upward for you, dear Aries.</p>
<p>Coming back to the full moon in Aquarius on August 1, something else wonderful is happening, and it involves your ruling planet Mars.</p>
<p>Mars has been moving through Virgo, so there is no doubt you have been working harder than any time in recent memory. Mars is in your sixth house of work projects and personnel who report to you, and you may be busy hiring people. If you can’t hire help, you may feel overwhelmed. In that case, see if you can delegate or break duties down into smaller tasks.</p>
<blockquote><p>All the hard work you put in during July and so far in August is about to pay off. You are on your way up.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>You may look at your friends’ Instagram, seeing one being carefree in Paris, another driving along a scenic road in Switzerland, and a third friend shopping in London. Or your friend may be sitting in a café in San Francisco or New York, and looking at those photos, you may wish you were there. You will get your turn—not now, but in time—so don’t be sad. This is the hardest working August you’ve seen in years, and it all started the day Mars entered Virgo on July 10.</p>
<p>Here is the good news: This strenuous period will end when Mars enters Libra on August 27. Things will quickly simmer down and feel less burdensome after the end of this month.</p>
<p>Here is more good news. Mars, currently in your work-a-day project sector, will reach out to good-fortune Jupiter in your second house of earned income on August 1 as well. This is an aspect that usually happens once a year. Sometimes Mars speaks to Jupiter in a heavenly trine position (like now) as often as two times a year, and occasionally Mars will skip a year and not speak to Jupiter at all. You will love this aspect on August 1 because you will see evidence that your hard work is earning you a lot of admiration from higher-ups. When Mars speaks to Jupiter in such a harmonious way (a trine), it means actions lead to profits and happiness.</p>
<p>I should remind you that Venus will still be retrograde, a backslide Venus entered into on July 22, and will not go direct until September 3. As I wrote last month, this would not be a favorable time to start a new romantic relationship. Venus rules love as well as good looks, so hold off seeing your dermatologist for Botox or fillers. Don’t schedule plastic surgery or cosmetic dental work, and at the salon, you can have trims, but do not ask for a radically new hairstyle or color. Keep to the status quo.</p>
<p>Mercury will be retrograde August 23 to September 15. Clients and VIPs (whose approvals you need to green light a project) will be out of reach or maddeningly indecisive. Hold off on signing a contract—you may regret the terms later. Also, do not buy any machines, such as a new car, or electronics—camera, smart phone, or laptop (as examples)—wait until after September 15, or if you desperately need it, do so in August’s first 10 days.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>Now let’s move on to a sterling string of days, beginning with Wednesday, August 9, when Jupiter and Mercury will also be in a magical trine, a very sweet aspect. Mercury is a travel planet, and Jupiter brings happiness and luxury—this would be a great time to take a quick trip, if you can, and to spend some time out of town into the weekend. The transiting moon will be in highly compatible air-sign Gemini, which will make your fire element burn more brightly. Gemini is a travel sign, too. Additionally, the upcoming weekend favors relaxation with Venus conjoining the Sun. A luxury dinner out would boost your spirits.</p>
<p>The new moon comes next—August 16—in Leo, 23 degrees. This new moon could bring mixed results. Uranus will be in hard angle to the Sun, and the Sun, as the ruler of Leo, is the leading celestial body at this new moon. This could bring a large expense you do not see coming. It might be related to your physical home, property you may rent, own, buy, or want to sell, or it may have to do with your child or another family member. If you do not get news of a large expense, you might have a problem with a romantic relationship or something related to a creative project. If so, this problem will likely come out of left field.</p>
<p>On the plus side, at the time of this August 16 new moon in Leo, you will have more evidence that you are simply rolling along beautifully, collecting bushels of kudos for work well done at the office. A rare golden triangle will appear, linking Pluto in Capricorn, orbiting in your prestigious tenth house of professional honors, to Uranus in Taurus, occupying your second house of earned income, to Mars in Virgo, your sixth house of work-a-day duties and projects. All these planets are in earth signs, a message to you that you will do best by staying stay practical and realistic (this is not a month to show blue-sky vision—staying levelheaded wins the day) in all decisions you make at work. If you do, you will shine brightly in your career. Your entire chart is telling me that all the hard work you put in during July and so far in August is about to pay off!</p>
<p>As you get close to month’s end, you will encounter the month’s second full moon (known as a blue moon) on August 30 in Pisces, 7 degrees. If you can take a few days off at this point, do so—it appears you will be in strong need of rest. This full moon will conjoin Saturn, so you may feel a little dark cloud has moved over your head—if so, that cloud will leave soon, so don’t assume you are seeing life as it will be from now on. Not at all! In fact, you may be a little too pessimistic at this time. Don’t be.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>This is a deflating aspect (Saturn conjunct the full moon and in direct opposition to the Sun) made worse if you have not given yourself enough nutrition or sleep. You must eat more protein to keep your strength, and you also need calcium, as Saturn will leach the calcium out of your bones. Everyone will feel this August 30 full moon in a similar fashion, so don’t feel singled out. You might want to spend a little time alone or with those you hold most dear, but do not have a demanding social or travel schedule.</p>
<p>As strange as this sounds, this tough full moon of August 30 has more evidence that you are impressing higher-ups at work. You may doubt me, but you can’t doubt the mathematics between planets in aspect that I see in your chart. The universe runs on time!</p>
<p>This full moon will be managed mainly by Neptune (Pisces’ ruler), which will reach out to powerhouse Pluto in your fame sector and to Uranus (planet of surprise) in your earned income sector in a highly friendly way—yet another aspect that tells me you are on your way up. Neptune is in your twelfth house, very close to being on the cusp of your first house, and feeding your subconscious with superb fresh, bright ideas. Write them down when they come—they will be gifts from the angels.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Friends may be on vacation, but you will be at the office. Things are popping there, and all hands will be needed on deck. Pluto has moved out of Aquarius and back to Capricorn. This means you can now take on quite a leadership role at work and score major professional victory in that time. You are, or soon will be, paid handsomely with a salary or fee commensurate with your growing status.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>Venus recently went retrograde on July 22 and will remain in a lackadaisical position until September 3. A past love may come into your life, and if so, go slowly, even if you’re happy to see your former partner. There was a reason you broke up, so protect your heart—until you address that reason you parted, you can’t move forward with a fresh slate if that’s what you desire.</p>
<p>Communication will be blurred this month for Mercury, the planet in charge of clear discourse, will be retrograde from August 23 until September 15. Venus and Mercury both orbit close to earth (along with Mars), and these are the planets we feel the most when out of phase.</p>
<p>The entire tempo of August will be leisurely for other people, although you will be working hard back at the office. Yet there will be a blinking yellow light of caution about rushing to announce a decision about your future actions. Double-check all facts first, and wait until later to move forward. Not until Mars moves into Libra (August 27) as well as Mercury going direct (September 15) will anything happen.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you won’t miss out socially, for at the start of the month, the full moon of August 1 in Aquarius will give you a perfect reason to plan a get-together with your closest friends. It may be that you will go to a simple, intimate dinner with two friends having a fun dinner outdoors out under the stars, or you may be attending a much larger dress-up affair. On the other hand, in early August you may sign up for a special seminar or conference or be drawn to a humanitarian project as a volunteer. Any of these options would be a fine way to use this energy.</p>
<p>The full moon will be felt from August 1 to August 5.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>More options to socialize will come up at the new moon in Leo on August 16, but with Venus retrograde, and Mercury about start his nap as well, you might reconsider attending and simply want to stay home and save money. If you hope to meet a new romantic interest, it would be best to wait. Your horoscope suggests that the cost of participation could turn out to be much more expensive than you initially estimated. Although the new moon August 16 might help you meet a new romantic interest, with Venus retrograde, the outlook is not bright, for that the union would likely not have longevity.</p>
<p>Your work life is glowing, and you seem to be impressing everyone in your path. Put your energies into your work, and professional accolades and financial rewards will come to you.</p>
<p>You seem to have a strenuous schedule, and by the full moon of August 30, you may feel depleted and in need of rest. This full moon will be conjunct Saturn—an indication of exhaustion. Knowing this in advance, keep strengthening your health throughout August by eating right, and make a deliberate effort to get the rest you need.</p>
<p>It is also likely that a close, loved female relative—your mother, grandmother, aunt, or sister—will need your tender attention. If you can make a visit, do go to see her. At the least, a caring phone call would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>This is a month where most people—not only you—will feel a bit in limbo. Venus turned retrograde on July 22 and will go direct on September 3. Venus is tied to beauty, luxury, money, lavish parties, and all things that embellish—precious gems, expensive perfume, fine wines and gourmet foods, imported chocolates, fine cosmetics, expensive floral displays, designer clothes, and other beautiful parts of life.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>Venus also rules cosmetic surgery, Botox, fillers, and cosmetic dentistry. It’s best to avoid spending large amounts in these areas until next month.</p>
<p>Of course, Venus also rules love, and Venus retrograde is not the time to meet someone new. It is not good to begin (“give birth”) to a new relationship under a weak, languishing, debilitated Venus. If you are married, you are not affected as you met at a time when Venus was not out of phase.</p>
<p>Adding to the slowdown of all things governed by Venus will soon be compounded by Mercury retrograde from August 23 to September 15. I suggest you get everything important that needs to be done early on—I would say in the first two weeks of August—before August 16.</p>
<p>Mercury rules contracts, decision making, negotiation, writing, speaking, editing, and coding, as well as the post office and all courier and delivery services and transportation. Here in the US, in Hollywood we have a writer’s strike, and UPS delivery service may go out on strike (350,000 workers)—those industries are ruled by Mercury. Nothing of substance will happen until after September 15.</p>
<p>You can go back to former situations when Mercury and Venus are retrograde, but it’s best not to start anything new in the area that these two planets rule.</p>
