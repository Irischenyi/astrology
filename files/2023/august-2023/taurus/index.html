        <p>The minute you enter August, you may find something important is going on in your career. If you look up to the sky at night, you will see a big tender full moon, as big as a pizza pie. That full moon will be in the constellation of Aquarius at 9 degrees. When a full moon orbits closer to earth, or its perigee, it is called a supermoon, and it will appear larger in the sky.</p>
<p>We had a supermoon last month on July 3. In addition to the one on August 1, there will be a third supermoon on August 31. The final one—the fourth in the 2023 series—will arrive on September 29. Some astrologers feel your emotions are more pronounced during a supermoon. I am skeptical and feel more research should be done. I do hear from friends, however, that on a full moon supermoon they sometimes find it harder to sleep.</p>
<p>I feel it is more important to know where any full moon will fall in your chart and in what degree, so I suggest you watch all the full moons this year and see if you notice anything different about the one supermoon that arrived last month on the July 3 and note what happens on the two supermoons this month. Life is a laboratory, and we can do continual research.</p>
<p>Anyway, this full moon of August 1 should bring welcome progress to your career. If you have been working hard, this full moon will bring you recognition and applause for work well done. However, Uranus will conflict (square) with Venus, your ruler. As Uranus is the planet of surprises (but this time not a good one), you may have something come up unexpectedly that you will have to attend to and fix. It might be an expense, but in truth, it could be almost anything.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>Yet Uranus and powerhouse Pluto will be in a heavenly trine at this time, and as this is a very strong and exceedingly rare aspect, I feel you may gain good money from work done, or you may make more money due to a possible promotion. As you see, things are mixed, but I feel you will land sunny-side up.</p>
<p>Note to professional astrologers: This is not an exact trine between Uranus and Pluto but within 3-1/2 degrees, which is significant. These two planets are gradually moving into a perfect trine in deep space by July 2026, extending to May 2028, then not again in this heavenly aspect until December 2063.</p>
<p>The very best part about the first week of August is the supreme interplay between Jupiter, the good-fortune planet, in Taurus, and Mars, the action planet, in Virgo—your house of true love. They are in exact degree, sure to rev up your social life, and if you are open to love, your romantic life, too.</p>

        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>If you are single, you may meet someone you will want to know better, but be careful because your ruler Venus is currently retrograde until September 3. You probably would have problems getting together this month, and that’s good—delays will benefit you. Whether you are male or female, be independent—go on a trip on your own. Be a little hard to reach but still friendly. Starting a new relationship with Venus retrograde is not favorable for long-term happiness.</p>
<p>You might hear from an old flame during Venus retrograde, and if so, you can see whether to make a go of things because you most likely met when Venus was not retrograde. It is always good to go back to the past during Mercury, Venus, or Mars retrograde (to be clear, Mars will not be retrograde, thank goodness). Do not rush—keep everything the same tempo throughout the month, slow and steady.</p>
<p>Venus will be fine by September 3, but Mercery will go retrograde this month and overlap with Venus. Mercury rules your solar second house of earned income, so you may be watching how you spend your pennies closely all month. If someone owes you money, it may get delayed a bit.</p>
<p>Mercury goes retrograde every twelve and a half weeks, and this time Mercury will be in the sign it rules, Virgo, making this Mercury retrograde stronger. On top of that, Mercury also naturally rules Taurus’ solar fifth house of true love, which is where Mercury will be in August. Indeed, this is more evidence that this month is NOT the month to start a new relationship. Wait until after September 15 when Mercury goes direct (and add a space of a few days).</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>Whether you have been married a few years or a long time, you will not be affected by Venus retrograde. Your marriage is ruled by another part of your chart, not the fifth house, which is getting so much attention. Your marriage, ruled by the seventh house, should stay sound.</p>
<p>After you get through the August 1 prestigious-career-and-reputation full moon (which will take you to August 5), you will want to take a break from work. Ever since July 10 when Mars entered Virgo—a divinely romantic place for Mars to be for you—you’ve wanted more time off. If fact, you may have had a hard time concentrating at work. Mars will remain in this sweet spot for your love life until August 27.</p>
<p>This placement of Mars will give you more time with your children (or a child you love of a family member or friend) and also more time to devote to your personal creative projects.</p>
<p>On August 1, as I mentioned earlier, Mars and Jupiter will be in gorgeous sync—an aspect I particularly love—and you can alternatively use this energy for starting or selling a creative idea. When Jupiter is invited to the party, he always brings money—in this case, that money would be there for you if you make an effort.</p>
<p>Once Mars moves into Libra, August 27, you will again need to hit the ground running at work and at home too, with many tasks to be done. You may even need to hire someone to help you. Don’t be blue about the prospect of working hard again at the office in September. Next month will also have a nice influence on romance, due to the new moon in Virgo on September 14, which will enliven your social life again for many weeks. Mercury will go direct the following day, September 15.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>By then everything will go better. I feel you will have a better work-life balance in September. Venus will go direct September 3, and once that happens, life will instantly improve as you are ruled by Venus! The joys of life will return. Venus won’t retrograde again for 18 months.</p>
<p>Now let’s talk about the new moon August 16 in Leo, 23 degrees, which will switch your full attention to your family or to property you own or rent, or want to sell or buy. If the emphasis is on family, you will be thinking about one of your parents, and you will either need to do something for them or want to go see them.</p>
<p>If you are in a disagreement with a parent over a business deal, there could be another shock coming mid-month, and I am so sorry to have to give you this information. Uranus, the planet of surprises, now in Taurus (23 degrees) will be in very hard angle to the Sun, new moon (23 degrees) and to Venus, your ruler (18 degrees). Three of these heavenly bodies—Sun, moon, and Venus—are in Leo. If all your attention is instead on your home, you may move, renovate, do extensive repairs or maintenance, or sell a piece of property.</p>
<p>But wait, there is good news about the new moon of August 16, too. In the background, you have a golden triangle mid-month, just after the new moon in Leo on August 16, linking Jupiter in Taurus, Mars and Venus in Virgo, and Pluto in Capricorn. This leads me to think you are likely to take a very long trip, most likely overseas. The trip will work out to be warm, comforting, fun, and exciting, even though you may have concerns about a parent or other relative at the same time.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>The second full moon of the month—a blue moon—will come on August 30 in Pisces, 7 degrees, and will conjunct Saturn. Saturn will give this full moon a serious, somber tone for everyone not just you, dear Taurus. You may be worried about the welfare of a female friend or a domestic situation in your own life, which initially may be hard to deal with.</p>
<p>This full moon will appear in your eleventh house of friendship, and it will be some of your friends who will give you admiration and support as you deal with the situation that comes up at this full moon.</p>
<p>Friends will want to care for you and offer wise advice, so listen to what they have to say. Saturn will oppose the Sun, a deflating vibration, and could cause you concern about the health or welfare of your father or mother, or there may be a situation involving a family question or disagreement. Make sure you get enough sleep and nutritious food at this point of the month, for if you don’t, you might feel overwhelmed. This is not an easy full moon, but let’s hope it brings a situation to a culmination so that you can finally make a decision and put it to rest.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>This month is full of riddles: On one hand, romantically, you’re craving attention, affection, and romance, but at the same time, your ruler and planet of love, Venus, is in a weak state. Venus started to retrograde last month on July 22 and will remain so until September 3. Mercury, which rules your house of true love, will retrograde from August 23 to September 15. If you feel the universe is sending you mixed, conflicting messages, you are correct.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>If you are single, these planets are doing you no favors—it would be better to search for love in the second half of September, which will be a fine time for a vacation. A new relationship will have a better chance of clicking after September 15 than it would now.</p>
<p>If you are married or happily attached, these planets will not hold you back because committed relationships are covered by a different part of the horoscope. That means if you are attached, you soon will be able to give your partner quality time, so plan something magical.</p>
<p>You are likely to get important career news within five days of August 1 when the Aquarius full moon will appear. Uranus will be supportive of this full moon, so a surprise professional opportunity may materialize. If you are creative, Neptune will signal Uranus in a friendly way, so during this full moon period, your creativity will be lauded and prized and will play a big part of your success.</p>
<p>The new moon on August 16 could bring an unexpected development in regard to your residence or other property you own or rent. Or it may instead bring news about a relative that will need your assistance, advice, or attention. Costs involved will determine how you proceed, as financials appear to play a major part in most decisions you will make this month.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>As a Taurus, you are known to be careful about remaining fiscally sound throughout life, the reason Taurus natives often amass quite a bit of wealth. Your slow, careful way to go about solving a dilemma often allows you to find an imaginative, creative solution that would escape others who act in haste.</p>
<p>At month’s end, August 30, we have a second full moon, when you may become aware that a friend is going through of a tough patch—you may be moved to help her. You might, for example, offer to cook dinners for her family or care for her small children while she takes time to adjust and find solutions to a difficult situation that may be emerging. Jupiter will be in fine angle to this full moon in Pisces, a helpful sign. Neptune, Pisces’ ruler, will be in fine angle to Uranus, so a non-traditional approach to her dilemma could prove to be the key. In the meantime, encourage your friend to think creatively.</p>
<p>At the same time as the full moon, August 30, Mars will have just moved into Libra (August 27), so a bustling business atmosphere at the office will distract you temporarily. You will need to be attentive to your duties at the office, but like a little homing pigeon, it looks like you will continually return to your friend’s side to help her, too.</p>
<p>Your sensitivity to her will become a major part of your personal growth in 2023. Others around you will notice your growing depth and maturity this month. In your horoscope, Uranus is the planet that rules your contribution to your work, your firm, and your industry, and this same house covers your professional reputation. Neptune, the planet of vision, creativity, and the arts, will be working in concert with Uranus. This indicates that a non-traditional approach to an artistic or high-tech project or problem (including Artificial Intelligence) will work exceptionally well, and if you contribute your idea, no matter how idiosyncratic it may seem to others at the start, could work—and later have you hailed as a rock star.</p>
