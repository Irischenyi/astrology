        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>You are the international travel sign, and you love to travel more than anything else in life. This month, while your friends will be posting photos of gorgeous settings in far-flung, exotic locations on Instagram, Threads, Twitter, or Discord, you would nevertheless be wise to stay home. It is hard to tell you this, knowing how travel is practically like oxygen to you—you love it so much. Rest assured, you will have a chance to go to any location you please in future months, just not now. If you were to pack up and go in August, you are likely to meet one frustration after another.</p>
<p>I will show you why travel would not bring either the joy or the business progress you imagine—there are several reasons, and I will give you all the details.</p>
<p>Your career is apparently on fire, and from every nook and cranny of your chart, aspects are promising breakthroughs. This is not commonplace. It would be a shame to take your eyes off the road when your professional planets are shining brighter than diamonds under the noon-day Sun.</p>
<p>As you enter the month, you will be greeted by a full moon (which is a supermoon this time, meaning it will look huge in the sky because it is orbiting closer to Earth than usual). This full moon will appear on August 1 and be influential for four days, until August 5. It will fall in Aquarius, 9 degrees, your third house of short-distance travel.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>This would normally allow you to hop in your car and travel to a nearby resort to enjoy a few days of fresh air and sunshine. However, Saturn will directly oppose Mercury, the travel planet, and this seems to prevent you from going away, but don’t feel bad—Saturn would fill any trip you take with delays and crosscurrents.</p>
<p>Uranus is the lead planet of the August 1 full moon, and it will be in hard angle to Venus in Leo, your ninth house of international travel. Venus is currently BASED in (visiting) your international ninth house, but we also have to look to the house Venus RULES—your sixth house of work-a-day projects where Uranus happens to be transiting. I feel that an important situation is bubbling up at work that will make you think twice about leaving town just when things are going so well.</p>
<p>Jupiter, your ruling planet, is in your assignment sector this year until May 25, 2024, and this suggests you are receiving the kind of attention on the job that you only used to dream about. If you are not, ask for the plum projects or persuade VIPs to give you a shot at them. If you have your own business, you may be receiving so many new assignments now, possibly from a prestigious client or two, that in coming months, you might be looking to hire staff. Again, you will be lucky, for this year you are likely to find stellar candidates who would fit perfectly into your organization.</p>
<blockquote><p>Jupiter, your ruling planet, is in your assignment sector until May 25, 2024, suggesting you are receiving the kind of attention on the job that you only used to dream about.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>This is usually the hardest part of running a business—finding the right employees with the perfect qualifications and backgrounds who you can also afford to hire, but this year is different from all other years. You can uncover gems. This is not a common advantage. Jupiter comes to this area of your chart for one year every 12 years, so you have the planet of good fortune now, and if you need people to help get a job out the door, by all means, start to interview candidates next month. (Why next month? I will answer this question in a moment.)</p>
<p>I am very excited to see that you still have Mars in Virgo, circulating at the very pinnacle of your chart—your prestigious tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement. It has been two years since you have had Mars’ help in this area, your most critical house for career progress and advancement. Mars will remain in this important career house until August 27.</p>
<p>Mars will be in a beautiful, harmonious trine to Jupiter that will coincidentally occur at the full moon on August 1. Mars in Virgo, your prestigious professional tenth house, will link to your ruler Jupiter in Taurus, your sixth house of assignments. This suggests you are about to receive an assignment that can elevate your profile in your company, industry, or even the world at large. This is a lovely aspect that only comes once a year, always in a different part of your chart, and it is one of my favorites. The fact that Jupiter, your ruling planet, is involved makes this configuration even stronger for you than for others. This aspect is too fabulous to miss and will be influential for three to four days.</p>
<p>There is another reason I wanted you to stay home and work on your career in August.</p>
<p>Virgo, your career tenth house, is ruled by Mercury, and as stated above, this house is found at the very highest point of your chart called the midheaven. Now I need to give you more information.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>From August 23 to September 15, Mercury will be retrograde in Virgo, your tenth house career center. As you’ve seen, Mars (also in Virgo) will work hard for you until August 27, so Mercury will cut into the time his brother Mars will be lighting your fame and honors sector. Mercury retrograde will officially start on August 23, but you will feel Mercury’s slowdown two weeks prior to the official day it turns retrograde.</p>
<p>If you play your cards right, you can still make August work for you. Retrograde planets urge us to look back, analyze past wins and losses, and think about the individuals in business who have believed in us and who have always supported us. Go back to these clients, colleagues, and individuals to thank them, perhaps over lunch at a popular restaurant, and discover new ways you can collaborate.</p>
<p>If you cannot find a logical way you can work together again right now, ask your client or colleague if they would make an important introduction for you or write you a letter of recommendation. This month, you will do far better with contacts from your past than you would with new people you meet.</p>
<p>You have a golden opportunity to move ahead in your career, and I want you to stay home and lay the groundwork. After Mars leaves Virgo—this special place for your professional advancement—Mars won’t be back here again for two years, but don’t be upset that Mercury retrograde in Virgo will add a confusing element. Go back to the people and firms that know you.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>Here is why you should be excited: The new moon in Virgo next month on Thursday, September 14, is glorious. It is one of my favorite new moons of all of 2023, and it will light this same tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement. On the following day, Friday September 15, Mercury will go direct.</p>
<p>The September 14 new moon will help you in such a big way, and not only in the ten days that follow this new moon’s appearance (its strongest period)—this new moon will continue to provide opportunities to you for the weeks and months to come. If you are ambitious and want to get ahead, the universe is standing by to help you. If you stay home in August, work with Mars—he will open doors for you and help you lay the groundwork to make the September 14 new moon in Virgo an even bigger opportunity for you. This is how you can work with astrology best, by partnering with the universe when you have great aspects. There is no predestination in astrology—you must show the universe your intent.</p>
<p>Coming back to this month, the new moon on August 16 in Leo, 23 degrees, would normally be the moment to start to travel far and wide before the seasons change. The problem is Uranus will be in an even worse position, on a rampage, challenging (in a square) the Sun, new moon, and Venus as they all move tightly together in your ninth house of travel.</p>
<p>Uranus is currently based in your work-a-day sixth house sector, which also rules your health. Either you will have too much going on at work to even think of leaving town or you might not feel well when you arrive at your destination. Uranus is unpredictable by nature, so it’s hard to forecast what Uranus will do—those are two examples. Additionally, the moon in your solar chart rules a financial house, so with the new moon under siege by Uranus near August 16, you could experience a loss or large expense. I hope you won’t.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>If you need to travel to see a client face-to-face to hammer out a deal during this wild and woolly month (more so after the new moon on August 16), you will likely find that taking a trip will not produce the results you had hoped for. Delay signing papers or making a handshake agreement until after September 15 (the day Mercury goes direct).</p>
<p>Your ninth house (the place of the troublesome August 16 new moon) also rules legal matters, publishing and broadcasting projects, your efforts to earn a degree in undergraduate or graduate school, matters of immigration (including passports, visas, and residency), import-export, and international relationships. Keep an eye on these areas, especially if one resonates with you regarding an ongoing situation. Instead of having a frustrating trip, you may have difficulty in one of the areas I just listed. I hope you don’t have any problems! I feel bad even suggesting this.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to another topic—Venus, and what this lovely planet is doing in August. Since July 22, Venus has been retrograde, and she will go direct on September 3.</p>
<p>Venus rules love, beauty, fun, luxury, and all things that embellish, such as beautiful jewelry. I wrote quite a bit about Venus last month (and you can always access my previous month’s forecast on my website—see the blue box at the bottom of each page of my report for you that says “View Previous Month.” On my award-winning app, Astrology Zone Horoscopes, available on the Apple App Store and Google Play, you can see last month’s forecast by simply swiping left when reading the current month.)</p>
<p>I will give you a short version of how to best work with Venus retrograde now.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>Venus will be out of phase throughout all of August until September 3, and when Venus retrogrades, she withholds her powers, making it impossible to access them.</p>
<p>This is not the right time to see your dermatologist for Botox or fillers, to have plastic surgery or cosmetic dentistry, or to ask your hair stylist to make a radical, dramatic change to your haircut or color. Nor is this the time to buy expensive jewelry or to throw a lavish party.</p>
<p>Single Sagittarians would do best to not have a first date until both Venus and Mercury go direct after September 15. Venus rules affection and warmth—the sparkling energy that usually starts a relationship—but with Venus retrograde, yours may start out exciting but cool down, possibly becoming too cold after a short time, making you wonder what happened. When you start a relationship, you give birth to it—the timing matters, and I want you to have only strong planets supporting your union.</p>
<p>Now we need to look at the full moon on August 30 in Pisces, 7 degrees. All full moons have an area of influence of four to five days beyond the date they appear. This full moon will conjunct Saturn, also in Pisces, and light your fourth house of home, which includes your vacation house or any other property you may own or rent. I know I am continually warning you about flooding and difficulties with water, dear Sagittarius, but this full moon concerns me.</p>
<p>This is another reason I don’t want you to travel—stay home near this time in case something happens related to water. My best friend Anna went to Europe on a business trip that lasted two weeks. The day after she returned home, feeling quite exhausted from traveling to several cities, her basement had flooded very badly. Imagine if no one had been there when it happened! She did call a maintenance man for help, but she had to do a lot herself to get things back to normal. (Anna has Sagittarius rising.) That came up last month.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>I am concerned that her basement problem is not fully fixed and that another challenge will surface with this August 30 full moon. It falls in watery Pisces and will be conjunct Saturn, the tough teacher-taskmaster planet. Also, the moon in your solar chart, dear Sagittarius, is always connected to your financial eighth house—suggesting you would have to spend a large sum to fix the problem. With Saturn pressing on this full moon, you and my friend may have another water-related expense.</p>
<p>Do all you can to avoid problems. Check your house for mold and for the purity of your drinking water. Bring valuables upstairs from your basement. If you live in a cold climate, make sure you don’t have too much snow accumulated on your roof—the weight of the snow could damage it.</p>
<p>If you live in a high-rise, you still can still have water problems. My superintendent found a pipe in my bathroom wall with a hole in it that caused a flood in the apartment above me two years ago. I live on the thirtieth floor in New York City.</p>
<p>Also, I once had a problem years ago when Hurricane Irene brought so much rain that it managed to seep through my living room windows, damaging my wood floors. The wind was so strong that the rain come in horizontally. My point is, this full moon on August 30 (plus five days of influence) can affect anyone, not just people who own or rent a house in the country, but readers in high-rise apartments, too.</p>
<p>If you have a swimming pool, make sure it is in excellent working order, and have a sturdy fence around it so children or pets cannot wander into it. August is the middle of hurricane season in the Northern Hemisphere, so know where you would go just in case you have to evacuate. And have a go-bag ready for every member of the family. As you can see, Saturn conjunct this full moon is serious.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>If water is not the problem, this could involve any liquids. Keep liquid cold medicines and other harmful fluids locked up and out of the reach of children.</p>
<p>If things do not affect your physical home or property, this full moon may bring a family matter to culmination. If your family has been squabbling, they may come to a final resolution, but you might not be enthusiastic about the result. Saturn is asking you to be practical and realistic.</p>
<p>With Saturn opposing the Sun and conjunct the full moon, your focus could be on a male or female relative. You might (or might not) be called into action. Saturn rules people of advanced age—you will need to take responsibility for this person’s welfare and care. Even though you may have sisters and brothers, you will likely be the one in the best position to help. You might want to keep in touch with your mother, father, or another close relative near this full moon. This is just one more reason I feel it is best for you to be home.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>This is a powerful month for initiating satisfying career progress. You still have Mars, the energy planet, heating up your career sector, a trend that started on July 10 and will continue until August 27. Mars will make it easier to get your foot in the door to see important people whose approvals you will need to advance. If you are self-employed, you may be drawing up plans to launch a new product or service or a new advertising or social media campaign, as some examples.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>This is simply Part One of a two-fold career effort—in August, Mars will help you prepare for Part Two next month when a gorgeous new moon on September 14 will bring the biggest boost of the year for your professional advancement.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Mercury, the planet that rules communication, negotiation, and sales, among other things, also governs your most important professional tenth house sector. When Mercury retrogrades from August 23 to September 15, you may temporarily see a slowdown on all fronts. This is normal. VIPs will be on vacation or traveling out of town for business, and the people who stay back at the office will be indecisive and hard to reach. Don’t press—let all matters take a natural course.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to see new people during Mercury retrograde, go back to clients and colleagues who have supported you in the past—in August, this will represent the best use of your time. Your chart is so strongly lit for career success, I doubt you will lose any time at all.</p>
<p>Mars in Virgo has laid the groundwork (July 10 to August 27), so if you use Mars’ energy effectively—by having conversations with people you know, meeting friendly competitors for lunch to get an overview of your industry, or working in other ways to improve your career standing—you will be ready for the most important phase, Part Two.</p>
<p>That will happen next month when the glorious new moon in Virgo on September 14—this same tenth house career sector—will likely open the door for you to a new job, which would represent a step up. You have Mars working for you in August, so plant your seeds now. The new moon on September 14 will help you to see solid offers.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>Mercury will be retrograde until September 15, so start looking in earnest no sooner than September 16. Any new moon will help you for weeks and months, but it will be strongest in the 10 days following its appearance. This new moon is very special, one of the best of 2023.</p>
<p>This month’s new moon on August 16 falls in your travel house but is quite flawed because Uranus, the planet of unexpected events, will be in hard angle to this new moon—travel will not be pleasant and could bring continual frustrations. There are many reasons to stay at home and tend to your emerging career opportunities.</p>
<p>Romantically, Venus is retrograde, a trend that started July 22 and will end September 3. At this time, Venus will withhold her greatest powers of warmth and affection. This will mainly affect single Sagittarians. If you are attached, you won’t be as affected by Venus retrograde because your relationship is ongoing and was likely started a long time ago. Singles should wait until next month to begin a new love interest, preferably after September 15, when Mercury goes direct.</p>
<p>This month holds a second full moon—a blue moon—on August 30 in Pisces, filling your home sector. You may be moving or dealing with some sort of problem with water, possibly a flood, mold, tainted drinking water, damage from having had too much snow on your roof during the winter (in the Southern Hemisphere)—you name it. This full moon will conjunct Saturn on August 30, suggesting you may have to address a water-related challenge.</p>
<p>Another way this full moon could unfold is that you’ll discover you’ve been approved for a mortgage and that you may soon be closing on a house. (Schedule this important move next month after September 15.) This full moon will give you a strong need for home-related stability and security. Alternatively, you may receive news that you will finally be able to buy a house or apartment you love—and it will be exciting to know you will soon be a bona fide homeowner. Bravo!</p>
