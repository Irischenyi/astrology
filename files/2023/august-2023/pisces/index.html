        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>As you begin August, you may feel strangely tired. Working so hard without any rest can lower your resistance. Sometimes your body will take over and make you rest. It could be something you ate, a virus you picked up from someone you know, or simply overwork, possibly on a current film, advertising, social media, or a writing or broadcast project that has many moving parts. Whatever caused this feeling does not matter—what does is that you need time alone to regroup and recharge.</p>
<p>The full moon that appears August 1 in Aquarius at 9 degrees is lighting your twelfth house, and it will be influential through the weekend of August 5-6. Hibernate a little. Take time to reflect on all you’ve accomplished so far this year, and make a mental list of all you still want to do, but also what you will look forward to doing the rest of the year.</p>
<p>Sometimes when a full moon occurs in the hidden twelfth house, a secret comes out in the open—something someone tried to keep from you.</p>
<p>This will be a slow month, for we now have four out of eight planets in retrograde, and by the end of the month six—Venus, Mercury (August 23), Saturn, Uranus (August 28), Neptune, and Pluto, and Jupiter is already slowing down in anticipation of his going retrograde on September 4. Because they are napping, none of these planets will give you access their greatest powers. The most important planets when retrograde are the ones that orbit close to earth—Venus and Mercury (and Mars, but he’s not going retrograde). Let’s talk about these two planets for a minute.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>Venus has been retrograding in your work-a-day sector since July 22 and will go direct on September 3. Venus rules love, romance, and the spark of new love. Venus also rules beauty, luxury, and all things that embellish, such as jewelry, beautiful lingerie, and expensive perfume. Venus also rules fun and parties, along with all the enjoyable parts of life. When Venus retrogrades, life becomes a little more serious, and we give up some of the fun parts for about six weeks.</p>
<p>I wrote a great deal about Venus retrograde last month, but briefly, August and part of September would not be the time to give a lavish, expensive party or to buy a piece of expensive jewelry. It is not the time to dramatically change your hair style (trims and good grooming are OK), nor is it a good idea to radically shift the color of your hair. Don’t visit your dentist for cosmetic work or your dermatologist for Botox or fillers until the second half of September. Keep to the status quo, for if you do things to change your appearance when Venus is retrograde, you may not like the results.</p>
<p>Single Pisces should not have a first date because the day you chose to begin dating your new partner is the date you “give birth” to the new relationship. You need to give a new relationship a good start with a strong Venus and not a debilitated one, as is the case now.</p>
<blockquote><p>At the new moon August 16, these areas will glow for you—partnership, friendships, quick short travel—and can combine to create happy experiences.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>Venus also rules profit, especially from products and services directed toward women. If you are in an industry that markets to women, be careful not to launch a product or service until next month or to begin an important adverting or social media campaign until the second half of September.</p>
<p>Now let’s talk about Venus’ brother Mercury, which is also about to go retrograde, from August 23 to September 15. Mercury will retrograde in Virgo, the sign it rules, making this coming retrograde period stronger and more noticeable. If you can, put off signing a contract until mid-September. If that is not possible, sign in the first half of August, but realize you will have Venus retrograde, and Venus is connected to profits and money. If you need a computer, car, smart phone, or anything with moving parts or electronic chips, get your product immediately in the first half of August, and do it as many days prior to August 23, the date Mercury goes retrograde, as you can, or wait until the second half of September. I always like to get expensive electronics AFTER Mercury is done retrograding. Plus, I always leave a space of a few days beyond.</p>
<p>If you feel you will lose an opportunity if your wait, such as not being able to sign a lease for a new apartment or verbally agreeing to accept a job, then take it immediately—you can always change later if things don’t work out as you had hoped. While it is not the best time to sign anything or commit to a new opportunity, we can’t always get life to cooperate.</p>
<p>With Venus and Mercury due to overlap their retrogrades shows you why I will urge you to resume normal life activities after September 15, allowing a space of a few days to about September 18.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to Mars—he is going to remain in Virgo, the place Mars entered last month on July 10, until August 27. This placement of Mars is putting a big emphasis on collaboration with others. Don’t try to control events, for others will want you to integrate their ideas into your thinking and future plans.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>By August 23 Mars and the Sun will both be in Virgo, on the other side of the sky, as far away from your Pisces Sun as possible. That means your partner(s) in life will take all your attention. You will get the most accomplished by listening to, and working with, a partner.</p>
<p>Once Mars moves into Libra on August 27, and the Sun moves into Libra September 23, you will gradually start to regain control. September is always your turning point as the Sun makes its loop around to return back toward the other side of the sky, and this year you have Mars joining in, too. You don’t have to wait until the end of February to feel more control as this is a gradual progress that will continually grow in strength.</p>
<p>With the Sun far from your sign, this makes late August and most of September your personal “winter” where the Sun is so far away from Pisces (six signs away) that you cannot feel the Sun’s warmth. The warmth you will feel at the end of August now will come from the friends and relatives who you will associate closely with—people who love you and want the best for you.</p>
<p>Why would you be fixated on your romantic or business partner in late August? You may be making plans to get engaged or wed later this year, and you may be checking with your partner to make sure he or she likes the plans you are making. Alternatively, your spouse may be making headlines in your life, changing the way he or she makes a living, or by starting a business. Any big changes in your spouse’s life would affect you, too.</p>
<p>In business, you may be working closely with your designer to redo your website, with your writing buddy to sharpen a screenplay, or with your agent to decide on goals you’d like to tackle in the coming months of 2023. These are just a few examples, and I know you can think of more.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>Sometimes Mars’ presence in a certain house of the horoscope—this month, that’s your partnership/marriage house—can stir the pot and bring conflict. I have not seen that to be true most of the time, but it can happen. If you and your spouse, live-in lover, or business partner have not been getting along since Mars entered this house on July 22, it may be because Mars is bringing an unresolved problem to the surface so that you will see it and discuss it in an effort to find new remedies that you had not thought to offer before. Mars is associated with money in the Pisces’ chart—look to that as the core of any difference of opinion or conflict you may be experiencing.</p>
<p>The month’s new moon will appear on August 16 in Leo, 23 degrees, and light your house of health and daily work projects. The Sun and new moon plus Venus will be in very hard angle to Uranus, the planet of all things unexpected, so if the assignment you are working on involves writing or speaking, you may have problems working on this project. Make sure you know what you need to accomplish if this project is for a client. Aim for clarity, because with so many planets retrograde (soon to include Mercury), communication may become garbled.</p>
<p>If the project does not have a lot of moving parts and requires a lot of concentration (possible), then you might have a serious computer problem. Back up your data now, just in case. Your communication sector (solar third house) holds Uranus, the plant of unanticipated, surprise developments (the reason your writing and speaking style is becoming so unique and creative—Uranus is supplying original and imaginative thinking). This month, however, Uranus, which rules the digital world, will be in hard angle to the Sun and new moon in Leo on August 16, the reason I worry about computer problems.</p>
<p>The third house also rules travel, so make sure if you set off on a road trip that your car is in good working condition. Have your mechanic check your car before heading out.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>There are also good aspects associated with this new moon, for powerhouse Pluto in Capricorn, your friendship sector, will send a golden beam to surprise planet Uranus in Taurus, your travel and communication house, and to Venus and Mercury, tightly found close together in Virgo, your collaboration/partnership house. All these areas will glow for you—partnership, friendships, quick short travel—and can combine to create happy experiences. Just realize you cannot always get your ideas approved in their purest form, not now, in your “winter” time of the year (as I described earlier). That may be fine—other people have good ideas too, so be open to them.</p>
<p>This new moon of August 16 may give you the time and impetus to schedule medical and dental routine screenings. Add the annual screenings, like having your eyes checked, too. A new moon in the sixth house is the perfect time to line up those appointments.</p>
<p>A full moon in Pisces, 7 degrees, on August 30, the month’s second full moon (called a blue moon) will bring on a somber moment or maybe a time you make a serious commitment.</p>
<p>You need to be very mindful of your health at this full moon and be sure to take good care of yourself. Saturn can make you feel overtired, overwhelmed, deflated, or sensitive to criticism, or have some fleetingly sad feelings. Those feelings will be more pronounced if you are tired from lack of sleep or not well nourished. Fortunately, those feelings will not last more than two or three days beyond August 30, and after that, those feelings would evaporate into the ether, leaving you to feel much better.</p>
<p>When Mars moves into Libra on August 27, you may be ready to spend a large sum, such as to hire a team to build an app, to outfit a home office, or to redo your website. It appears you will be investing in yourself in some way. Perhaps you will be paying a portion of your tuition to a university. Mars will be in your financial eighth house, which also rules bank loans, mortgages, and venture capital, so you may be seeking money to fund a big idea. I will tell you more about this placement of Mars, which will extend to October 11, in your September forecast.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>When you encounter the full moon in Aquarius on August 1, it will be a sign that you need more rest. It is also possible that this full moon might bring news from someone who had taken great pains to keep it hidden from you. This may shed light on a contractual matter, certain behavior, or a secret having to do with money. A creative project also seems to be connected, or one involving a romantic attachment.</p>
<p>Overall, you may feel exhausted from life’s demands, so take a break over the full moon period (lasting until August 5), for this should be a time of rest and privacy. If you take a minute to treat yourself to a little quiet time, you will emerge renewed and ready to take on anything life can present to you.</p>
<p>Once the new moon arrives on August 16, you will need to devote your full attention to an interesting project. Something new is likely to come up, and your client or project may be linked to entertainment, the arts, or a luxury brand, or it might have something to do with a product, service, book, or educational program that is directed toward children. These are among the most likely Leo-ruled areas, the place of the new moon, and one of these may land on your desk, but of course, your new assignment could be something different.</p>
<p>This new moon has a problem from Uranus, the planet associated with electricity and electronic chips. Uranus will be in harsh square to the new moon, and this tells me you might have computer or Wi-Fi problems or difficulty with new software in the days and weeks to follow August 16. (It would be best to insert new software early in August or after September 15.)</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>Your sixth house, where the new moon is appearing on August 16, is also the house of the horoscope that has to do with health and well-being. In the weeks that follow this new moon, take the time to have an annual checkup, test your eyes, see your dentist, or have annual screenings you know you should do but rarely find the time for. August will be a slow month, which makes it a perfect time to check in with health professionals.</p>
<p>Although Uranus in Taurus will be in a conflict with the new moon in Leo, Uranus will be supremely friendly to Pluto in Capricorn, and both will beam brilliant beams to Mars in Virgo, forming a golden triangle in the sky. A friend may have an idea to share or even be willing to intervene on your behalf to resolve the conflict, if indeed you are in a disagreement with a present or former partner.</p>
<p>This month we will have a blue moon, a second full moon, this time in Pisces, August 30, influential for an additional five days. Saturn will conjoin the moon, so whatever comes up, you will have to remain realistic and practical. Full moons bring a conclusion to a situation, and while the final answer may not bring the precise outcome that you hoped to see, at least this matter will be settled soon. You will likely see this to be true within five days of the full moon, September 4. Pisces born within five days of February 26 will feel this full moon the most. The matter seems to have something to do with a creative project.</p>
<p>Once you get past August, you may see you can finally turn the page on a long-standing problem.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>Venus will be retrograding in your work-a-day sector, a trend that started last month on July 22, but will turn direct on September 3.</p>
<p>Venus’ brother Mercury will also be retrograde but in your partnership sector from August 23 to September 15. Mercury and Venus are two important planets you need to be in direct orbit to finally put this matter to bed. With six out of eight planets retrograde by the end of August and Jupiter to retrograde September 4, the pace of life will be slow, so simply let nature take its course.</p>
<p>Although you may come to a temporary make-shift settlement or agreement at month’s end, do not sign papers just yet. Wait until after September 15 (if you can) when Mercury will have turned direct, and Venus will be moving in a straight forward orbit, too. The second half of September will be a far better time to completely resolve any dilemma. You can look forward to blue skies and a much smoother road ahead.</p>
<p>You will want to travel at the end of August, but you seem busy at the office then, and your attention will be needed there. You may be able to squeeze in a long, happy weekend away earlier over August 4 to 6, but not much more. Even so, that might be enough to rejuvenate you and make you excited about what is to come in the last four months of the year.</p>
