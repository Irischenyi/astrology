        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>Something interesting is bubbling up for you on the international scene, and the full moon on August 1 will bring things to a culmination. This full moon—a supermoon—will light your solar ninth house of foreign people and places. Uranus is taking the lead at this full moon and will be in divine conversation with Pluto, a powerful, big-money planet that is based in your eighth house of other people’s money. This suggests you may receive an assignment or new client that will pay you well.</p>
<p>Your ninth house rules the information you take in, learn, and disburse to others, which is why this house rules publishing and broadcasting projects, including ones in the digital world. Your ninth house also has to do with long-distance travel, so you may be in the first phase of planning for a major trip overseas that you’ll take later this year. Your international relationships should go exceedingly well. It seems your trip will be for business, but it’s clear you can mix in pleasure while you’re there too, if you’d like.</p>
<p>Uranus and Pluto are slow-moving, so they have not been close enough to converse since they made a grand conjunction in June 1966. (They were friendly in 1995-1996 with a milder aspect, a sextile, being 60 degrees apart, signifying opportunity.) Uranus and Pluto will soon make an exact trine (a divinely harmonious aspect) from July 2026 through May 2028, and then not again until 2064.</p>
<p>The reason I mention this extraordinary meeting of Uranus and Pluto now is that in anticipation of their aspect in 2026, they have been silently moving into position in deep space, and they are now within six degrees of a perfect trine. Some astrologers say these two planets need to be within four degrees, but I give a slightly wider berth and feel they are now significantly close enough to exert an uplifting influence. This is especially true because Uranus is in charge of the August 1 full moon. You may feel this full moon’s happy message from August 1 to August 5.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>Uranus brings unexpected developments, but under positive aspects like these, the changes will be welcome ones. Pluto offers transformation, and this trine, which will take place over several years, will give you more license to “let you be you.” You seem to be ready to break free from other people’s expectations, and your intuition will also grow stronger (even if it is already strong now).</p>
<p>This will be especially noticeable in business, so if you work in the media (publishing, broadcasting, or the digital world) or the arts, or you are an artist, you will be able to show your audience what they will soon be eager for before they know they desire it themselves. The job of the artist is always to anticipate what is coming over the horizon before anyone else does. As Steve Jobs said, “People don’t know what they want until you show it to them.”</p>
<p>Let’s now turn to your home and family, which seems to be a huge hub of activity for you. Mars entered Virgo on July 10, and this change seems to have sharpened your attention on your house and the alterations you’d like to make there (or you may have moved house), or you may be eyeing a new property you’ve wanted to buy, sell, or rent. If your focus has been on one family member, you might be concerned about this person, such as a parent or one of your children, who needs financial help or more of your time and attention than usual.</p>
<blockquote><p>The full moon on August 30 will be in your highly prestigious tenth house of career advancement and recognition, so you may get a very heavy-duty promotion at that time.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>Mars is known to stir the pot, so although I have never found Mars to cause family arguments in my life, this might be the case for you. I hope that’s not true, but if it is, you have an opportunity to talk with the relative who has been a thorn in your side and reach a resolution. Mars is about to leave Virgo—the reason you currently have such a strong spotlight on your home and family—but this will change and simmer down after August 27 when Mars leaves Virgo.</p>
<p>At that time, Mars will move to a far more compatible place in the sky—Libra, your house of romance and a fellow air sign like yours. This will bring you more fun.</p>
<p>I love one particular day for you, August 1, not because this is the date of the full moon, but because Mars will reach out in a beautiful, harmonious trine to good-fortune Jupiter. This is one of my favorite aspects—when an action will lead to profit and happiness.</p>
<p>In your case, Jupiter is in a behind-the-scenes position, so a confidential meeting or something you don’t even know about that is happening behind closed doors will affect you. This will relate to welcoming news regarding your home or family. Pluto, from his perch in your financial eighth house of other people’s money, will join this aspect and offer financial help. All these planets will work together for you by early -to mid-August.</p>
<p>Pluto is on the cusp of your ninth house of international relations, import-export, the media, legal matters, and your pursuit of an advanced degree—all of these areas will glow for you.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>You may be thinking about a trip in August, but there will be problems. Either you will have too much work to do at your home base and find you cannot go, or the experience of travel itself will be difficult. You have two points of the month when you may be thinking of going, but both are mired in problems.</p>
<p>The first urge to pack might come up on the August 1 full moon, influential for five days. You would most likely want to leave Friday night, August 4, and return Sunday, August 6. Saturn is in Pisces, your house of career advancement and reputation, and is in direct total opposition to Mercury, the travel planet. Your ruler Saturn will be blocking your path, and you may hesitate before leaving your house since your presence will be sorely missed at the office or at your home base, or you might not feel like spending money freely right now.</p>
<p>Your second urge to go away will come in the many days that follow the new moon on August 16 in Leo. Uranus will be a wild child, tightly taunting the Sun, new moon, and even Venus. Your third house (where the August 16 new moon will fall) rules travel and also written, verbal, and digital communication. This point in the month seems even worse for a trip than the full moon on August 1.</p>
<p>Although this new moon in Leo on August 16 should normally be compatible with your Gemini air element, Uranus will rattle everyone’s nerves no matter what zodiac sign they happen to be. With the Sun, new moon, and Venus all in your third house of quick travel and under siege, trips in the weeks ahead won’t be easy. (All new moons have a very long tail, encompassing weeks ahead.) You could be delayed at the airport, or you might find the reason for taking the trip is negated once you’re there. There are many possibilities, and none of them will be appealing.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>If you are going for pleasure to a location known to attract crowds of tourists, leaving in September or October may sound like a better option. For business, next month would be far better to have a productive meeting, and I will show you why.</p>
<p>The retrograde planets will affect you quite a bit this month. Venus began to retrograde July 22 and will go direct September 3. Venus rules beauty, romance, love, fun, lavish social events, and luxury goods, like precious gems, jewelry, and expensive perfume. All these areas are backsliding now that Venus is out of phase. This is not the time to buy a costly new piece of jewelry or to see your dermatologist for Botox or fillers (you might not like the result). You also might want to hold off on buying that new designer bag, as another example. (You may find one you like more later.)</p>
<p>Single people should not start a new relationship at this time because Venus, the planet of warmth and affection, is weak. When you begin anything new, you are creating the birth of the action, and you don’t want to build a weak Venus into its DNA.</p>
<p>Additionally, Mercury is about to retrograde, which will overlap with part of Venus retrograde. Mercury will go retrograde from August 23 to September 15, and because Mercury rules Gemini, this is a planet you must watch. For all practical purposes, you shouldn’t do anything of earthshaking importance during August.</p>
<p>Look how many planets will be retrograde in August—six in all—Mercury, Venus, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. (The Sun and moon never retrograde. Fortunately, Mars is not presently retrograde and will not go retrograde any time soon, and Jupiter will go retrograde in September. The planets we feel strongest when retrograde are Venus, Mars, and Mercury, for they orbit closest to Earth.) If you ever feel like you are walking through glue this month, you now know why. Don’t sign a key contract or close on a house—you may find you did not have all the facts you needed and will regret it.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>Let’s now turn to Mars because the action planet always deserves attention, and for you, Mars is currently moving through your house of home. You may be thinking a lot about fixing up your place or moving. Or you might be decluttering, packing things up for charity that you no longer need. Alternatively, you could be calling in the painters, buying a new piece of furniture, renovating your kitchen, or making repairs, or you might be working with a landscaper to beautify your property.</p>
<p>There are other ways you can use Mars in Virgo—you may be thinking about your family and devoting more time and attention to one particular member, such as your mother, father, sister, cousin, or your child, as some examples. (Your child can be any age, very little or grown-up.) You could be trying to help your relative, or because Mars’ presence often creates noise in the sector it enters, you might disagree with a relative and have noisy squabbles. (I hope this is not the way things are working out for you. I have never found this interpretation to be a common one for readers. It is possible, though.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, the noise I see may be because you will entertain friends with a party or barbeque, or you might invite your pals or family to stay with you during August, and you’re fluffing up the pillows in your guest room.</p>
<p>In the first week of August, Mars will be in perfect trine to good-fortune Jupiter, a gorgeous aspect, so you may find a bargain for a new piece of furniture then, or if you listed one of your properties with Airbnb, you could find business is brisk with many guests interested in staying at your property.</p>
<p>If you listed your house as a possible movie location, you may receive a fee from a production company in August. This trend will finish when Mars leaves Virgo on August 27, and your attention will be directed to having more fun and leisure (another reason I feel you would do best to take your vacation in September or early October).</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>The month’s third lunation, technically August’s second full moon—a blue moon—will occur on August 30 in Pisces, 7 degrees. This is also a rocky lunation, so you see, the universe is not being gentle with any of us this month.</p>
<p>This full moon on August 30 will be tightly conjunct Saturn in your highly prestigious tenth house of career advancement and recognition. Saturn is the plant of responsibility, so you may get a very heavy-duty promotion. Saturn naturally rules your eighth house of other people’s money, so the topic may be a commission, royalty, fee, venture capital infusion, bank loan, inheritance, or another fund somehow connected to your work. Saturn makes us live up to our promises, so if for any reason, you did not or could not, a discussion about this (connected to your career) would come up now.</p>
<p>If funds that were due to you were held up or if the bank made a mistake, this full moon would likely put the matter to rest, and everything will be straightened out. Keep looking at your bank’s app to be sure there is no untoward activity. I had a dream one night last October that I had identity theft and was at my bank signing papers, closing my account, and opening another. The next morning (in real life) I looked at my app and was stunned to see that a large, unauthorized check I never wrote was pending—I told the bank that day and stopped it. I caught the identity theft due to a timely dream. Keep checking your app, dear Gemini.</p>
<p>Neptune will run the show at the time of this full moon on August 30, and Pluto, Neptune’s faithful friend, will beam supportive, sustained vibrations to Neptune in your tenth house of professional fame and honors. It does look like you will see some major money at this time, which will certainly be excellent news. You may also receive flattering coverage in the press.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>Not to be outdone by Neptune, Uranus will also dial up Pluto and set up a close, harmonious link (a trine), a rare aspect that will boost your financial prospects.</p>
<p>Even though Mercury, your ruler, will be retrograde, Jupiter will send a shimmering vibration to Mercury at the end of August, so your home or family will be protected by this full moon, too. As you see, aspects are mixed, but a lot will depend on what has been happening in your career leading up to this moment on August 30.</p>
<p>Although the pace of August will be slow (and at times maddeningly so), try to go with the flow. People whose approvals you need will be hard to reach, or if they are in the office, they will be indecisive. The only talks that will work well are those that you initiate with people from your past, from work or your personal life. Enjoy seeing them—these conversations will be highly productive.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You have been taking on responsibilities in your career, working with great concentration. Now that Mars is in Virgo until August 27, you will also have to attend to the pressing needs of your family members or tasks regarding your home or another property-related matter. Your plate is quite full, so understandably, you might feel it’s time for a break. You can take a trip at the full moon in Aquarius on August 1 (influential through August 5), but there are reasons you may decide not to go. Aspects suggest things won’t proceed smoothly, so as much as you’d like to flee town, it might be best to stay home for now.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>If you have decisions to make and actions to take, do so in early August. Your ruler Mercury will go retrograde from August 23 to September 15, which is usually a quieter time at the office, thankfully.</p>
<p>Venus will still be retrograde until September 3 too, so start to browse the latest fashions for fall and make your detailed list of items you need to refresh your wardrobe, but don’t shop for expensive things until after September 15. (Never come too close to the onset or end date of a planet’s retrograde period as there will be confusing static in the air.) If you wait until late September to shop, you will have a wider range of clothing and accessories to choose from and be more excited about your purchases.</p>
<p>If you are in sales or are self-employed, the collaboration between Uranus and Pluto, a rare event, could help you manifest a powerfully lucrative agreement with an influential client, and it will happen just when you assumed the deal would never come to fruition.</p>
<p>To be clear, Uranus and Pluto will not create an exact aspect this month, but these two powerful planets will be moving closer into position in deep space, and I feel they are close enough to help you now. Uranus and Pluto will make their first exact trine on July 18, 2026, and Uranus will continue speaking with Pluto in a friendly, sparkly way until May 10, 2028. By the time this period arrives, Uranus will be in Gemini and Pluto will be in Aquarius—great for you! For now, Uranus in Taurus and Pluto in Capricorn can help you financially, which I feel is also wonderful.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>One of the most heartwarming moments due to take place this month is at the same time as the full moon on August 1 thanks to a friendly collaboration between Jupiter in Taurus and Mars in Virgo. A confidential talk you may initiate regarding a home or family matter will lead to a marvelous result. Both Mercury and Venus will both be moving direct (a normal orbit) after September 15. (Venus turns direct a little earlier, September 3.)</p>
<p>Again, you will be thinking about travel, but the new moon on August 16 may bring up an unexpected obstacle. Although you may be aching to get away, it would be best to stay back, clear up routine matters, and focus on ongoing projects first. If you do, you will have a more enjoyable period off next month.</p>
<p>You may be asked to sign papers, but again, it is not the time to do so. Delay meetings and signings for now, for little will be accomplished. You can, however, have preliminary financial meetings with your banker, broker, venture capitalist, insurance agent, or estate manager to look at your range of options. With a golden triangle of planets linking Pluto in your financial house, reaching out to Mars and Mercury in your home and family sector and Uranus in your confidential talks sector, you may hear about options you had not considered previously—this would happen after the new moon appears on August 16, plus 10 days. Plan to proceed with your course of action in September.</p>
<p>As August draws to a close, a full moon on August 30 in Pisces will mark a major moment in your career timeline. News will come within four days of this date, and it seems you will be offered an impressive opportunity to take on additional responsibility and gain more influence along with it. Like everything else this month, there will be crosscurrents with an occasional glitch to iron out.</p>
<p>A lot depends on how you’ve performed in your career leading up to this point. Saturn will give you a cosmic report card, and you will know how you are doing. Even though this is not a perfect full moon, there are solidly positive elements to it, so this moment could prove life-changing. Take your opportunities seriously, and ask many questions. If you receive an offer, see if you can start after September 15.</p>
