        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>Many zodiac signs will have problems with August, but your sign, Capricorn, will do far better than the others. Five out of eight planets will be retrograde: Venus, Mercury (soon in August), Saturn, Neptune, and Pluto (Uranus goes retrograde August 28, followed by Jupiter on September 4). The planets you feel most noticeably when retrograde are the ones that orbit closest to Earth—Venus, Mercury, and Mars, but Mars is the only planet not in retrograde. Thank goodness for that—Mars is the planet of action and will not retrograde anytime soon.</p>
<p>You will likely be comfortable with the month, for five out of ten heavenly bodies will be in earth signs like yours (Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, and Pluto), plus two additional planets that will be in compatible water signs (Neptune and your ruler, Saturn) so that means you have seven out of eight planets in your favor.</p>
<p>Venus started to go out of phase on July 22 and will continue in that mode until she goes direct on September 3. If you find that progress in your career is lumbering along too slowly for your taste, don’t be concerned—Venus rules your tenth house of all professional progress, and your career advancement will start to clip along at a steady, quick pace once you get to mid-September.</p>
<p>The cusp of your solar fifth house of true love is also Venus-ruled, so when it comes to love and fun, again, be patient. I had written a lot about what you should and should not do when Venus is retrograde, and you can access last month’s forecast on Astrologyzone.com by looking for the blue box found at the bottom of each page of your current forecast where it reads “View Previous Month.”</p>

        <p>If you have my app, Astrology Zone Horoscopes (Apple App Store or Google Play), go to the current monthly forecast, and you can access last month’s by tapping on July at the top of the screen. I never leave up more than one prior month.</p>
<p>Venus rules love, beauty, luxury, parties, and fun. Briefly, when Venus is retrograde, love is usually lackluster. This will mainly affect single Capricorns, not seriously attached or married ones. Singles, I suggest you do not schedule a first date this month because your first date will set the tone for your future relationship. It may seem so exciting when you first meet, but with Venus retrograde, love could cool off too soon and leave you perplexed. When any planet retrogrades, we cannot access their greatest gifts. Ideally wait until September 15 or beyond for that first date.</p>
<p>Venus retrograde is not a time to schedule procedures like Botox or fillers from your dermatologist or to ask your hair stylist to create a radically new hair style or color for you—you may not like the results. Venus rules parties, but this is not the time to throw an expensive, lavish party or elegant charity fundraiser (donations may be lower than expected). If you are hoping to buy a pricey piece of jewelry, wait until next month.</p>

        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>Let’s now start at the top of the month and look at how you can use it to your best ability. As you enter the month on August 1, you will be greeted by the full moon in Aquarius, 9 degrees, lighting your second house of earned income. If you had asked for a raise, you might get the answer at this full moon.</p>
<p>Your outlook is mixed. On one hand, Saturn left your income sector in March this year, a placement Saturn had held for nearly three years. Saturn is known to limit and had put a cap on your income. You are free of Saturn now, and he is not due to return to this part of your chart until 2050. That alone should improve your outlook for better earning in the future.</p>
<p>This full moon on August 1 is flawed, however, for Uranus will tightly and harshly square Venus. Venus rules your career and love sectors, so neither area will go especially well. In terms of a raise, for example, if you did not apply for a raise earlier, don’t do it now. Wait for better days—I suggest your best point will be next June.</p>
<p>In the first five days of August, with Venus square Uranus, you may need to cover a large, unanticipated expense, most likely related to care for your child. Alternatively, you may decline participation in an expensive social event because you simply are not in the mood to spend a lot of money. If this happens, that’s okay, because you will have lots more opportunities.</p>
<p>In 2023 and the first five months of 2024, you will host good-fortune Jupiter in your house of true love and fun, making you (and Taurus) the sign most likely to fall in love and have a rich, happy social experience. Over the course of many months, 2023 and early 2024 could stand out as the best in a decade for enjoying romance and nurturing your emotional life. It’s just that August is not your romantic month as Venus is napping. On the upside, many Capricorns will choose to have a baby, either this year or in the first five months of 2024—a great time to do so.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>Speaking of fun, you have exciting travel written all over your chart in August. You might assume everyone has travel in their future in August, but that is not true. (As an example, I wrote in Sagittarius’ forecast they should not be traveling at all!) You will have help from Mars in Virgo until August 27 to pack and go, and you may see the truth of this immediately. Here’s why:</p>
<p>You have a golden aspect that may spontaneously give you the desire to hit the road. At the very start of the month, you have action Mars in highly compatible Virgo moving through your ninth house of travel and reaching out to Jupiter in Taurus, your fifth house of true love—I adore this aspect! If you can take time off, go during August’s first week, or at least travel during August’s first weekend. You may very well have a fun, breathlessly romantic holiday. You won’t have to spend a lot of money—look for a bargain package, for you are likely to find one that you feel is perfect. What will matter is that you spend time with the person or people who mean the most to you.</p>
<p>You will get an even bigger chance to travel next month after the gorgeous new moon of September 14, and in the weeks to follow. That new moon will energize your distant travel sector (ninth house) and is one of the best new moons of all of 2023.</p>
<p>An emphasis on money will come up frequently this month. It certainly will at the full moon in Aquarius, 9 degrees, on August 1 and again at the new moon August 16 in Leo, 23 degrees. Just as he did at the full moon, Uranus will rear his head again at the new moon but this time in a more difficult way. Uranus in Taurus will aim his cannons at the Sun, new moon, and Venus—all three at once, as they are traveling shoulder to shoulder in close degrees in Leo.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>At the new moon on August 16, we find the universe speaking in riddles. On one hand, Uranus will make you think twice about spending money. You may hear from the government about taxes, or you may need to find money to cover a student loan payment or an installment for a bank loan. You may need money to pay off a credit card. Be mindful of your belongings as you do your daily rounds because it would be too easy this month to forget your glasses in a taxi, your iPad on an airplane, or your smart phone at the bank. Label all your valuables with a business card taped to the back. I am sorry to have to transmit this possibility, for Mercury about to turn retrograde makes us feel rushed and forgetful. A new moon usually allows you to set up a new program, so you may be refining your finances and putting them on a sturdier path.</p>
<p>The nature of Uranus is unpredictable, so it’s hard to say what will come up, but it will be something you are not expecting. All zodiac signs are in the same boat, as everyone will feel this wild child new moon on August 16, which will have a strong area of influence lasting ten days or longer after it appears. I feel you will do better than other signs because you will be surrounded by many comforting earth-sign planets. They will act like little relatives who love you and want the best for you.</p>
<p>I said the universe is speaking in riddles this month, and especially at this new moon August 16. Although it sounds a bit dry, you’ll be paying bills and taxes. At the very same time, you will have a stunningly beautiful aspect. Mars in Virgo, your travel and international trade and relationship sector (ninth house), will zing a lovely beam straight to Uranus in Taurus, your romance house, which also includes matters related to children. Uranus and Mars in separate houses will each reach out to transformative Pluto in Capricorn, your first house of personality. Together they all form a perfect golden triangle. Any trip you take mid-month will be incredible fun, and as long as you can keep track of costs and spending, you will have a wonderful experience.</p>
<p>Now let’s talk about Mercury, which is about to retrograde in Virgo, a sign it rules, from August 23 to September 15. Since Mercury will be in Virgo, its effect will be stronger than usual. Fortunately, the end of August is generally a quiet time of the year for many people, so you may not be too frustrated by Mercury’s tendency to create delays and make technology go haywire. If you have to use new software, do it early in August, far away from August 23. This is why you should not resume normal activities, especially in business, until after both Venus and Mercury are done retrograding, September 15.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>Do your best not to sign a contract or to even give your verbal assent (which means the same thing as a signature in astrology) until that date as well. Sometimes, however, we have to sign the lease or lose the chance to get the apartment, or accept the job or lose the opportunity.</p>
<p>We cannot always organize life the way we want it to be. You might have the chance to renegotiate the paperwork when it comes up for renewal. If you don’t expect to stay in a situation a long time, it’s okay to sign. If you are going back to a past situation or relationship, then you can agree to terms worry-free—you started your relationship a long time ago.</p>
<p>Try to schedule a trip for fun and love in the first two weeks of August. You are moving into a very heavy career-oriented period—the most important of the year.</p>
<p>First, Mars will enter Libra, your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievements, on August 27 until October 11. This is the first time in two years that Mars is in this area of your chart, and you will find it much easier to get your foot in the door with VIPs who can represent your skills and experience, leading to a new position with more influence and power.</p>
<p>The new moon on October 14 will take up the banner when Mars leaves Libra and gives you an even better chance to move up to a better job. If you use your creativity and imagination in your line of work, Jupiter will make you a virtual idea factory in coming months.</p>
<p>While you can rest, do so now, dear Capricorn. You won’t lose any career momentum. In fact, you are about to reach new plateaus in September, October, and beyond. This is all such good news!</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>The month closes on a second full moon in Pisces, conjunct Saturn, giving it a serious tone. You may be dealing with a business matter, but with Neptune opposed to Mercury, details are unclear. You should find way to take a few days off if possible and simply unplug.</p>
<p>Capricorn is always sensitive to the needs of family, and this would be a perfect time to check in with your mother to see how she’s doing. She won’t reach out to you necessarily, but she certainly will be glad to hear from you—or get a surprise visit. If you are married, it appears your partner could use some quiet time off, too.</p>
<p>If you can’t visit your mother for any reason, choose a cozy cabin in the woods near a lake, or rent a cottage by the ocean. Do nothing more strenuous than sip iced tea as you read a good book. You will come back refreshed and ready to take on the world if you do.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>As you enter the month, the full moon on August 1 finds you likely working on finishing up your financial tasks. You may be paying all bills, but also hearing about a raise you petitioned for or getting word back on a proposal you offered a client. International or overseas business and import-export are favored, as are imaginative, creative projects.</p>
<p>Matters related to love and fun, creativity, and self-expression will also get a big boost as the month begins, thanks to a brilliant cooperation between active Mars and good-fortune Jupiter on August 1.</p>
<p>You may need to streamline long-standing financial agreements with others or your bank by negotiating a better deal, and you may feel an urgency to do so after the new moon on August 16. Financial details seem unclear, and you will be motivated to get the full story. Your chart has many positive, supportive aspects that can help you get your answer.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>If you are wrestling with an unexpected tax bill, insurance claim, or sudden twist in the division of property in a divorce or other legal case, rely on an expert’s advice. Uranus, the planet of unexpected news, will be taunting just about everyone mid-month. Your ability to adjust and think outside the box will be tested regarding finances just after this new moon arrives August 16.</p>
<p>You need a break, and it looks like you can safely take a vacation once your financial decisions and actions are made in the first half of the month.</p>
<p>Are you afraid to take a short vacation because you will miss a special career opportunity by being out of town? That’s not likely. Saturn, your ruler, has been retrograding since mid-June and will remain out of phase until November 4. Venus, the planet ruling your prestigious career advancement, is also retrograde and will not normalize until September 3. Mercury, the planet of communication, contracts, negotiation, and commerce will soon retrograde from August 23 to September 15, so nothing of earth-shattering importance is likely to happen while you take your holiday.</p>
<p>The full moon of August 30 has a somber tone (allow five additional days of influence, taking you to September 4). It will be a full moon in Pisces conjunct Saturn, so don’t over-schedule your agenda with too many activities. Again, spending a lot of money will not be what you want to do. This full moon will almost force you to slow down and get the reset you need. If you do want a change of scene, you might drive to the ocean shore or to a setting near a lake.</p>
<p>Saturn will be near the full moon, so you may want to visit your mother instead of going to a resort (the moon in a chart rules mother and also the domestic condition). Saturn will oppose the Sun, indicating you will be cost-conscious and unwilling to spend a great deal of money, so an invitation to stay with a family member might sound like a good idea. Your mother may need a little company and will be so glad to see you.</p>
