        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>You have made it through the possibly frustrating full moon on November 27 in Gemini, 5 degrees. Gemini is the sign found opposite your Sagittarius Sun on the horoscope wheel, so if you had a difference of opinion or perspective brewing with a romantic or business partner, it would have come to the surface at that time. Mars was directly opposite the moon, suggesting this person’s words were harsh and may have hurt your feelings.</p>
<p>Still, no matter what you faced, you had Pluto in a supportive angle to that full moon and the Sun, which was a plus. Pluto kept you strong and made you believe in yourself. And although Mars opposed the moon, warrior Mars was in Sagittarius, giving you determination, courage, high energy, and impressive staying power. These qualities can help you persuade others to agree (at least in part) with your way of thinking. It may help to know that Mars comes to your sign only every two years, suggesting you are likely starting a new creative project, professional role, or important romantic or business relationship. You started to have Mars favoring Sagittarius on November 24, where he will remain until January 4.</p>
<p>Sagittarians born within five days of November 27 (or readers who have Sagittarius rising at 0 to 10 degrees) felt the emotions of that full moon very directly. If a partner did not challenge you, it could simply have been that you encountered roadblocks to your goal. Saturn was square to the Sun and full moon, which only means that Saturn forced you to tinker with the problem to find options toward ultimately settling on an answer. This is assuming you wanted to move forward on a job or relationship and not leave the situation or partnership altogether.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>There was also a possibility that you felt the November 27 full moon influence regarding a romantic relationship. That full moon may have asked you if you were truly dedicated to this person for the long road ahead. If you were having second thoughts about committing to a partner and wanted to look at your options, you will do that now. The value of a full moon is that it brings matters to the surface, forcing you to look at them and make decisions. If you are deeply in love—and some readers will wholeheartedly say they are—you may have gotten engaged at this full moon.</p>
<p>With any full moon, so much depends on how things have been going up to that point. The universe aims for two goals: to cleanse situations by forcing transparency and discussion, and to forge progress through a necessary decision. Full moons arrive every four weeks and are very effective at bringing us all to these conclusions.</p>
<p>Mars in Sagittarius is giving you a special glow, and others will be drawn to you. You have come through the November 27 full moon, but that was then, and this is now. In many ways, the first week of December may go exceptionally well for you.</p>

        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>If you’re in need of a vital day when your professional endeavors must proceed immaculately, you have one on December 7 when Mercury will be perfectly positioned to receive Jupiter’s goodness. Said another way, Mercury and Jupiter will be trine each other, making December 7 one of the best days of the month for you. Use this day to have a job interview, pitch a client, or give a speech. Any career goal scheduled on this day will shine brightly.</p>
<p>The new moon in Sagittarius will arrive on December 12, and Mars will tightly accompany this new moon. Mars will continue to give you a high level of enthusiasm and energy. However, Neptune will be problematic at this time, and in the weeks ahead, because Neptune will be in hard angle to the Sun and new moon.</p>
<p>The Sun rules Leo, your ninth house of foreign countries, overseas relationships, international trade, legal matters, publishing, broadcasting, and matters related to higher education (college and beyond). In your solar chart, the moon rules Cancer, your financial eighth house of other people’s money (commissions, bonuses, severance, bank loans, inheritance, venture capital, mortgages, and so forth). Both the Sun and new moon are under duress by Neptune because Neptune is clouding your judgment in one of these areas. Think of Neptune’s fog this way: When you are driving along a road that is filled with fog, for safety’s sake, you need to slow down or pull over to the side of the road until the haze lifts.</p>
<p>Remarkably, on December 6 Neptune will go direct after having been retrograde since June 30. This is excellent news, for Neptune will spend most of December regaining strength and will be ready to help you in January.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>Mercury rules Virgo, your solar tenth house of career, so once Mercury goes retrograde, you will only need to wait until January to make solid professional progress. I say this if (and only if) you can’t advance during the first 10 days of December. The initial days of December will be helpful, but you won’t have a lot of time to mobilize and use them unless you already started doing so last month.</p>
<p>The problem is that Mercury will go retrograde December 13 to January 1. December 13 falls the day after the new moon on December 12, so Mercury retrograde will add another layer of confusion to your life. You will have to slow down, but this is temporary and should be easy to do. People you need to go to for approval will be leaving for the holidays and be hard to reach. Don’t rail against Mercury out of phase—relax with it, for you will benefit from holding back.</p>
<p>It might help to know that January will be a superb month. Planets will be in Capricorn, so January will give you lots of encouraging opportunities to increase your income. As you see, this new moon is mixed, but that only means there will be matters to straighten out and a need for patience.</p>
<p>Now here’s something that may surprise you. After telling you January will be a great month to bump up your income, I will say now that you might receive an influx of cash at the full moon on December 26 in Cancer.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>This full moon will allow you to polish off bills and do some savvy tax planning before the year is out. On the other hand, you may get a bonus from your company or a valuable gift from a family member. The most wonderful part about this full moon is the fact that Jupiter will be trine the Sun and sextile the moon—this is sensational.</p>
<p>Additionally, Saturn will also be beautifully supportive of this full moon, adding stability to your plans. All full moons can deliver their news as early as two days prior to their appearance (December 24) and as late as five days after they appear (up to December 31).</p>
<p>On the following day, December 27, the Sun and Jupiter will reach a peak aspect—a trine—making it a fantastic day for you, especially for distant travel. This extremely superb aspect between Jupiter and the Sun will cover Christmas Day (December 25) and the full moon (December 26), providing an umbrella over all the days this full moon covers (December 24 to December 31). This rare aspect will be worth four stars, and because it includes Jupiter, your ruler, it seems to have your name on it. You love to travel, so consider taking a vacation after the holiday to decompress and relax.</p>
<p>The cherry on top of the cake will be the move of Jupiter direct on December 30, after having been retrograde since September 4. This will help you see progress in all phases of your life. This planet is not only the planet of good fortune—Jupiter also rules Sagittarius. All signs point to a very happy period of weeks and months to come.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>Just as you are getting close to New Year’s Eve, Venus will slip into Sagittarius on December 29, to stay until January 23. This will add a sparkle and glow to your persona at the perfect time, so if you’re invited to a party to ring in 2024, by all means, accept!</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You will enter December full of vim and vigor because Mars is in Sagittarius, a holdover from last month (November 24, to continue until January 4). Having Mars in your sign is a great advantage because others will want to approve your ideas and proposals.</p>
<p>You will receive another boost of energy from the universe when the new moon arrives on December 12 in Sagittarius. This new moon is your cosmic gift from the loving universe. You get a new moon in your sign once a year, always around your birthday. You can direct its energy any way you please, unlike other new moons during the year, which ask you to focus on a specific subject. In your case, you may be thinking of taking a long trip during or right after the holidays, and this, too, would be possible.</p>
<p>Something I had not mentioned earlier is an important aspect: All month, your ruler Jupiter, currently in Taurus, will be in rare sync with Saturn in Pisces. This is a friendly aspect that will allow you to make changes in your work or living arrangements to make life easier. This also suggests that if you’re self-employed, business will soon be brisk (most likely in January), and if you’re hoping to save up to buy a house, you will be pleased with your progress.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>You are doing extremely well in your career, and one day to watch for when you could receive praise from higher-ups is December 7 thanks to a friendly connection between Jupiter and Mercury. Additionally, later in the month on December 18, a former colleague you used to work with or you interviewed with may come back into your life with another opportunity to collaborate.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Mercury will retrograde December 13 to January 1, starting out in Capricorn, your financial house. Checks that people owe you may arrive late, so you may need to send out a gentle second reminder about any outstanding balances ahead of time. Pay close attention to your bank account and credit card statements for unauthorized charges or errors. Additionally, try not to send checks by mail, if possible, because Mercury rules the mail. If you don’t know the recipient’s wiring information, then you can use a courier like UPS, DHL, or FedEx.</p>
<p>Later in the month very happy financial news will arrive with the full moon on December 26, influential from December 24 to December 31. You might be wiping the slate clean by paying as many bills as you can before year’s end so that you can start the New Year off fresh. It’s also possible that on this full moon someone who loves you will give you cash or a very valuable gift, and it will be one that you will treasure forever.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>On December 27 your ruler Jupiter will be trine the Sun, which is one of the most fortunate aspects possible, and the Sun is in Capricorn, your financial house. You may hear news that your company is about to award you a year-end bonus.</p>
<p>Romantically, your life is a little complex. If you are dating seriously, you may have made a decision about whether or not you want to spend the rest of your life with this person. If you are in love, you may have become engaged, and if you are waffling, you may need a bit of distance to make up your mind.</p>
<p>Your social and romantic life could start to heat up on December 29 when Venus enters Sagittarius for nearly four weeks. Venus’ presence in your sign will almost ensure a magical New Year’s Eve with the one you love, and Mars in the late degrees of Sagittarius will only add to your charm and magnetism. Early in December, pick out a new outfit to wear to help ring in the New Year. It looks like at least one festive invitation will be coming your way.</p>
