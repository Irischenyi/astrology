        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>You start December in high spirits and in the perfect state of mind to enjoy the holidays.</p>
<p>You recently came off a full moon at the end of last month in the perfect sign for you—Gemini (5 degrees)—that lit your fifth house of romance. You may have experienced a breathtaking romantic episode at that time or, conversely, made a decision about a person you were dating. Alternatively, you may have been focused on a child or a pregnancy, or, feeling you needed a little fun, you may have found time to take a refreshing quick trip.</p>
<p>Some members of your sign may report they had a good romantic experience at the full moon last month (within days of November 27), and I hope that applied to you. If your natal planets were friendly to that full moon in Gemini, you may have had an especially sweet, romantic, or heartwarming experience. Other Aquarians reported that a person close seemed to be highly emotional and difficult to reason with. Fortunately, matters like this that arise at the full moon usually blow over fairly quickly.</p>
<p>Saturn was in hard angle to last month’s full moon November 27 (a square), so there was likely an obstacle to whatever topic come up, which would have required some discussion in order to untangle the problem. The matter may have involved a romantic relationship, a child or pregnancy, or a creative project that suddenly started to go in the wrong direction. The moon is associated with your sixth house, so additionally, a health matter (such as a cold) or a work task may have come up and needed to be finished and shipped.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>Last month, you may have also been concerned about how much you were spending lately, as Saturn is in your financial second house. Neptune was in hard angle to Mercury, compounding confusion about where the money is going, and why there are so many financial demands on you lately. Your concern about money and the recent expenses will spill over into December.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I can say that almost all of December will turn out to be unusually warm and festive for you—much more so than for people of other signs. Indeed, you are likely to be on the A-list of many of the most important parties and gatherings of the season. If you would like to throw a party, this would be the right month to do so. This same part of the chart rules charitable and humanitarian activities, so you may be moved raise funds to help a group who suffers and who needs greater public awareness of their plight. If you get involved, you will make a difference to the cause you care so deeply about.</p>
<p>All the various areas ruled by this eleventh house of friendship and groups (discussed above) will be a main focus due to the placement of Mars in Sagittarius, but it will also get a boost from the appearance of the new moon December 12, also in Sagittarius. The only persistent problem you might see come up is over your level of spending this month. Neptune, which can cloud information, is again in a bad position (in hard 90-degree angle to the Sun and new moon). This suggests no matter how you try to control your spending this month, another expense seems to pop up that you must cover.</p>
<blockquote><p>The new moon on December 12 will only increase your interaction with friends, a very happy development, for as they say, friends are the family we choose.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>Do the best you can, dear Aquarius. If you download your credit card app, it will show you daily balances, and you can also put alerts on your phone for each time an item is added to your card balance. You might say that everyone is having the same problem with money at holiday time, and to some degree you are right. Still, according to your chart, you seem to be having a slightly harder time controlling your outgo than others.</p>
<p>You are getting confronted with unexpected expenses this month—they seem to stem in large part from your participation in activities with friends. For example, if a friend wants you in her destination wedding, and you wouldn’t think of declining, that event could be expensive. You get the idea.</p>
<p>One superb aspect that will help you financially has to do with the closeness of Jupiter in Taurus and Saturn in Pisces. They had made an exact, rare sextile (60 degrees apart) on June 19 this year, and they are still within three tiny degrees of a perfect sextile. (These two planets move slowly.) That is certainly within the circle of influence.</p>
<p>With Saturn in your financial sector and Jupiter in your home sector, you will have a rare chance to stabilize your savings and grow your wealth through buying real estate. You could purchase a condo or house or even a vacation home. Or you may be renovating your present home to appreciate its value. Consult a real estate broker and also a financial advisor to make sure you make the right moves. Your chart does show opportunity—and it’s rare. This aspect between Jupiter and Saturn, a sextile, will not happen again until 2037.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>If you feel Jupiter has not been helping you enough lately regarding luck with home and family matters, it might be because Jupiter has been retrograde since September 4, but he will go direct on December 30—you should like the change of Jupiter to stronger shape.</p>
<p>One day when you can add to your bank account will come prior to the new moon, on December 7—this is a fabulous day to turn yourself into a money magnet. You can pitch a client, send a query letter to an editor, have a major job interview, give a speech, or do something else that would increase your income. December 7 will be a fortunate day, a day when your efforts have a good chance of finding a way to attract money. If you need to shop for holiday gifts this month, or to sign a contact, do so in the first week of December. Here is why:</p>
<p>Mercury will start to retrograde on December 13 and remain retrograde until January 1. He’ll start out in Capricorn, but quickly move into Sagittarius. You will feel the impending slowdown—postponements, cancellations, and delays—earlier in the month, at least a week before the official onset date of the retrograde, December 13. Do your best to keep lines of communication open to avoid backtracking and re-dos.</p>
<p>The one good part of Mercury retrograde in your eleventh house of friendship is that you will likely come in contact with a friend you have not seen for years. You will certainly enjoy catching up now.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>All month you will be quite popular at work—you have Venus shining at the tip-top of your chart from December 4 to December 29. VIPs will be impressed with your work, and subordinates will want to work for you and learn from you. You may be involved with a visual or creative project that you will enjoy.</p>
<p>The full moon December 26 will fall in Cancer, 5 degrees, and will give you plenty to do. All full moons can be felt two days prior to their appearance and as much as five days after they occur. The romantic spell of the month might be temporarily suspended so that you can concentrate on all the tasks that have to be done.</p>
<p>This is a wonderful full moon because Jupiter, the good fortune planet, will be in a rare and wonderful trine to the Sun. This suggests a partner—steady date or spouse, or a business partner or collaborator—will be a gem and quite helpful and supportive of you. You may see an influx of cash, and that is always welcome news at this time of the year. At the same time, Saturn will also be in direct, supportive contact to the Sun and full moon, adding to your feeling of security and calm.</p>
<p>You need to be sure you don’t overextend yourself during December because this full moon could find you with low immunity to colds and flu.</p>
<p>Of the two holidays, Christmas Day and New Year’s Eve, you will enjoy Christmas more (even if you don’t celebrate Christmas). The transiting moon will be in Gemini on Christmas, so you are likely to enjoy this day very much, and things will come together in a way you will enjoy.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>By New Year’s Eve, you won’t feel like spending more money but would rather be home where you can whip up a gorgeous dinner for those you love, or order catering so you can sit back, enjoy the food you ordered, and watch the countdown on TV to bring in the New Year.</p>
<p>Once Jupiter moves into Gemini at the end of May 2024, you will enter into your best year in over a decade to enjoy genuine, enduring romance. It’s a personal year—one meant to nurture you—and it will bring you your best opportunity in over a decade to find your North Star, your truelove.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You will enter December in a lively, festive mood. Late last month, on November 27, you had a romantic full moon that put you in the mood to enjoy this year’s holiday season. If you say no, then that full moon asked you to decide about the person you were dating—do you see a future? If you don’t, you may have left to open yourself up to new possibilities.</p>
<p>Mars began heating up your social sector last month too (starting November 24), and will continue to stay in your eleventh house of hopes, wishes, and friendships all through this month (and until January 4) to ensure that you get plenty of invitations to see friends.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>The new moon on December 12 will only increase your interaction with friends, a very happy development, for as they say, friends are the family we choose. You will want to be surrounded by those who love you and are loyal to you. The new moon and the days that follow could bring an invitation to attend a party from a friend or from a club you belong to, and it sure looks to be special. All month you seem to be concerned about how much money you will spend if you say yes to all the invitations that you will receive, yet there are always ways to make things work while you keep costs reasonable.</p>
<p>There will be two days this month that will be highly fortunate for you to increase your income. The first, December 7, will be the better of the two for your current situation. It would be the perfect day to pitch a new client or to have an important interview for a new position. It also will be outstanding for a trip for any purpose.</p>
<p>Another special day, perhaps the best of the month to act for the long-term, will be when the Sun and Jupiter make an exact aspect, bringing on a heavenly trine, which will happen on December 27. It’s a rare aspect and one worth four gold stars. Use this day for an action that is hard to achieve—this day will give you an edge.</p>
<p>If you are attempting to sell real estate, you may get an offer on this day, December 27, and all indications are the offer is likely to be more than your asking price—this is the very best offer you will receive this month. Recently, on October 28, you had an eclipse in your house of home, so you may have seen changes there, but with Jupiter fiercely protecting you in that area, you should like any changes you go through, and they’ll work to your benefit.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>Mercury will be retrograde from December 13 to January 1, a time you should not close on a house, sign a contract, or buy any electronics. (Don’t do any of these activities too close to December 13 either—give yourself a big space of days.) You might want to send people you love gift cards, which are always appreciated. Before giving the card, though, photocopy the card’s front and back, including the bar code, and handwrite the recipient’s name on the copy in case the card gets lost. You cannot be too careful when Mercury is retrograde!</p>
<p>Let’s backtrack a little and look at your professional life. When it comes to your career this month, things at work are going well. You have Venus at the highest point in your chart, so VIPs are heaping praise on you while subordinates are competing with each other to work with you. This month it looks like you can do no wrong.</p>
<p>The only day I will tell you to lie low at work will be December 20 when Venus will receive an opposition from your ruler Uranus. Uranus is the planet of unpredictability, so don’t shake the tree, or coconuts will likely fall down and hit you on the head!</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>The full moon on December 26 may find you wrapping up a big assignment. You may work in a seasonal business, which would require you to be at your desk through the holiday, but even so, you will be able to relax by the time you are ready to ring in the New Year. You’ll want a quiet celebration, for you will have been able to socialize whenever you pleased throughout the month, so by December’s end, you’ll be content to kick back, stay home and be with the person(s) you love most.</p>
<p>Family and friends will mix beautifully on December 27, one of the happiest days of the month, deserving of four stars. Jupiter will trine the Sun that day, an aspect that happens quite rarely.</p>
<p>For New Year’s Eve, plan on a small event at home, your luckiest place to be this month and for the next five months.</p>
