        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>You appear to be entering December in high spirits, and with good reason. You have many planets cheering for you in December. Late last month, you had a full moon on November 27 in Gemini at 5 degrees, shining in the highest point in your chart, your tenth house, ruling career honors, awards, and achievements. That full moon was poised to give your professional reputation a big boost, for sure.</p>
<p>It’s possible you were offered a new job or promotion or that you received some wonderful publicity for work well done. Pluto was in strong agreement with that full moon, so if you are self-employed or work in sales and you took on a new assignment, it represented a powerful position. It is also likely that the job or project tapped into your creativity and stylish, sophisticated taste, because Pluto is still in your fifth house, ruling imagination and artistic self-expression.</p>
<p>One of your friends may have played a part in the opportunity that came up, because that full moon at the end of November was linked to your eleventh house of friendships and social groups. If not a friend, alternatively a professional club may have been helpful to you. For example, your club may have had a program that allowed you to meet just the right expert to work with to help you get ahead.</p>
<p>With a higher profile in your industry—and more power, money, and influence—comes more responsibility. Sure enough, Saturn was in a hard square to the Sun and full moon in November, suggesting any new assignment would take all your powers of concentration. As a Virgo you have never shunned work—you embrace it. Being productive is always important to you. If you did take on something new, you already know that to be true.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>If you’re not having a good experience in your career, you may be working in the wrong job or for the wrong company, and you need to look at your options elsewhere. Gemini rules your tenth house of professional reputation, and Jupiter is heading to this very area of your chart. He will arrive May 25, 2024, marking the onset of the very best career opportunities in your life (this is true if you have Virgo rising, too).</p>
<p>In January, start looking for the right position for you—good jobs take many weeks and months to capture. January will be a great month to start because the Sun and new moon will be in Capricorn—an earth sign like yours—which will be very compatible and supportive of your efforts. Aim to get your new position after the spectacular new moon on June 6, 2024. Saturn will again be testing your stamina, concentration, and devotion at that new moon, but if you apply yourself, you could be in a highly influential place by then.</p>
<p>I would like you to circle December 7 on your calendar as spectacular. On this day, good-fortune Jupiter will send a golden beam to Mercury, your ruler, in Capricorn. This could turn out to be a warm and wonderful day, one of your favorites of the month.</p>
<blockquote><p>The end of the month will be your happiest time, for a full moon in Cancer, 5 degrees, on December 26 will shine in your joyous eleventh house of hopes and wishes.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>Soon you will be switching your attention to home. Mars entered your home sector on November 24, and is there to stay until January 4. Mars usually increases the noise level at home when there, so you may be doing last-minute repairs to your home, inviting guests to stay over, or giving a festive holiday party.</p>
<p>The new moon in Sagittarius, 21 degrees, on December 12 will bring more emphasis to your home and family life in the days and weeks to come. Jupiter will take the lead at this new moon, and happily, he will be in contact with Mercury in Sagittarius in a very friendly and affirming way. Mercury is in your house of true love, so this new moon may create a lovely romantic vibration.</p>
<p>However, there is a glitch to this new moon, and it comes from Neptune. Neptune rules all bodies of water, and he also rules fog, snow, and all matters that relate to water (tainted drinking water, problems with plumbing or mold, snow on the roof, and so forth). Neptune will not be friendly, so I worry that you might have a small flood during the second half of the month.</p>
<p>Sometimes we can be careful and avoid water damage, but sometimes we can’t anticipate what is coming. For example, if a pipe is deteriorating inside your walls, you probably won’t know—until a flood strikes. The same is true if you have an appliance with parts that are wearing out, such as a washing machine. I am sorry to have to raise this possibly, and I hope I am wrong.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>There is another way Neptune could assert its difficult angle to the Sun and new moon. Neptune is based in your house of marriage or serious partnership—ruling your partner, steady, serious sweetheart, or a close collaborator or business connection. Neptune can cloud or obscure facts, and such is the case when someone doesn’t want you to know something they are hiding. Or Neptune can cause a misunderstanding when no untoward intent was meant. Aim for clear communication, and if you feel someone is not telling you the whole truth and nothing but the truth, gently probe.</p>
<p>Adding to the possibility for scrambled communicating will be the turn of Mercury retrograde on December 13 until January 1. I wrote about this oncoming retrograde last month, and I dearly hope you have started your holiday shopping. Express couriers like FedEx and UPS will be beset with weather delays, so ship early to avoid frustrations. You shouldn’t really buy electronics during the retrograde, and I suggest you play it safe and give the recipient a gift card so that your giftee can choose their favorite items themselves. Remember to photocopy the card—front and back, and include the number of the card and bar code should it be lost—and of course, handwrite the recipient’s name on each photocopy so you don’t mix up the cards. It is too easy to lose a gift card in the mail or once it arrives, so this will keep them safe. Don’t send a gift card by regular post office mail, as at Christmastime, mail theft is at an all-time high. Don’t believe me? Google “mail theft.” With Mercury retrograde, you cannot be too careful.</p>
<p>The end of the month will be your happiest time, for a full moon in Cancer, 5 degrees, on December 26 will shine in your joyous eleventh house of hopes and wishes. In this house, you may get news that a wish you have long held in your heart is about to come true, and it could involve just about any part of your life.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>The sign of the full moon will be Cancer, and that sign blends beautifully with your Virgo Sun. Cancer rules family, and you will likely feel cozy and cocooned in the warmth of family love. You will absolutely feel this joyous full moon on Christmas Day, December 25, for all full moons create a circle of influence that extends from two days before the full moon arrives and until five days after (December 24 to December 31).</p>
<p>This full moon of December 26 will be especially lovely because Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, will send a direct vibration to the Sun in Capricorn, based in you fifth house of true love—your steady partner or sweetheart who you are dating seriously is apt to be quite attentive to you. This same house rules children too, and they will be part of the fun you have on this day.</p>
<p>Mars will still be in your home sector, and even though the Sun will have moved on to Capricorn, there’s still lots of energy focused on home and family. It appears that you will volunteer to host festivities for your family and friends.</p>
<p>December 27 brings the rays from Jupiter in Taurus to the Sun in Taurus in an even tighter, exact aspect, a glorious vibration linking your house of romance and distant travel. If you feel you need a little vacation after the holidays (as many people do), you may be flying away on this day to ring in the New Year abroad. The full moon will be close enough to add thrilling excitement.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>Speaking of New Year’s Eve, a day many readers love to celebrate, this year the transiting moon will be in Virgo, so you are likely to get things just the way you want them. On this enchanting evening, three heavenly bodies will work together to form a golden triangle in the night sky: At point one will be the transiting moon in Virgo, at point two, Jupiter will be in your distant travel sector (ninth house), and at point three will be the Sun in Capricorn in your fifth house of true love.</p>
<p>How perfect is that? Every Virgo, of every birthday, will have a reason to be cheering about how well things go. Virgos born on August 28, plus or minus five days (or that have Virgo rising at 6 degrees, plus or minus five degrees), will get a double dip of pleasure.</p>
<p>The first three weeks of January will continue your enthusiasm for friends and romance—it’s a terrific month for you. You have so much to look forward to!</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>It appears you had exciting career news within days of the full moon on November 27. In fact, that full moon was in Gemini, the sign of the Twins, so you may have received two offers or brought in two new clients, as some examples. This was a very important full moon for you—if you have been taking your job seriously, it was a moment of great reward.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>If you didn’t have a celebratory full moon late last month around November 27, it might mean you are in the wrong job or work for the wrong boss or company. Management may not appreciate all you have to give, so start looking for a new position in January with the aim of getting one after the new moon on June 6, 2024. That new moon will be sweet as sugar for your career and is likely to bring a big breakthrough. Start in January, because top jobs take a long time to get, as most companies do a lot of interviewing before choosing a candidate. Once Jupiter moves to Gemini and your tenth house of prestigious professional success in late May, he will stay there for 12 months, and you will enter your best career year in over a decade.</p>
<p>Home is where your heart is in December. You will start early in the month, dressing up your home with plans to welcome family and friends in for the holidays. Mars is in your fourth sector of home and usually brings noise and activity, so you may be throwing a party or hosting family in your guest room.</p>
<p>The new moon on December 12 will bring even greater focus to your home and family. You seem delighted to be involved with weaving a beautiful, traditional holiday that everyone will long remember. If children are in your family, you will go the extra mile to make it magical. Neptune will be cranky, so guard against problems with water (floods, tainted drinking water, mold, and so forth).</p>
<p>Your ruling planet Mercury will go retrograde December 13 until January 1. This means you must shop early in the month for holiday gifts to avoid empty shelves in the stores. Weather delays are likely too, so packages are likely to take longer to reach your recipient—plan accordingly.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>Lots of people plan to buy electronics to give loved ones for the holidays, but unless you purchased your gift last month (or will in the first week of December), you will be better off giving a gift card so that your loved one can choose their favorite model.</p>
<p>While Mercury officially goes retrograde on December 13, in truth you will feel the slowdown as much as two weeks in advance. The one upbeat part of Mercury retrograde is that it will be a perfect month to reconnect with an old friend or beloved relative you have not seen in a long time.</p>
<p>If you need to sign a contract or make an important speech or client presentation this month, do it on December 7 when Jupiter will send shimmering rays to your ruler Mercury.</p>
<p>The month’s end will be positively glorious. The full moon in Cancer on December 26 in your house of hopes and wishes will coincide with the holidays. A full moon is always felt two days before it arrives (December 24) and as much as five days after (December 31). This practically guarantees a stunning holiday period for you this year.</p>
<p>Also, circle December 27 when the Sun, by now in Capricorn, your house of true love, will magnificently signal Jupiter, the planet of happiness. This would be a spectacular time to take a post-holiday trip, and in fact, you may find an airline ticket in one of Santa’s stockings hanging by the fireplace.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>On December 28 Venus will be in sweet sextile to Pluto. If you want to be assured that your partner really loves you, this day might spark a philosophical talk with the one you love, and afterwards you’ll realize you had nothing to worry about—your sweetheart or partner’s love for you is as deep as the deep blue sea.</p>
<p>It seems that you’re getting ready to ring in the New Year surrounded by friends or traveling to a fabulous distant and romantic vacation. It’s a good idea—this way you can gently decompress from the hustle-bustle of all you had to do for the holidays.</p>
<p>New Year’s Eve seems tailor-made for you, with the transiting moon in Virgo supported by good-fortune Jupiter in your ninth house of international travel and the Sun in Capricorn in your most romantic sector (fifth house). This is as good as it gets! You will be showered with golden confetti, so it’s worth planning something for this lovely evening, even if only to have a beautiful dinner in a special restaurant for the occasion.</p>
<p>You won’t feel any letdown after New Year’s Eve is over—January continues the bright and shiny aspects, so much so that you may later say January 2024 turned out to be one of your favorite months of the year. You do have an exciting forecast.</p>
