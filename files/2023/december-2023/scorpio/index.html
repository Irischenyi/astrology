        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>You seem to be quite focused on your finances this month. This trend started last month during the November 27 full moon in Gemini at 5 degrees—it appears you may have paid many bills at that time, but it is also likely that you saw an influx of money. The area of your solar chart that this full moon lit up was the eighth house of other people’s money, ruling credit cards, loans, commissions, bonuses, inheritances, venture capital, court settlements (including but not limited to divorce agreements and the division of property at the termination of a business), and profits gained from any kind of sale, such as from real estate.</p>
<p>That full moon was not the only factor in your chart drawing your attention to your personal income and outgoing cash. Mars, one of your rulers, entered Sagittarius and your solar second house of earned income on November 24 (and will remain there until January 4).</p>
<p>You seem to be spending a lot now, and you might say everyone spends a great deal in December—on gifts! Yes, that’s true, but your horoscope specifically seems to show a greater-than-even-at-holiday-time drain from your bank account this month. Mars usually increases spending, and it appears you may have at least one very large check to write. Saturn, positioned in your fifth house, suggests that if you have a child, your money is being directed to take good care of him or her (perhaps through schools, a tutor, after-school activities, a nanny, new clothes, shoes, toys, and so forth).</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>If you have no children, the fifth house rules fun and love, as well as creativity, so that gives us clues as to where the money may be going—you may be spending it on gifts, a special vacation, social activities, or a creative project. You may want to keep track of your weekly spending, which you can do if you have your credit card app on your smart phone—this could help you manage funds and not have sticker shock later.</p>
<p>If you need to sign a contract, the very best day will be December 7 when Mercury and Jupiter will be beautifully oriented in a heavenly trine position. As you will see, you should sign early in the month—on December 7—rather than later, because after the new moon December 12, the days and weeks to follow could be a bad time to sign. If you can get the contract early enough, sign on December 7, and you may be able to make an exceptionally fine agreement with the other party. It would be a win-win for both sides.</p>
<p>The new moon on December 12 will appear in your income house—Sagittarius at 21 degrees. This new moon will be conjunct Mars, so you will become quite motivated to harness greater control over your finances. You will want to pay down debt, cut out waste, and look for the best prices when purchasing gifts and items you need. You may also want to find new sources of income. You have your ruling partner Jupiter in your seventh house of experts and collaborators indicating your investments can be much improved if you work with a financial advisor. Ask for names of advisors from friends and family—for if you choose the right expert, you can multiply your savings impressively through investment.</p>
<blockquote><p>By the time you get to the full moon in Cancer, 5 degrees, on December 26, you will be tired of pounding your calculator to study financial matters and ready to take a trip to relax for a few days.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>This new moon on December 12 will be in hard angle to Neptune, a planet that can confuse, fog, or obfuscate information, so having an advisor to help you make investment decisions or a lawyer to help you sort through other financial matters will be a big help. As they say, two heads are better than one. Stay practical and realistic. Again, if you have to sign papers, see if you can do so on December 7, for that would be a far better time to do so than later in December. The day prior, December 6, will also be a good day. If you can’t sign until after the new moon on December 12, put off doing so until January.</p>
<p>There is another, even better reason to receive any important papers you need to sign early in December.</p>
<p>Mercury will retrograde from December 13 to January 1, bringing on delays and problems, and since it begins retrograding in your second financial house, it will affect financial decisions as well. Examine bank and credit card statements to be sure no unauthorized charges are present. Identity theft tends to happen more in December than in other months. When it comes to holiday gift giving, shop for the most important gifts (toys and all electronics) early in the month. There will be severe weather delays in holiday shipping in the second half of the month—take care of your most important family members sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>The new moon will get you thinking about what you’d like to do to boost your financial picture, so plan to take action in January. You can make your blueprint for future action now, however, with the idea of tweaking your finances and making improvements in January. With so much emphasis on your finances, start sketching your financial future now so you can act on those ideas next month.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>By the time you get to the full moon in Cancer, 5 degrees, on December 26, you will be tired of pounding your calculator to study financial matters and ready to take a trip to relax for a few days. Usually, a full moon is only operative for two days prior to its appearance (December 24) and about five days after it occurs (December 31). Although you will be covering a far distance, it appears you may be returning home by New Year’s Eve, perhaps to get ready to return to work.</p>
<p>This full moon is quite a beauty, for Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, will send a shimmering beam (a trine) to the Sun—this suggests you’ll have quite a brief but incredibly happy trip that will include a touch of luxury. A trine aspect is the finest you could ever hope to see. There’s a strong chance your significant other will accompany you on this trip and will be a gem throughout. If you have to take a business trip with a collaborator or business partner, that could go equally well. Saturn will also help by giving weight and importance to your actions and bringing the strong possibility for long-term gain.</p>
<p>In terms of romance and your capacity for fun, Venus will be in Scorpio—the perfect place for you—from December 4 to December 29, coming just in time to bring you extra oomph and charisma during the holiday party season. At the same time, Neptune, planet of unconditional love, turned direct in the divine sign for you, Pisces, on December 6 after being retrograde since June 30. Neptune is in your truelove sector and now will be stronger than it has been in months—this will help love along, too.</p>
<p>Days that stand out regarding Venus include December 5, when Venus in Scorpio will trine Saturn in Pisces—promises made this day will be promises kept.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>On December 9, enjoy the spirit of the season. Jupiter will partner with Venus, so enjoy holiday lights, have dinner in a restaurant decked out in holiday decorations, or take a child to see Santa Clause, as some examples.</p>
<p>December 20 won’t be a good evening out—Venus will oppose Uranus, causing tremors in a relationship. You won’t see the problem coming, causing you to lean on your resourcefulness and ingenuity to figure out what to do.</p>
<p>A wonderful day will occur on December 25, a highly romantic, spiritual day, when love will flow beautifully and easily. It’s also a day when you might think about those less fortunate and send a donation to a charity.</p>
<p>I will insert here December 27, one of the most special, sparkly days of the month when Jupiter will make an exact trine to the Sun. Happiness will be showered over you, and even your career may bring good news and compliments.</p>
<p>Venus will form a sextile with your ruler Pluto on December 28, a day when you will want to be assured that your sweetheart or spouse truly loves you—the answer should delight you, making you feel more secure and loved unconditionally.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>If you have been hoping your sweetheart will propose, it could happen soon—Jupiter, now based in your marriage sector, will go direct on December 30, and soon after you may have your answer. All your close partnerships will move along more smoothly after this day.</p>
<p>On New Year’s Eve, December 31, the transiting moon will be in Virgo and your eleventh house of friendship. You might decide to have a small gathering at your house. As a rule, Scorpios do not like crowded parties—your sign is known to be eager to spend meaningful time one-on-one with a small group rather than move through the party to say hello to many. This can be a very cozy, happy experience.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You have been thinking a lot about your finances as the year draws to a close. Near the recent full moon last month on November 27, you may have done some savvy tax planning or opened an investment account. If not, the first early days of December will give you a second chance to do so.</p>
<p>Other financial matters will be on your mind during the new moon on December 12, and it looks like you will be spending a lot of money this month—more than usual. You might say that every sign spends a lot in December, and that’s true, but your horoscope shows that you are among the few signs spending more than usual. Luckily, the new moon will fall in your house of earned income, giving you the opportunity to ask for a raise or look for more business if self-employed. If you love your job and make good money, you can still come out ahead by cutting out waste, looking for good prices, and investing wisely.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>You may get an opportunity to start a new job to make more money, but because this new moon conflicts with Neptune, you should ask many questions about what will be expected of you. Something about the offer seems unclear. That doesn’t mean you will need to turn it down, it just means that you may misunderstand an important element, so have your lawyer look at the contract, and huddle with your financial adviser to make the decision.</p>
<p>Mercury will be retrograde from December 13 to January 1, but you will begin to feel the slowdown at least a week earlier. When shopping for holiday gifts, secure your most important gifts in the first week of December, and be sure to ship early, as the mail will be slow due to adverse weather conditions or strikes brought on by Mercury retrograde.</p>
<p>On another note, you will be happy to hear that Venus is in Scorpio from December 4 to December 29, making you the most popular person at any festive gathering. On December 5, if you promise your heart to the one you love, your love will last forever.</p>
<p>On December 25, Venus will receive silvery beams from Neptune, warming your heart and making you feel surrounded by those who love you unconditionally.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>It looks like you will be successful in improving your cash flow, because on December 27, the Sun in your third house of agreements will receive a beam from Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, and Jupiter will be positioned in your partnership house. This means that someone who represents you in business, such as an agent or publicist, may introduce you to a client who is interested in your services. If you’re not in business, your luck could come through your romantic partner, and single Scorpios may give or receive a marriage proposal on this magical day.</p>
<p>On December 28, Venus and Pluto will be in friendly communication, amping up your charm and bringing opportunity for a memorable, romantic evening. This may be extra special because Pluto is your ruling planet!</p>
<p>For New Year’s Eve, the transiting moon will be in Virgo. Arrange a wonderful potluck dinner where everybody brings their favorite dish. You prefer small, personal gatherings where you can have meaningful conversations, so entertaining at home or accepting an invitation from a friend to go to their home sounds just like your cup of tea.</p>
