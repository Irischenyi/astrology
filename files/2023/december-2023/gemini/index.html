        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>As I wrote last month, you had a full moon on November 27 in Gemini at 5 degrees, so a matter of ultimate importance to you was being settled. If you wondered what this full moon would bring to fullness that was of super-high priority to you (and you felt you had many areas of interest but weren’t sure what would urgently come to a culmination within five days of November 27), you soon found out.</p>
<p>Yet there were problems with this full moon. Neptune was in conflict with your ruler Mercury, which was in Sagittarius, so you had to be wary of miscommunications, especially involving money and the details of a job assignment. You may have hired a specialist to create something for you or were discussing a project you would complete for a client. Saturn was in hard angle to both the Sun and full moon, so you might have felt overwhelmed. You may have correctly sensed your professional reputation and image in the industry would be affected by the subject discussed. The pressure you felt to hit the right note during these discussions required grace, finesse, character, and business savvy.</p>
<p>Now in December you are in collaboration mode—it’s clear you need to work with one or more experts, specialists, an agent, or other partner. Mars has been traveling in Sagittarius, your partnership sector, since November 24, to remain until January 4. During this time, you may be open to an idea that one or two specialists are advising you to pursue. You will try to respect this person’s expertise and talent, but you could feel you have to rein in one or both collaborators (different people working on distinct projects), yet you might feel pressure to cave in and conform. You will gain more control next month when Mars leaves Sagittarius on January 4. In the meantime, you need to stand up for your own ideas, too—I agree that doing this diplomatically could be tricky, but if anyone can talk circles around others, it’s you. Use your talent for communication, dear Gemini.</p>
<p>For any deal you’ve made, you’re likely aware you will have to closely watch how it proceeds. That full moon was in Gemini, so there were probably two projects on the table, and you won’t be able to set either on autopilot. Stay alert, and don’t be shy about voicing your point of view as you progress.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>The urge to join forces with another person will intensify at the new moon in Sagittarius, 21 degrees, on December 12. Both the Sun and new moon will join Mars in Sagittarius, who’s been there since November 24. This new moon will be better aspected than the November 27 full moon, so although this new moon is not perfect, it’s a little more favorable than the previous full moon. Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, will reach out to Mercury in Capricorn, your eighth house of other people’s money. If you are hiring a specialist to get the project going, the funds will appear (thanks to Jupiter)—so search for them, and they will show up.</p>
<p>You need to know you are running straight into Mercury retrograde on December 13, to last until January 1—an aspect that impacts every sign. Mercury affects you more directly because you (and Virgo) are ruled by Mercury. Any new project or relationship you enter now may require patience because Mercury is known to bring fits and starts as well as delays and redos. Mercury will be in your financial eighth house, so be prepared for the possibility of a few extra expenses or overruns. If you need approvals from a VIP, or if you have been having meetings or interviews with one, finding out what’s happening will be nearly impossible. This person will be missing in action. You know what? It would be best not to find out now—wait until January when you will encounter a much sunnier, supportive environment.</p>
<p>If you are not in a business situation like I’ve just described, you may be hoping to get engaged. Many couples propose at Christmas time or on New Year’s Day. Neptune is putting his fingerprints all over these weeks, and Neptune is known to spread haze. You might feel caught up in the idea and fantasy of being swept away by the sea of love, rushing to the excitement of engagement, but you should not hurry. Think through the relationship. I am concerned that Mercury is about to retrograde—can you hold off until January?</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no doubt that this month, instead of thinking “me,” you will be thinking in terms of “we.”</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>The full moon in Cancer, 5 degrees, due December 26 will bring a flurry of financial activity. You appear to be paying bills, but you may also be depositing holiday money into your account that kind relatives have sent you. It looks like someone was—or is about to be—quite generous with you. You may receive a cash gift or a valuable piece of jewelry.</p>
<p>You will feel some sensational aspects around this full moon, and my favorite planet Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, is building power in an ideal angle to the Sun, a heavenly trine. At the same time, Jupiter will be in a beautifully oriented sextile to the full moon. Jupiter is in your behind-the-scenes twelfth house, so you may not be aware that someone who loves you is planning to give you a lavish gift.</p>
<p>Money will go out now too, perhaps because you will be thinking about all the tax deductions you would be able to legally claim if you pay your bills before the end of the year. Check with your accountant, and follow her advice. Other people may be paying you early too, for the same reason.</p>
<p>All month Jupiter and Saturn will be sextile, an opportunity aspect, and by month’s end, they will be in a closer, tighter aspect. (These two titans of the solar system last met in perfect sextile—precisely 60 degrees apart—this year on June 19 and won’t meet like this again until May 4, 2037. The point is, this is a rare aspect, and these two planets will still be in significant closeness, within 3 degrees of a sextile, so they will certainly be able to help you.)</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>The way this will affect you so positively is in your career. Saturn is in Pisces, your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement and is being bolstered by good-fortune Jupiter in a very hidden place in your chart. Saturn is adding responsibility to your shoulders, and while you may assume no one is paying attention to your excellent work, it seems the people who matter—VIPs who can help you professionally—HAVE noticed. Right now you cannot see these people because they are tucked away in your twelfth house, but you will next year after Jupiter moves out into the open in Gemini for the first time in 12 years. Keep working with the faith that you are advancing to where you most want to be.</p>
<p>Christmas Eve and Christmas Day bring the transiting moon to Gemini on both days, so you will likely have a wonderful holiday and feel the glow of being with those you love during this festive time. You will still feel the heightened, positive emotions of the full moon in Cancer on Christmas Day for the full moon will occur the following day.</p>
<p>I want to digress for a moment to tell you about one of your favorite points of the month, which will come on Thursday, December 7, when Mercury in Capricorn receives shimmering rays from Jupiter, the good-fortune planet. You will feel this approaching energy growing the day before, on Wednesday, December 6. Mercury is your ruler, so this aspect has your name on it—it’s a day when everything will go your way.</p>
<p>Jumping ahead now, your other luckier-than-a-leprechaun-day will be December 27 when Jupiter will send a gorgeous set of sparkling beams to the Sun. If you will be on a trip at this time, you will love how it unfolds. This aspect has a wide field of influence, so you will start to feel it from December 24 straight through December 28.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>New Year’s Eve brings the transiting moon to Virgo, shining in your house of home and family. A golden triangle will appear in the sky linking the moon in Virgo, your home and family sector, to the rays from Jupiter in Taurus, your hidden, private sector, while also reaching out to the Sun in Capricorn, your eighth house of transformation. Plan to spend a quiet, private, and loving celebration with the one you adore, and together, whisper your biggest dreams for the year ahead. You have quite a special month ahead, dear Gemini.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>This month your ruler Mercury will be very active. One of your best days will be December 7 when Mercury receives golden beams from Jupiter. This is a perfect day to give a speech, hand in a manuscript, make a pitch, travel for any reason, or simply find you are in the perfect place at exactly the right time. This is a Thursday—you will also feel the powerful energy of December 7 growing larger the prior day, Wednesday, December 6, so you can use either day for extra luck.</p>
<p>Be mindful that Mercury will be retrograde December 13 to January 1. This will snarl holiday travel plans, so allow lots of time to get to the airport. Once there, you may face delays, so keep your computer and cord with you so you can stay occupied. Experts suggest you download your airline’s app should your flight be canceled, so have it installed on your smartphone just in case. (I hope this will not happen!) Leave a few days’ space prior to the holiday to be sure you don’t miss it. Flying on Christmas Eve may be shaving things too close. If you’re traveling by car, confirm you have the right address for your destination—and keep a map in your glove compartment (GPS sometimes goes off the rails).</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>If you shop early, you will have the happiest holiday season in years. At the beginning of the month, retail stores will be stocked full of merchandise, but as you get to the second half, you will discover that inventory is low, and the gift you had your heart set on giving someone special will be out of stock and hard to find elsewhere.</p>
<p>All month Mars will be in your opposite sign of Sagittarius, and a new moon will appear in this same sign on December 12. If you’re in love, you have a very strong chance of getting engaged this month. If you’re already married, you may be making plans for something special you and your spouse can do in the New Year, such as to buy a house, have a baby, or start a business together. You seem eager to make more of your relationship.</p>
<p>Another way you can use this bright new moon on December 12 is to hire a collaborator to work with on an important project in the days that follow. There is no doubt that this month, instead of thinking “me,” you will be thinking in terms of “we.”</p>
<p>If you are teaming up with an expert or collaborator for a business reason, you’ll feel the weight of responsibility for the person you’re hiring. You will need to clearly delineate which roles each of you will play to have a successful relationship. With Neptune casting a veil over reality at this new moon, whether your commitment is for love or business, it will be wise to share your hopes and vision of the future in detail to make sure you’re both on the same page.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>Even with Mercury retrograde, Christmas Day should find you magnetic and excited about all the festivities to come. The transiting moon will be in Gemini on December 24 and 25, which suggests you’ll be in the spotlight, and on the same day, Venus will trine Neptune, a loving and glamourous vibration, making your holiday special.</p>
<p>Most of this month you’ll be cognizant of money matters and may be doing some smart year-end tax planning with your accountant. By December 26 when the full moon in Cancer shimmers, you will be ready to pay off bills and balance your budget as you prepare to close the books on 2023.</p>
<p>Just when you may feel your bank balance is running low for having bought too many gifts, Jupiter will come to the rescue on December 27 with a surprise influx of cash. You will leave the year smiling and eager to experience all the goodness of 2024.</p>
