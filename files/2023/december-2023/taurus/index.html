        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>Over the course of your life, as a Taurus, you like to see that you have a nest egg and that you’ve found a way to make it grow. In this month, which so heavily emphasizes financial management, you will be focused on your salary, or if self-employed, the fees and profits you are generating. The full moon in Gemini that occurred late last month on November 27 started your meditation on money. You seem to be paying bills and perhaps made an expensive purchase on or near that date.</p>
<p>When it comes to shaping a clear financial picture, that full moon of November 27 may have brought more questions than answers, at least for now. Neptune clouded facts by blocking the path of Mercury, the planet that rules your second house of earned income. There is still time to answer hard questions, and if you do, you are likely to find a way to bring in more money.</p>
<p>You will be helped with this meditation of financial matters by the new moon of December 12 in Sagittarius, 21 degrees, which will occur in your other financial house, your eighth house of other people’s money. A new moon will usually open weeks of opportunity, and in your case, it will be to find ways to earn, spend, save, and invest more effectively.</p>
<p>It’s the year end, so you may be huddling with your accountant to do some last-minute tax planning to take advantage of favorable, legal deductions to your year’s tax return. You may also look for waste and start cutting any recurring expenses that you no longer need or enjoy. If you need university financial aid or a student loan to go to graduate school, this is the time to send in your application. If you are starting a business, or want to invest more in a business you started some time ago, you may seek a loan or an infusion of venture capital this month. The new moon of December 12 makes this a good time to pitch or apply, and make sure you do so after (not before) this new moon appears.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>This new moon will be in conflict with Neptune, so you will have to look closely at your cash flow as well as have clearly defined goals.</p>
<p>If you are in the process of dividing property in a divorce or splitting assets at the dissolution of a business, Neptune’s position concerns me—you will have to be sure your soon-to-be-ex-partner is being completely transparent and truthful. The only way you might be able to know is to have a forensic accountant help you follow the money.</p>
<p>Jupiter and Saturn are in sync with each other, but a new day is dawning, with new methods and procedures. If you feel something is not adding up and not making sense, keep looking until you find the answer. Another way this new moon may work out (without being in a divorce or the end of a business) is that you may need to change your overall approach to handling money and how you appropriate funds, save, invest, and spend. If you haven’t been particularly careful to watch where your money has been going, this month you may want to look closely and examine your regular expenses, study your income, and make adjustments from what you find.</p>

        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>If you work in the arts—painting, music, poetry, dance, photography, or entertainment, as some examples, you might not be ruffled by Neptune in hard angle to the Sun and new moon, for Neptune governs all of the creative arts. Still, watch the budget for each project you work on, for with Neptune in hard angle, you could experience overruns.</p>
<p>Another way things may work out is that because this is holiday season, you may go overboard buying gifts for friends and relatives. You are a generous soul—an admirable quality—but if you look, you can find real bargains this month. This way you won’t get sticker shock when your credit card bill arrives in January.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to your relationship with someone close, most likely your spouse or serious steady sweetheart. I should add that, as an alternative, this person could be a business partner or collaborator. Here is what I am looking at:</p>
<p>Taurus is ruled by Venus, and Venus is currently moving through your collaborative seventh house, ruling marriage and also your business partner, financial advisor, lawyer, accountant, stock analyst, agent, or anyone who would work closely with you in a confidential, one-on-one helpful way. The fact that Venus is in this collaborative, partnership house suggests you will be willing to work with someone you trust who can suggest ways to improve your financial picture. Alternatively, you may be negotiating with a client on fees and expenses. If so, make sure you have thought of all possible expenses and contingencies—I say this because of Neptune’s position.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>If you have to sign a contact, do so when Jupiter will be in elegant angle to Mercury, December 7. Mercury rules all legal agreements, so this would be the ideal day to sign. This is a Thursday, but you will feel the approaching energy as it builds a day earlier, on December 6. Do not sign anything this month much later than December 6 or 7. The month is moving toward a Mercury retrograde, and we always feel its undertow in advance of its official turnaround date.</p>
<p>Specifically, Mercury will be retrograde from December 13 to January 1. One positive part of Mercury retrograde is that you are likely to see friends and family you have not seen in a long time, and getting together again is always fun.</p>
<p>Mercury retrograde does mean you will need to shop and ship packages early in the month. If you just can’t get it all done, then consider giving a gift card to a retailer you know your recipient loves to frequent. If you go this route, photocopy the card, front and back, staple the copied pages together, and write your recipient’s name on the photocopy (assuming you will be giving more than one person a gift card—otherwise, if you don’t put the person’s name on your photocopy everything will get all mixed up). I know December can be a stressful month with all you need to do, and people do appreciate gift cards.</p>
<p>After all of December’s emphasis on money management, you will be happy to leave town at the full moon in Cancer on December 26, influential three days before this date, and five days after. This is a beautiful full moon with Jupiter in ideal angle to the Sun in Capricorn and full moon in Cancer, bringing on a spiritual feeling of happiness, generosity, and warmth. A Cancer full moon is a watery moon and earth (like your Taurus Sun) and water make flowers. Family traditions should warm your heart.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>Uranus will oppose your ruler Venus at the full the moon, so if your partner becomes grumpy on or near the full moon, don’t make a big deal of it. You would be best to ignore the crankiness and give that person a little slack. Later, the person will likely return to their more congenial self.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Saturn will be perfectly supportive of the Sun and full moon within days circling December 26, helping you spin memories that could last forever. This full moon has more sweet aspects than untoward ones, so keep your eyes on the bright side. A full moon in Cancer is extra special, for it is the sign of family, so appropriate for the holiday season—if you will be with family, things overall should go exquisitely well.</p>
<p>Many readers all over the world look forward to New Year’s Eve, a sparkly time to go out and ring in the New Year. This year, December 31 will bring one of your best experiences. The moon will be transiting to Virgo, shining in your fifth house of true love. There’s more! The moon will be positioned at the first point of a triangle and will be receiving golden beams from the Sun in Capricorn and from Jupiter in Taurus.</p>
<p>The Sun is moving through your long-distance travel sector (ninth house). If you will be celebrating the New Year on foreign (or distant) shores, that would be exciting. You would have fun whether you travel near or far. Completing the third point of the golden triangle in the sky will be Jupiter in Taurus, positioned in your first house of personality—making you irresistibly incandescent with a glow that comes from knowing you are loved. Many couples choose New Year’s Eve to become engaged, and if that includes you, you have chosen an enchanting date. (I might ask you to make the formal engagement on January 2 after Mercury goes direct, but that choice is up to you. I can say the evening will be quite romantic for you.)</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>As you see, on New Year’s Eve all these celestial bodies will be in earth signs like yours, each one supporting you wholeheartedly. If you are a Taurus born at the start of your sign, the end of April, you will get a double dip of pleasure, but all Taurus will be filled with happiness. What a wonderful outlook you have for a memorable, loving New Year’s Eve!</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>It’s holiday time, and you are in a generous mood. Mars is circulating in your eighth house of other people’s money, ruling credit cards and other such funds. It looks like you may be going overboard when it comes to buying presents for just about everyone you know. Keep in mind that your friends and family will appreciate your gifts just as much even if you don’t spend quite as lavishly.</p>
<p>In a different manifestation, you may be making an application for a loan, mortgage, or university financial aid, or pitching venture capitalists, in which case, if you act early in the month, your timing will be good. Mars in Sagittarius and touring your eighth house will help you.</p>
<p>Luckily, the new moon will appear in this very same area—other people’s money—on December 12. That new moon will also give you the impetus to look for ways to bring in a large sum to accomplish a goal.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>Neptune won’t be friendly, so you may need to examine your finances closely to decipher what’s going on. Taurus likes to see financial growth over time, and this new moon will be helpful in setting you on a good track, assuming you will be willing to make the necessary large or small course corrections on your road to wealth. A partner, such as your accountant, financial advisor, or other professional, will also be willing to advise you about ways to reach your financial goals. This would also be a perfect time to do some savvy year-end tax planning</p>
<p>With the new moon in hard angle to Neptune, examine your bank and credit card statements to make sure you don’t find any unauthorized charges. Holiday time is when most people find discrepancies. Let’s hope you don’t find any.</p>
<p>The good news is that Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, is still in Taurus and will remain in your sign until May 25, 2024. You are looking at one of the best years of your life, for you are now within what I like to call your Emerald Year. Keep in mind that the seeds you plant between now and the end of May of next year will start to come up in your garden by June, and you will begin to enjoy the fruits of your labors.</p>
<p>The full moon in family-oriented Cancer on December 26 will encompass two days before and five days after, so it appears this holiday will be special. You may have planned a holiday-oriented trip, near or far from home. For December 25, you may be visiting your sister or brother, as siblings are figuring prominently in your chart this month.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>Mercury will be retrograde from December 13 until January 1, so make sure your car is tuned up and ready for inclement weather. Delays will be almost inevitable, so accept them as they arrive, and just laugh when the universe slows you down. Mercury retrograde will bring you in contact with at least one old friend whom you haven’t seen in ages, and reconnecting will be fun.</p>
<p>December 27 will be a day shimmering in gold—Jupiter in Taurus will be in divine sync with the Sun in Capricorn. It’s a perfect day to travel to distant shores. If you cannot go away, invite guests into your home to give a pre-2024 party. Mix friends and family of all ages together—it will be a success.</p>
<p>New Year’s Eve could be a standout for you, for the moon, Sun, and Jupiter will join hands to create a golden triangle in the sky, an aspect of breathtaking harmony and love. The transiting moon will be in Virgo, the perfect place for Taurus, and will give you heaps of possibilities for experiencing romance.</p>
<p>Even if you rarely make plans for New Year’s Eve, this would the right year to plan to do something special with the one you love. Whether your plan turns out to be big or small, it looks like you will enjoy the evening, and you will create a memories woven delicately with golden treads.</p>
