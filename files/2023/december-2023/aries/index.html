        <p>December is a busy month for everyone, and even if you decided you aren’t going to travel anywhere, you might now change your mind. The thought of being in a new setting may sound too irresistible. Mars in fellow fire-sign Sagittarius is building energy in your ninth house of distant points and is providing you with energy, motivation, and opportunity to pack and go. Mars, your ruler, entered Sagittarius on November 24 and will stay until January 4, 2024, giving December a lovely luster for you.</p>
<p>Mars began to lay the groundwork for you to travel, and . . .</p>
<p>The new moon of December 12 in Sagittarius may make you even MORE determined to leave town in the weeks to come. If you are going way, take nothing for granted because Neptune will be working at cross purposes to the new moon. Double-check your accommodations, and do your best to leave early in the day. Get weather forecasts, and follow them faithfully—Neptune can bring serious problems with snow, flash flooding, or fog. Neptune can alternatively create confusion with directions or a wrong address: The company or person you are visiting moved—and no one told you.</p>
<p>This new moon, however, will help you if you work in publishing or broadcasting or if you’re in college or graduate school, so give your projects all you have. If you are waiting on an immigration matter or one involving a passport, visa, residency card, or related matters, you will likely see progress after this new moon.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>There’s another wonderful gift that this new moon will give you, and it involves growing your savings and investments.</p>
<p>Here is the scoop on money matters: This new moon in Sagittarius, 21 degrees, due December 12 (influencing weeks and months ahead) will put Jupiter (in Taurus) front and center. Jupiter will be in rare agreement with Saturn (in Pisces) at the time of this new moon. These planets are in a sextile indicating “opportunity”—Saturn provides long-term, sustained growth when working with Jupiter.</p>
<p>Dear Aries, you have Jupiter in your second house of earned income, so you should do well financially through May 2024. This would be true when it comes to your ability to negotiate a solid salary as well as the wise, conservative actions you have taken—and will take—regarding your investments. Saturn is advising caution, care, and a large dose of patience with a practical and realistic approach in all financial matters. Your willingness to work hard, while revealing a spirit of a strong work ethic, will allow you to continue to grow in wealth during this rare and wonderful collaboration between Jupiter and Saturn.</p>
<p>You will need to shop for holiday gifts early, and if you’re shipping those gifts, get them in the mail early. Mercury is about to go retrograde again, December 13 to January 1. This will have both positive, upbeat effects, but frustrating ones, too. The happy part of Mercury retrograde is that you are likely to come in contact with people you have not seen in some time—friends, family, colleagues, neighbors, and acquaintances—whose company you enjoy.</p>
<p>The challenging side of Mercury in retrograde will be the problems it will set up when it comes to transportation and shipping, two areas ruled by Mercury. This month Mercury will retrograde in Sagittarius, a travel sign, which will only exacerbate the situation. You can expect severe weather delays both in travel and shipping and the possibility of worker strikes to slow down progress.</p>
<blockquote><p>Many Aries are looking forward to New Year’s Eve, December 31, to celebrate the coming New Year. . . . Spend it quietly and romantically with the person who means the most to you.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>At work, year-end budgets will be depleted, and people will be missing in action, most likely leaving for an early holiday. If you need approvals, most VIPs will be nearly impossible to reach. Don’t rail against these situations—simply turn inward, think about your own life, and enjoy the holidays. January will be a very strong, positive month for your career where you will be able to get much done. Indeed, it is very likely you will see a major breakthrough in your career in January, so relax—you can afford to give in to festivities without fear you will lose momentum.</p>
<p>The full moon falls on December 26 in Cancer, 5 degrees, and will be an absolutely perfect full moon for fun with family. You will feel this full moon for more than a day of course, for it will exert a strong influence within four days (plus or minus) of this date. This will be a dazzling full moon with good-fortune Jupiter and stable Saturn still in close, friendly communication (as discussed earlier). This will allow both planets to send gifts of generosity and potential for personal financial growth, for Jupiter and Saturn will be beaming their gifts to this full moon in Cancer as well as to the Sun in Capricorn. Also, Venus and Neptune will still be sending enchanting vibes for romantic love from Christmas Day. You may feel enveloped in the cozy love of family, friends, your one-and-only, and children. This full moon will be a wonderful holiday gift.</p>
<p>Some readers will be celebrating Chanukah, also a time for family, which starts December 7 and runs through December 15.</p>
<p>This month the universe has planned something special for everyone, for on December 7, Mercury and Jupiter will be in sensational harmony to each other, forming a trine. This is great for travel, shopping, writing and speaking, and shipping. (Keep in mind Mercury will go retrograde at the tail end of this period on December 13, so the best of this aspect will be clustered near December 7.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>You seem to be doing so well in your career, and you will likely see proof of this on December 27 when the mighty Sun (in Capricorn) and good-fortune Jupiter (in Taurus) will be in a trine position. This means that these two heavenly bodies will be in divine harmony. You may get a gift from your boss, be approved for a bonus, or be given the promise of a raise. This aspect will be influential for four days before December 27 and four days after, making the year-end a wonderful time for good news.</p>
<p>Although this aspect—Jupiter trine the Sun—will link your second house of salary and earned income to your tenth house, ruling your performance in your career, it is such a wonderful 4-star aspect that you might also receive a generous gift from a family member. It might be a beautiful piece of clothing to wear to work, an airline ticket for an unexpected trip for two for some time in the weeks or months ahead, or it might be a valuable piece of jewelry, a spa or salon gift certificate, or something else that you will love and be grateful to receive.</p>
<p>Jupiter has been retrograding since September 4, so if your income has not shown an uptick for a while, it could be because Jupiter was asleep. Jupiter will go direct on December 30, which is very good news, for Jupiter will be revving up his engines to help you in a bigger way financially from then on. If you have a sum of money that is just sitting in your bank account, consider making a conservative investment—as your banker or financial advisor recommends.</p>
<p>Many Aries are looking forward to New Year’s Eve, December 31, to celebrate the coming New Year. The moon will be in Virgo, a reserved, modest sign that favors one-on-one personal experiences rather than one that would involve a group party scene. It will be a lovely night—Jupiter in Taurus will send a perfect beam to the Sun in Capricorn and to the moon in Virgo. The degrees of this golden triangle will be tight and close, meaning this night will be extra special. Spend it quietly and romantically with the person who means the very most to you.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>As you enter December, you are dreaming of being in a distant setting. You’ve worked hard all year, and you may be feeling a need to pull away from your desk and be inspired by being in a new setting. The new moon on December 12 in your ninth house of travel will make these feelings even more intense and allow you to pack and go. Mars, your ruler, is also in your travel house, the international sign of Sagittarius, so your chances of finding yourself in the air or on the road this month are strong.</p>
<p>Mercury is about to retrograde—from December 13 until January 1. This will add some pandemonium to everyone’s travel and holiday plans. If it’s possible to get to your destination in the first half of December and work with your team remotely, that would be ideal. It will be imperative to do your shopping early, too. Things get lost when Mercury is retrograde, so if you plan to simply give gift cards, a good idea would be to photocopy each one, front and back, with the recipient’s name on the page. If you buy multiple gift cards from the same place, they will all look alike—this way you will remember which friend or family member received each one.</p>
<p>By December 18 you will be in full swing with the holiday spirit. Seeing old friends and distant relatives you’ve not seen in ages will make you positively giddy.</p>
<p>On another note, Jupiter and Saturn will be in rare sync, giving you an especially fine opportunity to make long-term financial investments that should pay off handsomely. Always check with your financial adviser first, though. Attending to money matters now would be a smart move.</p>
