        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>You are entering a wonderful month with several areas sparkling for you—home and family, career, romance, and creativity all could show heartwarming progress. Your life will have rare balance and variety and can energize you in a way previous months have not. Will there be little glitches and tangles? Sure—all months have some of those, but the overall, aggregate feeling of December will be pleasing and supportive.</p>
<p>Another piece of good news involves the facts that your two rulers are making news in December. Your modern ruler Neptune, the planet ruling the entire spectrum of creativity, compassion, and unconditional love, will be first to go direct—Neptune has been retrograde since June 30 and will turn direct December 6.</p>
<p>You also have your ancient ruler (assigned to Pisces before Neptune was discovered), the planet of good fortune and happiness—Jupiter. Jupiter has been retrograding since September 4 and will go direct on December 30. These both are slow-moving planets, so it is not unusual for outer planets to be out of phase for four to five months.</p>
<p>If you are making progress, but feel it has not been coming fast enough, or the progress has not been impressive enough considering your efforts, you will love the changes these two planets will bring you in the coming months. What a great way to enter 2024! Neptune will stay in strong, direct orbit until July 2, and Jupiter will stay direct until October 9, both next year.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>Furthermore, you tend to do really well when Jupiter and Neptune are in agreement with each other. That can’t always be the case—the plants are always on the move—but in the coming year, on May 23, 2024, Jupiter in Taurus and Neptune in Pisces will be in divine, exact sync. You won’t need an exact aspect though—your entire first five months of 2024 have Jupiter and Neptune in close supportive commination, making it a stellar period for you.</p>
<p>Until July 2024, both planets will be moving direct, so the coming months are due to be quite favorable for fresh starts.</p>
<p>Saturn is now in Pisces, a place Saturn moved to on March 7, 2023. Pisces born in February are feeling Saturn’s tests of courage and determination most directly now, but these early-born Pisces are also the ones who are currently making the biggest strides in new areas.</p>

        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>Beginning in March 2024, Pisces who were born March 1 to March 9 will start to feel Saturn’s direct rays and likely take on a major, new grown-up responsibly. Pisces born March 10 to 20 will be most affected in 2025. Never dread Saturn—he will show you the depth of your inner strength and prove to you that you can do far more in life than you assume.</p>
<p>Now let’s talk about the full moon in Gemini that you just came through on November 27. As you enter December, you may still be thinking about your family or your physical home. That November full moon in Gemini may have found you decorating your home for the coming holiday and buying gifts for family members. If you were very affected by this full moon, you may have moved recently or saw a renovation finish up. You may have had repairmen come in to fix things to make a polished appearance right before the December holidays.</p>
<p>At the same time, your career is becoming much more active and getting quite a bit of attention from you—and from others who are thinking about you and how well you are doing in your career. Mars, the energy planet, moved into your tenth house of prestigious career advancement on November 24 to stay until January 4. December and the festive holidays may mark “time off” for most people, but not for you—this is your most important period of the year for career advancement.</p>
<p>At the full moon November 27, Saturn was at the midpoint between the Sun and full moon, bringing pressure to your family and home matters and simultaneously to your career. You may have felt pulled in two directions, with demands happening in both places. A full moon can bring tensions to the surface, but then the moon gradually deflates, and as it does, the matters get settled.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>The big headline news is your career this month, and it is sensational. Whatever was happening at home seems to have quieted down, and you can turn your focus completely to advancing your professional standing. Starting November 24, Mars started to lay the groundwork for a bigger career role for you, and now the new moon in Sagittarius, 21 degrees, on December 12 will brighten your career prospects even more. You will need to look for them, but you should be able to find options for getting ahead quickly after this new moon arrives. With most planets on the eastern side of your horoscope, you won’t need a middleman (such as an agent or publicist) to help you locate opportunities—you can do this quite well on your own.</p>
<p>The best part about this new moon is that it looks like a friend will give you a tip or speak up for you to help you toward your breakthrough. I say this because Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, will be reaching out to Mercury in a direct, positive way. Jupiter is based in your communication house, so you may be hoping to write a book, become a regular columnist, start a podcast series, or submit a screenplay, as some examples.</p>
<p>The problem with this new moon is that Neptune will be in hard angle to the Sun and new moon in your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement, so you will have to remain practical and maybe and a tiny bit skeptical. (Being skeptical is not like you—you like to take people at face value. But this time, wait until you have all the facts.) The offer may appear better than it is—quite glamourous—but in reality, not so much. You will need to do all you can to check out the offer and do your due diligence.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>There is another possible problem—Mercury is about to go retrograde in Sagittarius (ruling your lofty career house) from December 13 to January 1 (he starts out in Capricorn but quickly slides into Sagittarius). This will only add to the smoke-and-mirrors atmosphere where nothing will be exactly as it seems. It is not the month to make any important decisions or commitments. You are best to sign contracts in January, which will be quite a good strong month. You can still use December to advertise and self-promote, to continue on your social media campaign, and make live appearances, but make your biggest moves on any topic for the future—career or personal—in January.</p>
<p>Last June 19, Jupiter in Taurus and Saturn in Pisces were in rare, precise sync (creating a “sextile”). This a wonderful aspect that promotes financial growth for the future. Again, your ability to communicate and share information clearly will be an asset. Jupiter and Saturn move very slowly, so they are still within three degrees of a sextile and are continuing to create opportunity for you to start something new. Saturn will see to it that you create a stable base that can yield quite a bit of longevity. Jupiter and Saturn will be even closer to a perfect sextile in January, February, and March 2024. This won’t last forever, so use these sparkling gems in the New Year as soon as possible.</p>
<p>You are about to have a very Merry Christmas. The full moon in Cancer, 5 degrees, will fall on December 26, and you will feel it two days before it reaches fullness (December 24 and 25) and for as much as five days afterwards (up until December 31). Even if you do not celebrate Christmas, you might have the day off. No matter what, this year December 25 will be one the record books. The full moon in the divine-for-Pisces sign of Cancer will bring quite a warm, loving, and possibly highly romantic episode. Fun with children is absolutely likely, too. Drop off your everyday cares like an old winter coat that you let drop to the floor.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>The best part of this full moon on December 26 is that Jupiter will be so close to a perfect trine to the Sun. If you are dating or attached, your partner may surprise you with plans that will touch and delight you. Friends will form a big part of the enjoyment of the week, and if you are due to travel, you will love the experiences you’ll have at your destination. Saturn will support the Sun (sextile) and the full moon (trine) in the most magical way, so the actions you take over this week should have weight and permanence for the future.</p>
<p>On December 27 Jupiter, the great good fortune planet, will signal the Sun with an EXACT trine and be one of your best days of the month. (OK, I am splitting hairs here, but you will see this day December 27 is a standout.) Be sure to be with a friend or two on this enchanting day. Your friends will touch your heart.</p>
<p>For New Year’s Eve, let your partner lead the way. You might want to stay home and spend quality time with each other, or your partner may have a wonderful, memorable idea of something to do that will be too good to miss. The transiting moon will be in your opposite sign of Virgo, so you need not do all the planning. Sometimes it is fun to sit back and see what your significant other can come up with. I promise the year will finish up on a magical week no matter what you plan to do.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to the most important month of the year for your career. Last month, action Mars entered your tenth house of honors, awards, achievement, and fame to start the ball rolling. Mars will remain in your career house, the place it entered November 24, until January 4. This is the first time in two years that Mars has paid a visit to this part of your chart. To ratchet things up to another level, the December 12 new moon will give added boost to your professional life and continue doing so for the weeks and months to come.</p>
<p>Something important seems to be brewing in your career. Saturn is now in Pisces, a sure sign that you’re ready to take on more responsibility in several areas of your life. This new moon has one little glitch—your ruler Neptune will be in hard angle to the new moon, so when you are told of a new opportunity, you may misunderstand what’s entailed. It will be necessary to ask for a written description of the job and all that you will be expected to do, and if you are asked to sign a contract, take your time, show it to a lawyer, and plan to sign in January.</p>
<p>I want you to delay big decisions because Mercury will start to retrograde December 13 and will remain so until January 1, but you will begin to feel the miscommunications brought on by Mercury retrograde at least a week before Mercury turns out of phase. You seem to be in the spotlight, and if you are self-employed, it looks like you will be meeting with at least one reporter to celebrate the good work you did over the course of 2023. Self-employed Pisces will also be able to bring in an impressive new client—and the job would tap your considerable imagination and creativity.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>This month won’t just be about professional interests. One of the sweetest days for love and romance will be when Venus trines your ruler Neptune on December 25, Christmas Day. Someone close is likely to make a gesture that touches your heart. Additionally, an ideal full moon will occur on December 26 in Cancer, brilliantly lighting your house of true and lasting love. Romance will be in the air, and you will also have a chance to have lot of fun with children. Your own creativity may be on display too, as you may have recently finished a big project. It looks like this holiday period will be one you’ll long remember. Saturn in Pisces will support this full moon, suggesting that decisions you make on or near December 26 will last a very long time, possibly forever.</p>
<p>One of the best days of the month comes one day later on December 27 when a quick trip to see a friend may come up, or a message sure to thrill you will come in by text, email, or telephone.</p>
<p>For New Year’s Eve, the transiting moon will be in your opposite sign of Virgo, so let your partner choose what you both will do. Sometimes it’s just really nice to sit back and not have to think of all the possibilities you both could do. This year, let somebody take care of you. Happy Holidays!</p>
