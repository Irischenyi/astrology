        <p>As you enter December, both of your houses of travel are brilliantly lit, and this suggests you may be excited about having recently jetted off to an exotic, distant point sometime near the full moon on November 27. Alternatively, you might be putting the final touches on a trip you will take soon, very likely this month. The full moon in Gemini at 5 degrees on November 27 appeared in your ninth house of long-distance travel, which is the reason I say you have a strong case of wanderlust.</p>
<p>If you did not (or will not) take a trip, there are other areas that will be favorable for you in the first days of December, including news about a legal matter, a conclusion to a publishing or broadcasting project, or an update related to a university or college matter.</p>
<p>That full moon was mostly friendly thanks to a harmonious boost from Pluto. Additionally, another area of gain may have stemmed from your mother or father who is quite supportive of your plans. Libras born in September or who have Libra rising at 5 degrees (plus or minus 5 degrees) were the most likely to feel the direct effects of that full moon.</p>
<p>Now let’s move on to examine the Red Planet’s activities. Action Mars entered Sagittarius, your other travel house, your third house that rules short domestic trips, on November 24, to stay until January 4. It seems you will yearn to travel in weeks ahead.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>This theme that Mars has begun—your yearning to be in a new setting—will intensify with the new moon on December 12, which will light this same third house, Sagittarius, at 21 degrees. This area of your chart not only rules quick, short travel but also agreements, so you may be offered a contract to sign. At the time of this new moon, Jupiter will be in a supremely harmonious angle to Mercury, so if your lawyer gives you the go-ahead to sign, you can, but you must do so instantly. Still, I worry that Neptune, who will be in hard angle to the Sun and new moon, could fog your judgment and thinking.</p>
<p>Worse, not only will Neptune be difficult, but Mercury will retrograde from December 13 to January 1. With Mercury so close to beginning his retrograde at the new moon on December 12, if you don’t consult a lawyer, you are likely to overlook a clause that could cause problems later. Thinking about this, I would rather you sign a contract on your best day, December 7, when Mercury and Jupiter will make a precise, mathematically perfect, and harmonious aspect.</p>
<p>Your third house, which will be so energized by Mars AND the new moon on December 12, also rules your sister and brother. You may be cooking up a surprise get-together for another member of the family. December 7 would be a great day to talk about your plans, but you need not stick only to this day. The entire month should be special, too. The upside to Mercury retrograde is that you will reunite with relatives and friends you’ve not seen in ages, and catching up will be fun.</p>

        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>Financially, you have an excellent chance now to improve how you care for your funds and add structure to your methods. Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck who expands everything he touches (including money), is currently in Taurus, your financial eighth house of other people’s resources. From now until next year when Jupiter leaves Taurus on May 25, 2024, you will be a money magnet—look for new revenue streams, and also explore ways to invest carefully. (You have Uranus in this same house, so avoid any risky investments—slow and sure wins the day. Hire a financial advisor if you don’t already have one.)</p>
<p>Here is the interesting part about what is happening with Saturn’s friendship with Jupiter: On June 19, 2023, Saturn, the planet of stability and long-term growth, sent a rare beam to Jupiter, the good-fortune planet of abundance, and this special event will not occur again until May 4, 2037.</p>
<p>An aspect this big and rare has an area of influence of many weeks. Jupiter and Saturn are still communicating and remain strong. As you get to the latter part of December, Jupiter and Saturn will be within 3 tiny degrees of a perfect sextile, which is an aspect of opportunity. (With a sextile, luck does not land in your lap—instead, you have to DO something to activate the goodness of this aspect. With Saturn part of the equation, your action should be solid and safe.) This means you can balance your accounts and begin to build an excellent investment plan for the future.</p>
<p>If you have not done any estate planning, including writing out your will with a lawyer, plan to do so in January—Jupiter and Saturn will still be within the circle of significance to help you.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>Your career will take center stage at the full moon on December 26 in Cancer, 5 degrees, lighting your tenth house of reputation and professional achievement. Something is coming to a crest now. This full moon is beautifully aspected, so you may be gratified by an accomplishment at your job. It appears a VIP will send you praise, too. If you work in a seasonal business, you could also feel good about the ingenuity you display during the holiday season that causes customers to react so enthusiastically.</p>
<p>A full moon’s influence covers many days—the December 26 full moon will extend from two days before it appears (December 24) to as many as five days after (December 31). The part of this full moon I am so excited about is the support Jupiter will send to the full moon and, simultaneously, to the Sun as well. On top of this, Saturn will be in a beautiful trine to the full moon and also a lovely sextile to the Sun, giving you a comforting sense of job security. You are appreciated at work, and it will be evident at this time. What a great full moon! As said earlier, the moon is reaching fullness in your career sector, and you will have a happy experience regarding your home and family, too.</p>
<p>December 27 is a very strong day for you, and you can use it to reach for success in a matter that may be difficult or require you to stretch a bit. For example, if you hope to buy a house, you can submit an application to your bank to be preapproved for a large mortgage. If you have not found the new home of your dreams yet, be sure to browse listings in the last week of December. Additionally, you may be able to find the perfect, expensive piece of furniture on sale at a great price. You could also have a job interview for a position you dearly want or, if you’re self-employed, pitch an important client.</p>
<p>To be clear, this wonder day, December 27, occurs one day AFTER the full moon in Cancer on December 26. Even so, the heightened energy of this full moon will be evident on December 27, too. Do something hard to achieve where you need an element of luck to gain what you want.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>You will also be especially fortunate in your home -and family-related matters during the last week of December. Your mother, father, or a favorite relative may give you a large check for the holiday, allowing you to make a down payment on a house. Or you might be able to rent a beautiful seaside cottage for the coming summer or take a fabulous ski trip to a snowy wonderland this winter.</p>
<p>As said, you are in a phase when it is possible to increase your cash flow appreciably. Jupiter in Taurus, your eighth house (until May 25, 2024), can bring you approvals for a bank loan or infusion of venture capital, a prize from a charity raffle, or an inheritance or large settlement from the courts before the year is out. Jupiter will become activated in a big way at the full moon on December 26 and also on December 27, but the entire week will shine like diamonds in the Sun.</p>
<p>New Year’s Eve, December 31, will bring the transiting moon to Virgo, so you will likely want to have a quiet, private celebration at home with the person you love. A golden triangle will appear in the night sky with the transiting moon in Virgo basking in glittery beams from the Sun in Capricorn and from Jupiter in Taurus, your money house. You may receive a beautiful, valuable gift from your romantic partner this evening, or you could simply find your sweetheart to be loving and passionate.</p>
<p>This sounds like a fantastic evening for two, perfect for sitting by a crackling fire in the fireplace or standing by the window to watch the glistening snow fall. You won’t have to spend a lot of money, for you have each other. If you don’t have a romantic partner, rather than stay home and feel like you’re vaguely missing out, meet a close friend for an early but elegant dinner at a special-occasion restaurant you’ve always wanted to try.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>Later at home watch the countdown to midnight on TV while you make a list of three goals you want to accomplish in 2024. You have an important, favorable year coming up—one you will enjoy—which will officially start on May 25, 2024, and continue for 12 months, so be optimistic, and think big.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>It’s holiday time, and you have the travel bug. You’ve just come through a full moon in Gemini on November 27, so you may have taken a distant trip, perhaps to be with a sibling or other family member, but you will want and receive more opportunities to leave town.</p>
<p>Specifically, more chances to pack and go are likely to come up at the new moon on December 12, but this time, your trip is likely to be closer to home. It appears that before you go, you will have to clear up a mystery or miscommunication regarding a recent project at work. I am suggesting this due to the foggy position of Neptune. Accordingly, you’ll probably have to tweak it, even though you will be anxious to set off. Once you get through this assignment, fun awaits you on the other side.</p>
<p>Keep in mind Mercury is about to retrograde from December 13 to January 1, and it will retrograde in your home and family sector. You may be one of the few signs that will enjoy Mercury’s backslide because it’s likely to put you in touch with relatives you haven’t seen in a very long time. It’s also possible you will be delving into your family tree and learning things about your predecessors and their talents that you never knew about.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>Do as much of your holiday shopping in the first half of the month as you can because inventory will be low later. If you’re going to send gift cards, take the extra step of sending them with a courier, such as UPS or FedEx, to be sure they arrive on time. Before you put the card into an envelope, photocopy the back and front, including the barcode, and write the recipient’s name on the copy in case your recipient misplaces the card later. When Mercury retrogrades, we all must take extra steps to avoid pandemonium.</p>
<p>You may have fantastic career news during the holiday because on December 26 you will have a full moon in Cancer, your house of professional honors, awards, and achievement. Saturn in Pisces, your projectssector, will be sending both the full moon and the Sun shimmering vibrations, so the news should be excellent. You may be thrilled about a promotion or an offer for a new job, or if you’re self-employed, a partnership with a new client.</p>
<p>The very next day, December 27, you have another sparkler when the Sun and Jupiter will be in divine trine (an aspect of great harmony). This aspect will be so close to the December 26 full moon that it will blend in with it, and you will feel the heightened career energy quite exciting. You could be the recipient of a windfall, such as a generous year-end bonus or large commission. If you are in the market to buy a house, you may be preapproved for a large mortgage. On this day, it might be fun to purchase a charity raffle ticket—you could win a prize.</p>
<p>For New Year’s Eve, plan a quiet celebration. You will be tuckered from all your activity throughout the month. Go for a quiet romantic dinner with the one who is most special to you, and be sure to kiss under the mistletoe.</p>
