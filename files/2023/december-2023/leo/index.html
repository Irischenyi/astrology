        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>You have one of the most joyful forecasts for the coming holiday season. All the little planets are synchronizing with each other to bring you one of the best Decembers in recent memory.</p>
<p>You started to see evidence of this on the November 27 full moon in Gemini, for that full moon lit your magical eleventh house of friendships, hopes, and wishes. The ancient Greek astrologers in the Hellenistic period called this sector of your chart, the eleventh house, where the full moon fell on November 27, the “house of joy.” It was considered one of the most enchanting houses of the horoscope, and modern astrologers agree. Within two days prior to November 27 and up to five days after it appeared, you may have attended a memorable, warm, and happy social event. It would have been one that drew many smiling friends, acquaintances, and new friendly faces together.</p>
<p>If you did not attend a social event, you may have seen evidence that a dream you’ve long held in your heart now has a solid chance of materializing. That full moon at 5 degrees Gemini was likely to have been enjoyed by readers born on July 27, plus or minus four days. Gemini is a double-bodied sign of the Twins, indicating you may have experienced TWO social events to start off the festive season. You are just getting started!</p>
<p>Mars, the action planet, recently entered your romantic fifth house of true love when Mars reached the constellation of Sagittarius on November 24, to stay until January 4. This is perfect. Mars will make you an A-lister all month—everyone will want you at their gathering.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>Venus is the love planet, and Mars is her lover. Venus will move into Sagittarius December 29 and will stay through January 23, and even though Venus and Mars will not make a conjunction, I feel that just being in the same constellation makes Venus and Mars breathlessly happy. The universe keeps sending Venus and Mars on assignments to different parts of the solar system. Typically, all they can hope for is to use their tiny binoculars and gaze at one another across the star-studded night sky. So you see, Venus and Mars are close, and both are in your romantic fifth house for a time.</p>
<p>All these aspects are special, and best of all, there is something even bigger on the way to help boost your love life.</p>
<p>The glorious new moon in your fellow fire-sign Sagittarius on December 12. This will be the one new moon to enjoy with another to the fullest. You only get one new moon a year in your house of true love, so if you are single, you should accept party invitations so you can circulate. This new moon will put good-fortune Jupiter in the lead, and happily, Jupiter will be in a gorgeous angle to Mercury, allowing you to communicate clearly if you make an effort to do so.</p>
<p>Here’s why some effort on your part will be needed: Mercury will go retrograde from December 13 to January 1, and as Mercury will retrograde in your truelove sector, you may come in contact with a former flame or run into an old friend. Since Mercury is connected to your judgment, you may waffle over a decision about whether to continue to date seriously or not. Make your decision in January, dear Leo.</p>
<blockquote><p>This should be an enchanting month that seems tailor-made for you, dear Leo.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>If you are due for an IVF treatment in your quest for a baby (this house rules conception, birth, and care for children), you have several positive aspects, but I wish Mercury were not retrograde. IVF is an expensive process, and you won’t have a lot of control over when the procedure is done. If your doctor says it’s time to try, you have to do it. Let’s think positive thoughts. You do have enough favorable activity in this house to make conception possible!</p>
<p>On another note, Mercury retrograde means you need to shop for gifts in the first week of December. If you had your heart set on giving your child a laptop or your sweetheart a new cell phone and you can’t shop early, purchase a gift card in the store you know your recipient likes best. You should never buy an electronic item while Mercury is out of phase for it is not likely to delight the person you hope to make happy. Don’t buy any electronics for yourself, either.</p>
<p>Continuing my examination of the new moon on December 12 in Sagittarius, I’ve found a glitch, for Neptune will be in hard angle to the Sun and new moon. You might become carried away under the rush and glow of new love. It will be important to keep your feet on the ground and to be as realistic as possible. Don’t make any assumptions. (I know it’s hard!)</p>
<p>If you have a child (especially a teenager), keep an eye on what they are doing and where they are going for Neptune will be in a hard angle to your fifth house which rules your children. As all parents know, it’s important to keep a pulse on your teens.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>You may receive a new creative assignment, but the chances for misunderstandings are strong. Summarize all that you understand has to be done. Check your budget—there may be overruns—and make sure you have added an extra 15 percent for contingencies. When estimating how long it will take, give yourself a little more time. If you get it done earlier, great—everyone will be happy—but don’t put yourself in a stressful situation where you struggle to meet an arbitrary deadline.</p>
<p>Additionally, Neptune is in Pisces, your eighth house of money, so you might spend much more this holiday season than you assume. If you have your credit card company’s app, you can track your balance throughout the month so you don’t get sticker shock when the bill arrives. Credit card apps really do help us stay on top of our spending, and with Neptune so strong this month, I suggest you look at the app often to see where you stand. There is no law that says you have to wait until the end of the month to send a payment—I like to pay balances throughout the month so that I never have a huge amount to settle at once. Everyone approaches financial management differently, but I offer this to you in case you like this method.</p>
<p>If you do decide to buy gift cards for friends and family, be sure to photocopy the front and back of each card and put the recipient’s name on the photocopy to file for safekeeping, should it be misplaced. Trust me, someone will lose it, or it will get lost in the mail. Don’t send gift cards or checks through the regular post office—use a carrier like UPS or FedEx—as mail theft is rampant at Christmastime.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>When you photocopy the card, you need the name of the retailer, card number, and a picture of the barcode. Then you need to handwrite the name of the recipient on the photocopy. Do this for each person you give a card to for the holidays. If you don’t write the person’s name on the photocopy, all your work will be useless, for you will be confused about which person received which card. If the retailer emails the gift card to your recipient, call your friend or relative to check their email to find their surprise. Some people miss emailed gifts. With Mercury retrograde, we all have to go the extra mile to be sure everything goes right.</p>
<p>Keep your health strong all month. The full moon in Cancer on December 26 (covering December 24 to December 31) will fall in your twelfth house, and sometimes that means your immunity to colds and flu will be low. You will be very busy, and you may feel you’ve given all you can by this point. This is hard timing, just as you are approaching the main event, the holidays. Pace yourself this month, and be sure you have excellent nutrition and enough rest.</p>
<p>There is another way this full moon on December 26 could affect you—a big surprise or secret could come out. This is what Christmas is all about, so let’s hope this is how things work out for you! You may have a surprise for someone close, or a beloved person may have one for you.</p>
<p>This full moon on December 26 will have lovely aspects associated with it. Saturn will be in a beautiful trine to the full moon and sextile (opportunity angle) to the Sun. This year you may be making a decision about your finances that will be very beneficial to you and your family for Saturn is in Pisces, your financial eighth house.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>On December 27—and affecting the December 26 full moon—fortunate Jupiter will be in an ideal angle to the Sun, your ruling star. (Everyone will love this aspect, but you will love it more because you are the only sign, dear Leo, ruled by the Sun.) This aspect may bring great news about your career and your fabulous performance. This aspect will extend beyond your work—it’s a perfect day to do anything that matters to you for which you dearly need to see a positive outcome. I love this day for you. It’s a 4-star day.</p>
<p>Something else rather rare is happening this month. Jupiter and Saturn will be in a lovely agreement. Now they won’t be in a perfect sextile—60 degrees apart—that already happened on June 19, 2023. However, Jupiter and Saturn are slow moving, and by this month’s end, they will still be within 3 tiny degrees of a sextile, which is within the area of influence.</p>
<p>The net result is you will have a chance to take the money you are earning—and most likely you’ll be making more with each passing year—and decide how to create wealth. Saturn’s support of Jupiter suggests you can succeed financially through slow, stable investments. (Saturn is all about being cautious and conservative, while Jupiter brings generosity and growth when combined with Saturn.) During the first week of December, or sometime in the first three weeks of January, you may want to huddle with your financial advisor to make a plan for 2024. It would be an excellent time to do so.</p>
<p>Romantically, this will be a very satisfying month, but once the Sun moves into Capricorn (December 21), your work life will begin to gently heat up. By the last days of December, you will have to smoothly switch your attention back to your job. Work will be a big focus in January, especially after Mars enters Capricorn on January 4 to February 12. January will be a remarkably upbeat month, and you will enjoy it (I say that even though you will be back to work). Throughout December, give yourself completely and joyfully to love.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You have entered the most romantic month of the year. Mars will be circulating your house of true love for the entire month, and the new moon will join Mars and the Sun on December 12 in Sagittarius, adding increased energy and opportunity. By all means, if you’re hoping to find that one special person, December will give you your best chance of 2023, and it would likely happen at a social event.</p>
<p>You may be concerned about money for you may have to spend to attend festivities. I say this because the new moon will be in hard angle to Saturn in Pisces, your financial eighth house, but there are ways to do things without breaking the bank. You can rent a dress or suit or find an amazing travel package if you need to go to a destination event. Of course, you can use your frequent flier miles too, as two examples. Put your thinking cap on, because I want you to use these glittering stars to their fullest advantage.</p>
<p>If you’re already attached, this is the time to treat your partner to dinner at a special-occasion restaurant—ask your mother to babysit your kids. If you have small children, the second half of the month would be perfect for taking them to stores to see the lights and pretty displays and to help them make up a list of toys they hope to receive from Santa.</p>
<p>The new moon on December 12 could green-light a new creative project you will be working on in the weeks and months ahead. Leo is one of the signs of high-level creativity, so this would be wonderful news. There is some indication that this project, one you would be passionate about, is something you had to put aside due to bad timing or not having enough time or money, and it could now come alive again. That would be especially good news.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>You’ve had a very successful year so far professionally, and it will only get bigger in 2024. Watch the spring, and especially May, for big news you’ll want to share with friends and family about a career breakthrough. Continue to present your ideas to influential people because one or two VIPs will take you under their wing.The seeds you are planting now will grow into tall oak trees in the second half of 2024.</p>
<p>Some Leos will use the strong sparkling aspects in their fifth house this month to take an international vacation, and it would be a great time to do so. Keep in mind that Mercury will be retrograde from December 13 to January 1 in this same area of your chart. Book your airline tickets in advance of December 13, or they will be subject to change later. Make sure all your suitcases have Apple AirTags inside to track your luggage in case that becomes necessary. Mail will be slow, and express couriers will have weather delays, so for everything you do in December, allow extra time. If you need to be in a city on a certain date, don’t leave the day before—go a few days earlier if possible.</p>
<p>The full moon will occur on December 26 and find you happily home and in need of rest. Although you are usually very social and give extra life to any party, by this time you will be content to unplug and catch up on sleep.</p>
<p>On December 27, the best day of the month for Leo, you may receive a surprise from Santa’s sack—it looks like this could be news from your boss with praise of how well you did all season. A promotion may be possible or an offer from a competitive firm. If you work for yourself, you may bring in a prestigious new client when you least expect one. Be ready.</p>
<p>This should be an enchanting month that seems tailor-made for you, dear Leo.</p>
