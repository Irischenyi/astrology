        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>You have a lot on your plate, and just when you assumed the atmosphere at work could not become any more demanding, more work piles on. You might work in a seasonal holiday business, but even if you do not, it is clear that your contribution to the company is essential and valued—even if you don’t feel especially appreciated right now.</p>
<p>The heat was turned up the minute Mars, the natural ruler of your tenth house of prestigious career accomplishment, entered your sixth house of work assignments on November 24—and he’s here to stay until January 4. Your office has become akin to a chicken coop, with feathers flying, along with the ever-present demand to produce more golden eggs with each passing day. This pressure cooker atmosphere is not conducive to aiding productivity, but the people at the top (or clients, if self-employed) seem too involved with their own stressors to realize this.</p>
<p>You will have to find ways to give yourself tiny breaks, and the holidays, with all the preparations that come with them, are, of course, adding another layer of stress. If you can hire a college or high school student for several hours a week to run personal errands and do simple tasks (like wrapping presents), you may feel more relaxed. At the full moon last month on November 27, you may have felt run down, and may have even caught a cold (I hope not!). Your chart shows a strong need for good nutrition, enough sleep, and intermittent rest points, otherwise you will continue to increase your vulnerability to colds and flus. Keep taking good care of yourself.</p>
<p>While I mentioned above that you probably think you are handling the maximum number of projects that you could possibly juggle, it seems more are on the way. Additional tasks or assignments seem to be heading your way in the days and weeks after the new moon in Sagittarius, 21 degrees, on December 12.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>Good-fortune Jupiter is taking the lead at this new moon, and the saving grace is that Jupiter will reach out to action Mars. This is a lucky break because Mars, who rules your career reputation, will work closely with Jupiter in the most harmonious way, suggesting your performance will be stellar, despite the tensions you might feel. Your work could earn you a generous bonus or commission at year’s end (or by February). If you don’t work on a bonus or commission basis, you may get an increase in salary in February. A friend or your membership in a professional group may be instrumental in your impressive progress this month.</p>
<p>If you are out of work and looking for a job, you should be able to find something, at least on a part-time basis, to help with cash flow. Again, a friend may give you a tip that leads to a permanent or temporary project that could pay well.</p>
<p>To be clear, Jupiter and Mars will not make an exact aspect yet (that will happen on January 12 next month) but these two giants of the solar system will already be close enough (within mathematical circle of significance) to suggests career success is close at hand. This indicates the work you will be doing in December on a day-to-day basis will be adding up to a future victory that you will be proud to say you accomplished.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the coming months, if you can dream your desire, you can have your desire.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>I will admit that Neptune will try to throw glue into the gears by being in conflict with the new moon and Sun. Neptune, when in conflict, can be known to cloud matters and fog information, so after December 12 you will have to be absolutely sure of what you need to achieve. Ask questions and summarize all you have to accomplish to avoid re-dos and backtracking.</p>
<p>Clear communication will become vital this month for another reason—Mercury will be retrograde December 13 to January 1. Mercury will backslide in your sixth house of work projects, so Murphy’s Law will be in full effect: “If something can possibly go wrong, it will go wrong.” Every person of every sign will feel the oncoming haywire effects of Mercury retrograde, for Mercury rules all the elements that the world spins on—the day-to-day work we all do, including the facts and figures we need, the agreements we make, and the shipping and transportation that are needed to get the job done and delivered.</p>
<p>This means you need to shop early and get those gifts into the mail early as well. There will be weather delays and cancelations, miscommunications, errors in addresses, indecisive VIPs whose approvals you need—the list goes on. As said, we are all dealing with the same situation, no matter what your Sun sign. Mercury rules all electronics, which tend to act up when retrograde, so this is not the time to buy a new computer or smart phone. If you want to give a loved one a laptop, give that person a gift card and let your recipient choose their favorite product in January.</p>
<p>The major moment of the month will be the full moon in Cancer, 5 degrees, falling on December 26. This will certainly heighten your emotions during the holiday, for a full moon always delivers its news within two days before and five days after it occurs. On the upside, a glorious “trine” (a heavenly aspect of harmony and happiness) will occur on December 27 when Jupiter in your house of hopes and wishes reaches out to the Sun in your partnership house. This could suggest the best part of the holiday will be your interactions with family, friends, and your spouse or steady. In fact, you could come closer to fulfilling a wish that you have long hoped would materialize.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>Saturn, the planet of stability and long-term gain, will be in an outstanding aspect to both the Sun and full moon, which is also good news. Saturn is in your ninth house, so this suggests your international relationships will go well—foreign people and places are lucky for you, and not just for a flashy minute or two, but over the long haul.</p>
<p>If you are a Cancer that was born June 21-28, you will feel this full moon of December 26 most (covering the dates leading to Christmas, or those after the holiday).</p>
<p>Almost all month, from December 4 to December 29, “love me” planet Venus will glide through a sign that is sweetly compatible to your Cancer Sun—Scorpio. This suggests you will have many sparkly moments when you feel relaxed and know you are loved.</p>
<p>There will be one day (plus or minus one day) when your love life might be rocky. Uranus will oppose Venus on December 20. Sometimes people get edgy and out of sorts with the rush and tensions that build in getting ready for the holidays. Try to give your spouse, steady date, or even your child some slack, and don’t let a conflict spoil an otherwise lovely month (this aspect will hit your fifth house of true love, which also rules your children).</p>
<p>On New Year’s Eve, December 31, the transiting moon will be in Virgo in perfect trine angle to Jupiter in Taurus, and both will be in ideal, tight mathematical angle to the Sun in Capricorn. Together these three heavenly bodies will form a brilliant golden triangle in the sky—one of the best aspects you could hope to see. It looks like your spouse or steady date (if you have one) will suggest an idea of something to do together to ring in the New Year. It may be an idea that involves a drive to a destination not far from home to, perhaps, be with some of your closest mutual friends.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>Your partner might be a little mysterious, but let him or her lead the way. Enjoy not having to make all the plans. If you do not have a significant other, this will be a lovely night to spend the evening with a few friends, perhaps over dinner, and ring in 2024 with joy.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Just when it looks like all your friends on Instagram have sugarplums dancing in their heads and are skiing along gorgeous, whipped cream mountains, you appear to be back at the office and extremely busy. Mars is in your work-a-day assignment sector, keeping your hands on the steering wheel and eyes on the road. There will be plenty to do, and you might feel you don’t have enough time to get everything done at work or at home.</p>
<p>The new moon on December 12 will help you hire temporary recruits if necessary, and doing so could relieve a lot of the stress you may be feeling this month. You will have demands on your energy, so make sure you keep your health strong, and if your doctor suggests vitamins, take them. You began to see your little feathers dragging at the full moon last month, near November 27, so do all you can to keep your immune system in good shape.</p>
<p>This new moon on December 12 is also the time to devote a little attention to your pet if you have one. Pick up some treats and toys for your dog or cat, and spend some time together. The new moon lands in your sixth house and will help you unwind and enjoy the unconditional love your pet has for you. Also, a new moon exerts energy for weeks to come, so your pet could engender good feelings that will help you deal with all the stress of December.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>Keep in mind that Mercury will be retrograde from December 13 to January 1. You need to factor this in with all your planning for the month of December. Shop for gifts and ship your packages early if you hope to get them to your recipients in time. Travel may bring mounting weather delays as well, so if you’re going somewhere, leave for your destination a day or two early so that you, too, will arrive on time.</p>
<p>A full moon as big as a pizza pie in the sky will occur in Cancer on December 26. That full moon will be influential two days before it occurs and five days after. With a benevolent Saturn sending rays of stability and longevity to that full moon, you may be ready to make an important decision or promise to a person in your life who means a lot to you. Whatever you decide to do at this year-end period will stay in place almost forever.</p>
<p>Around December 26-27 a friend may reach out and help you in some important way that will touch your heart. The last week in December would be a wonderful time to have a gathering of any size because Jupiter will be in a glorious angle (a trine) to the Sun.</p>
<p>On New Year’s Eve, December 31, you have lovely, shimmering aspects, thanks to a golden triangle (what astrologers call a grand trine) linking the transiting moon in Virgo, Jupiter in Taurus, and the Sun in Capricorn. Spending the evening with close friends at an event a little drive away from home with your significant other would be lovely. If you don’t have a partner in your life right now, it still could be fun to be out with friends.</p>
<p>As the year draws to a close, take time to dream about 2024. You have Jupiter, the planet of good fortune (and even miracles), in your eleventh house of hopes and wishes for the first time in 12 years.</p>
<p>In the coming months, if you can dream your desire, you can have your desire. List small steps you can take in January to make that wish a reality. You will continue to have Jupiter at your side until May 25, 2024, so there’s plenty of time to lay the foundations for your plan. You are in a very special period, so dream big, and don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t have what you so dearly want.</p>
