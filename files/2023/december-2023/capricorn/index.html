        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>It is evident you’ve been working very hard, and around the recent full moon in Gemini last month on November 27 you appear to have finished up an important project. It may have been for work, but your chart is not clear about that—it might also have represented a major personal task.</p>
<p>The sixth house, which was accented during that full moon, also rules your health, so you may have caught a cold (I hope not). You appear to have had little choice but to overdo your schedule, working on all your required tasks with great concentration. I have noticed that when a cold (or almost any illness) presents itself during a full moon (like that one November 27, minus two and plus five days), you can expect a relatively fast recovery if you do what you can to get well. When a cold surfaces during a new moon, however, it tends to drag on for weeks. I want you to stay strong, dear Capricorn, so make it a point to give yourself a little more tender loving care by eating right and getting enough sleep. Alternatively, a full moon like the one that arrived in your sixth house on November 27 may have marked the end of a series of treatments, such as physical therapy.</p>
<p>As you begin December, action planet Mars will be touring your twelfth house, which he entered on November 24 and will remain until January 4. That area again emphasizes health, in terms of healing the mind, body, or spirit with the help of a doctor, or mental health by way of a therapist. Rehab is also covered by the twelfth house and is emphasized now.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>Mars’ position in your twelfth house tends to spark a yearning for privacy, so you may have interactions with medical personnel on your own behalf or act as an advocate for a friend or family member who needs medical assistance. It is alternatively possible that the medical person you visit is a veterinarian for your pet. Saturn was in hard angle to that full moon on November 27 (operative for an extra five days), suggesting that matters may not resolve naturally but rather that you need to take an active part in the process to reach a solution.</p>
<p>This area of your chart is also linked to the subconscious mind and is associated with great creativity when working in solitude. If you want to come up with imaginative expressions, by all means carve out some time alone so you can dip into the deepest regions of your mind to create your next project. This is not a collaborative house—the ideas should spring from within you and you alone. Your intuition will be unusually strong now, and it will help you in all areas of your life. If you have a strong dream, write down its plot and try to unravel what it means.</p>
<p>The twelfth house is also the place of planning for the future. It is the last house of the zodiac, completing a 12-month cycle, and it’s the area of your chart that always becomes emphasized just before your birthday. Ancient astrologers advised that this is the time to strategize about your future and decide what you would like to accomplish by this time next year.</p>
<blockquote><p>The full moon in Cancer on December 26 will bring warm and heightened emotions over the year-end holidays and allow you to focus intently and passionately on the person who is most dear to you.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>When Mars leaves Sagittarius and your twelfth house, he will go into Capricorn and your first house of personality, determination, and identity, staying from January 4 until February 12. That will be one of the most important periods of 2024 for you. You will enter an enviable position where, with Mars in Capricorn, you will have far more control over events. It will be a time when you can state your desires and go after your priorities with vigor, and others will want to follow you wherever you lead them. With Mars in Capricorn, you will more easily garner support from influential people who can help you, and it is considered a perfect time to launch new ventures—this will be true especially in January, a superb month.</p>
<p>All the topics I have discussed with you so far in your December report—brought on largely by Mars—will be given further emphasis and intensity during the new moon on December 12, also falling in Sagittarius, 21 degrees, in your twelfth house. You seem to be in a planning stage, standing behind the scenes, organizing, and strategizing but not yet in the spotlight. That will change by the time Mars enters Capricorn on January 4 to February 12, when you will have a more public persona.</p>
<p>This month, Mars will orbit close to that moon in Sagittarius on December 12 and give you the motivation to map out plans in detail. Neptune, however, will be a problem by being in hard angle to the Sun and new moon. You will have to make sure you are not overly idealistic about a certain offer, emerging situation, or relationship. More research will be necessary, and this certainly would not be a time to commit to anything. Do not sign a contract. One of the pitfalls of Neptune in hard angle to other celestial bodies is that he can make a situation foggy, adding confusion or misinformation. Or Neptune may obfuscate information completely. This would not be the time to sign a contract or to shake hands on any agreement. Not only will Neptune cloud reality, but Mercury will, too.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>Mercury will go retrograde from December 13 to January 1—beginning in Capricorn but quickly moving into Sagittarius. You will start to see delays, postponements, and cancellations crop up beginning a week ahead, so if you have any vital tasks that you need to take care of, complete as many as you can in the first week of the month. If you plan to travel, check to be sure your reservation will be held even if you arrive very late in the day. Confirm that your flight is on time, and consider putting Apple AirTags in your luggage so you can track your items should they become lost. Inclement weather could become an ongoing problem with Mercury retrograde, so realize that package deliveries will be slow—be sure to ship early.</p>
<p>The full moon in Cancer at 5 degrees on December 26 will bring warm and heightened emotions to the surface over the year-end holidays and allow you to focus intently and passionately on the person who is most dear to you. All full moons deliver their message between two days prior and five days after they appear (in this case, this month you will feel the full moon from December 24 through December 31). This full moon on December 26 will be a peach, falling in your seventh house of marriage and established committed relationships. In other words, this full moon will help you turn away from work, tasks, and other matters that occupy your mind and focus entirely and lovingly on your romantic partner, bringing you even closer. Many Capricorns may get engaged during the holidays.</p>
<p>The sweetest part of this full moon is that Jupiter will send the Sun a golden beam of generosity and happiness. Jupiter is currently in Taurus, your fifth house and truelove sector, and the Sun is in Capricorn your first house, which covers your vitality, personality, identity, and looks—this aspect is tailor-made for you! This Christmas and the days surrounding it will bring you the chance for breathtaking romance. You may be given a very valuable gift on Christmas (a check or piece of jewelry) because the Sun will receive such lovely aspects from Jupiter in your fifth house. Fun with children is also indicated because pregnancy, birth, and the care of children are all covered by this same fifth house of romance.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>Interestingly, your creative work is also nestled in this fifth house, and you may be working on a project dear to your heart in December’s last week. Whatever you do at the end of December will help you build a foundation for the future, for Saturn and the Sun will also be in beautiful agreement, and Saturn is your ruler, so that is extra good for you!</p>
<p>Although you will feel Jupiter’s influence on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, Jupiter and the Sun will make their perfect aspect together on December 27—a day sure to be dipped in gold. This aspect involves earth-sign celestial bodies, which are simply made for you—a four-star day, for sure!</p>
<p>On New Year’s Eve, the transiting moon will be in Virgo all day, a perfect placement for you. A golden triangle will appear in the night sky, linking the Sun in Capricorn, Jupiter in Taurus, and the transiting moon in Virgo (the third earth sign). This is as good as it gets! You will want to step out on this glorious evening and may even decide to take a memorable trip to foreign shores to ring in the New Year with your significant other. Even if you rarely plan something special for New Year’s Eve, you may want to consider doing so this year—it is sure to be a rare and wonderous moment in time.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Even though December is a very busy month for most people, you will find the pace very slow. Everything will speed up in January, but December will be made for planning. This might be good news, because you will have time to pull away from your desk and truly enjoy the holidays. You have been working so hard lately that it might take you two weeks just to get into the swing of the season.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>You likely finished a big project at the end of last month for there was a full moon on November 27 helping you put the final details on the assignment and get it ready to launch.</p>
<p>The new moon on December 12 is a gentle one. This is the time to map out 2024 and make a list of your priorities. Think about what you would like to have achieved by this time next year. You are a realistic soul because you are ruled by Saturn, and that will help you at this new moon, which is in conflict with Neptune. Other signs of the zodiac may be subject to wishful thinking at this time, but you rarely fall victim to being overly idealistic. You were born with clear eyes and the knowledge of how to accomplish things step-by-step. The December 12 new moon will bring confusing information, so everyone will have to do their due diligence to reach the facts—assume nothing.</p>
<p>Mercury will be retrograde from December 13 to January 1, so make sure you have purchased your airline tickets and many of your gifts, and have them shipped as far prior to the onset of Mercury retrograde as you can. Mercury retrograde is known to bring havoc, and you will want to stay clear of what’s coming.</p>
<p>Lucky you, you still have Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, in your fifth house of true love for the first time in over a decade. Jupiter will stay in this area of your chart until May 25, 2024, making you the most favored sign of the zodiac to find genuine love. If you have already found the one for you, you can make more of your relationship and strengthen your bonds together. If you hope for a baby, plan for a pregnancy before Jupiter leaves in late May. Jupiter’s presence in your fifth house encourages conception and birth.</p>




        <h2>Your December Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>Jupiter is also helping you lift your creativity to new heights. Love, children, and creativity all come tied with a red bow on December 27. On that day, you may experience breathtaking romance when Jupiter sends a golden beam to the Sun in Capricorn. Alternatively, this could be a standout day to give a party, large or small, for family or friends—or mixing them both together! Are you taking a restful vacation to cap off the holidays? Your timing is perfect—this trip should be quite wonderful.</p>
<p>The end of the month is going to be interesting for another reason. The full moon falls on December 26 in Cancer, the sign of home, but also the sign that lights up your house of marriage. Despite Mercury still being retrograde for a few more days, you have such strong aspects that you may receive (or give) a marriage proposal—with happy results. This full moon will be in effect from two days prior to five days after it occurs, making Christmas and New Year’s a joyous time of year for you when it comes to love. Plans you make at this full moon will likely materialize and bring you happiness forever because this full moon is in perfect angle to your ruler Saturn, the ruler of longevity. This should be a magical holiday season for you.</p>
