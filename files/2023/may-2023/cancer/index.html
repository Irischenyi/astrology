        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Not all full moons are friendly, and when you find a lunar eclipse, giving a full moon the strength of three, you have a very potent full moon.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The full moon lunar eclipse in Scorpio on May 5 will be a handful for just about everyone of every sign. This eclipse has a pulling away, separating quality to it, so changes will be in the air. Uranus, the planet of all things completely unexpected, will tightly conjoin the Sun, and together, Uranus and the Sun will both directly oppose the tender moon in Scorpio, 15degrees.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This full moon will occur in your fifth house of true love, so you may find the course of truelove is strewn with thorns. If you’ve been dating someone, whether for a short period ora long time, you may now discover your partner’s true character, and it might leave you shaken.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Lunar eclipses are known to shine a glaring light on any weak link they find within the house the full moon appears. If you have wanted to leave your partner, a piece of casually delivered news could mark the moment that you must let him or her go. Or it may be that your significant other checked out a long time ago, and the end of the relationship is at hand, only you never knew how your partner felt until now. It is always better to deal with truth and reality, but when news hits, that is easier said than done.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the fifth house rules more than romantic love. (Your fifth house does not rule married love—that’s a separate house not involved here.) The fifth house rules pregnancy, birth, and the care for children. You may have an unexpected problem connected with conception, or conversely, you could get pregnant by accident, so if that possibility concerns you, be very careful this month. Your fifth house also rules your creative expressions, and the topic of this full moon relates to your artistic side, so you may find that a problem as you get close to finishing a project.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Eclipses have a non-negotiable quality to them—you can never get things back to where they were before, so save your dignity. Accept the situation, and move on. It’s as if a puzzle piece falls out of the sky, and once that critical piece falls into place, the picture changes, and your entire understanding of the event shifts.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Eclipses sometimes “eclipse out” a person or situation from your life. You are likely to see things in an entirely new light. At eclipse time, something from the outside world can trigger the event, something that wouldn’t seem to have anything to do with the situation, but an event is set off from that outside, remote place, lands on your doorstep, and turns everything upside down in your life. Eclipses show us how interrelated we are to others and to the universe—even to things happening across the other side of the world.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Yet remember that eclipses sweep away all that is of no further value to your future. A situation or relationship may be perfect and complete—it might have run its course. With nothing new to learn, it’s time to end it. On the other hand, if a situation or alliance has been toxic or hurtful, the eclipse will carry it out of your life in the blink of an eye, doing for you what you could not do for yourself.</p>

        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever comes up will occur within five days of the lunar eclipse on May 5, or it could have already taken place around the time of the full moon on April 5. The change might instead come near the full moon on June 3. Astrologers work with bell curves, and that is why you can feel an eclipse one month before it happens (10 percent of readers) or feel it one month later (15 percent of readers), plus or minus five days in each case.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you would like to learn more about eclipses, I have an essay called “How to Deal with Eclipses” that you might find helpful. The essay is on my website and also on my app (“Astrology Zone Horoscopes, Susan Miller”). Find it under Life and Love, and then, you will see it on the menu in Susan’s Essays, go into that section.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is never wise to rush at eclipse time for they all have a second act, and you will get more information in a matter of days or weeks. This time you have other reasons not to rush.Mercury, the planet of communication, thinking, and perception, will be conjunct impulsive Uranus, urging you to act without thinking. The most important reason to slow down will be because Mercury will be retrograde in Taurus, a holdover from April 21, and will go direct May 14. Wait a few days after May 14 before you sign a contract or make other important moves. If you need to buy a car, computer, or any electronics, I would suggest you wait until May 21.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s look at Mars, which will be favoring you over all others as you enter May. Mars will be in Cancer and will stay in Cancer until May 20, a trend that started on March 25. Having Mars in your sign is an enormous advantage. Mars will give you energy and drive, and Mars will also make you more attractive to others. This eclipse is cutting into your precious time with Mars, for Mercury retrograde would not make this a favorable time to launch anything new, especially for work.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s move to one of the most important features of 2023. May 16 is an important date this month for it’s the day that Jupiter will move into Taurus for the first time in 12 years. Jupiter will see to it that you have much more fun socially. You’ve worked hard over the past year, and you’ve hit many home runs. You’ve felt the pressure of success, always hoping to follow each victory with another.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Now the pressure comes off. Over the coming year, from May 16, 2023, to May 25, 2024,Jupiter will be in Taurus, and your year will be filled with friends and time to focus on extending your professional network. In fact, the way you work will need a small adjustment in that it will be more important to circulate and show your face in your industry. Don’t show up in your office to stare at your computer. You are entering a very enjoyable social phase both personally and professionally.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Jupiter in Taurus will pour new people into your life, expanding your circle noticeably, and you’ll learn and grow from those you meet. Among new acquaintances, there may be one or two who you will want to know better, and you’ll become good, close friends. There is no doubt that this pal will become the best part of your life, willing to help you, encourage you, and introduce you to all the right people.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The ancients used to call the eleventh house, where Jupiter is entering this month, the house of joy. You are in for quite a treat. Jupiter, the good-fortune planet, will enter Taurus, and as an earth sign, he will blend beautifully and effortlessly with your water-sign element. Earth and water produce flowers! You will absorb the goodness of Jupiter easily.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Jupiter is moving into your eleventh house on May 16 to stay for 12 months. Your eleventh house is often the place in your chart where you receive a gift from the universe, something you dearly want, and only you will know what it is. It could be a new baby (spiritual) or a house or condo of your own (material). It can be anything. Think about what you would love to achieve—or take steps toward it—by the time Jupiter leaves on May 25, 2024. You are moving into a period of enormous reward, so think big in all phases of your life. Emotional happiness is absolutely possible now with more time for socializing and fun.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">All of Jupiter’s golden qualities will start to become apparent at the new moon on May 19 in Taurus, 28 degrees, when you will have FIVE heavenly bodies in your eleventh house. You will have Jupiter (happiness), Mercury (news), Uranus (surprise), the Sun (vitality), and the new moon (opportunity) all crowded into this part of your chart. You are ruled by the moon, dear Cancer, so that means the new moon weighs more heavily in your chart. Five heavenly bodies in one sector is literally half the solar system—a lot of energy! Unexpected, fun travel might be part of this trend sometime soon after the new moon arrives on May 19, for Uranus will be orbiting close to Mercury.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This month Jupiter will work directly with Saturn (to make their only exact aspect this year on June 19, but they are close enough to be significant after May 19)—a wonderful aspect that suggests your actions will have the possibility (and likelihood) of longevity.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">By June 1, transiting Jupiter will be conjunct the transiting north node, a mathematical point that suggests your life’s purpose. This aspect happens very rarely and always in a different zodiac sign, so I doubt that you have ever had this aspect in your life. (That is, Jupiter conjunct the north node in Taurus.) Be excited, dear Cancer!</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the first three weeks of the month until May 20, Mars, the action planet, will still be visiting Cancer, an advantage for you in all phases of your life. (Mars first entered your signon March 25.) You will continue to feel confident, energetic, and determined to reach your goals—and others will respond to you positively. You won’t take no for an answer, and by showing persistence, you can accomplish so much. Once Mars leaves Cancer, Mars will not return to Cancer until early September 2024. While you have Mars’ attention and support, lay out your plans to those who matter to you in your public and personal life, for you are more likely than ever to receive their full approval and support.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The first week of May holds a full moon lunar eclipse on May 5 in Scorpio, putting a spotlight on a close personal or business relationship. This eclipse will affect you if you are dating someone seriously and are at the point of deciding whether to continue the relationship. Alternatively, you may be thinking about having a baby or helping a child you have now, or you might be working on an important creative endeavor. Whatever is reaching a culmination will require a lot of your attention—emotions will surround the situation. Pluto in your financial eighth house will pressure this eclipse, so you may be concerned about the financial ramifications related to the matter that comes up.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Adding a great deal of pressure and difficulty to the May 5 eclipse will be Uranus in tight conjunction to the Sun and directly opposed to the tender full moon. Uranus will bring a completely unexpected and unwanted twist to the situation. The moon is your ruler, so you may be distressed by the words you hear. Eclipses bring truth to the surface to protect you and allow you to plan accordingly for the future. The full moon is in your fifth house of true love, so it points to someone you are dating seriously (but not to your husband or wife), or ithas to do with a pregnancy, a child you have now, or an important creative project.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On May 16, Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, will move into Taurus for the first time in over a decade. Your friends will surround you and offer you comfort and wise advice. For the coming year, your friends will be the golden part of your chart, for they love you and want the best for you—this will soon become obvious. Jupiter will remain in Taurus for a full year, until May 25, 2024.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">As hard as the news might be on or near May 5, things appear to change dramatically by the time the new moon arrives on May 19 when five out of a possible ten celestial bodies will cram into your house of hopes and wishes—the Sun, the new moon, Uranus, Mercury, and Jupiter, all in Taurus. At this point, your friends will begin to play a much larger role in your life, and you will enter a highly social time. On social media, you will increase your followers, and your life will start to feel easier and more fun.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This move of benefic Jupiter into Taurus will mark a turning point for Jupiter will leave your career sector, a place Jupiter has occupied for the last 12 months. In that time, you planted many important seeds for your career. You might have felt pressure because you were on display and wanted to prove your mettle to higher-ups. Even under the pressure, you were racking up so many victories that you were the apple of the eye of management. Now you won’t have to work so hard—so many of your goals can reach fruition—and you will have proven yourself at long last.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The new moon on May 19 will also help you grasp a goal that you’ve dreamed would someday be yours. After this new moon, be determined to commit to this aim, and don’t let any naysayer stop you from your quest.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of a committed relationship, such as marriage, you have finally become free of Pluto’s grip. Ever since 2008, you have hosted Pluto in your seventh house (ruling marriage and other partnerships), opposing your Sun at some point during that time. As Pluto started to make contact—and oppose—your Sun, and possibly other natal planets, you may have had to contend with a domineering, possessive mate or steady romantic partner or possibly with a difficult, demanding business associate, collaborator, or client. Pluto is about to finish with his tour of Capricorn. In March he moved into Aquarius to give you a preview of what’s to come in the next two decades. Pluto will reenter Capricorn, a difficult place for you, for just a little while—from June 11 to January 20, 2024, never return to Capricorn in your lifetime. You won’t be sorry to see him go!</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Once Pluto returns to Aquarius on January 20, 2024, Pluto will stay in Aquarius for 20 years. In this new sign, Pluto will help you increase your savings and investments, and if you expend an effort, you’ll learn to be a shrewd negotiator. Pluto takes 248 years to revolve around the Sun and go through all 12 signs of the zodiac, so you have never before experienced this influence. Pluto’s exit from Capricorn will make your relationships easier to navigate, and if you work with Pluto in Aquarius in the future, you can add to your net worth, pay down debt, and learn to invest carefully and wisely.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, Venus will visit Cancer this month for the first time in a year from May 7 to June 5. Celebrate by choosing a few new items for your wardrobe, and find ways to refresh your appearance—then step out to have fun with friends. Venus will add to your allure and magnetism, so enjoy this period. After you get through the eclipse, new love will be in the air, and with your prospects for a stronger, happier love life in the future, there’s no reason to stay home.</p>
