        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">As you enter May, see if you can clear your agenda so that it is not overloaded with important business meetings. Delay them until after mid-May. If I were a weather forecaster, I would say there are storms on the move that all signs will feel to some degree, so it would be best to have room on your schedule to quickly drop what you’re doing so you can pivot in a new direction.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A difficult eclipse is due on May 5 in Scorpio, your sign, your solar first house of personality and identity, at 15 degrees. If you were born on or within five days of November 8, you will feel this eclipse. This lunar eclipse is tied to the one you had last year on November 8 (yes, directly on November 8), so an unfinished discussion or plan from that time may come up again for you to polish off now. You can feel an eclipse one month earlier, so in the case of the November 8 eclipse, you could have felt it on October 8 or one month later, on December 8, plus or minus five days. Astrologers work with mathematical bell curves, so you can feel an eclipse before it even happens as it approaches.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of the May 5 eclipse, you may have felt it last month on or near April 5, or you will feel it on June 3, plus or minus five days. Only 10 percent of readers feel an eclipse before it occurs and 15 percent after it appears—so most, 75 percent, feel the eclipse on or very close to the day it takes place.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you can’t recall what you were doing on April 5, check your email and the photographs in your computer or smartphone to see the kinds of discussions you were having at that time. If, indeed, you notice important news, the May 5 eclipse will be tied to that theme.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">This eclipse may bring some sort of challenge from a person close to you. This may point to your committed romantic partner—specifically, your spouse—or a business partner, collaborator, or an expert you hired thanks to the Sun, Mercury, and Uranus all in your seventh house of partnership and all opposed to this full moon eclipse. This would not likely come from a person you just started to date as the house that is being accented—your seventh house—rules serious, contractually committed relationships.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Your seventh house rules partners of all kinds, and when this house is under difficult aspects, like it is with three heavenly bodies opposed to the May 5 eclipse in Scorpio, ancient astrologers referred to the seventh house as the house of open enemies. Today we call them competitors, but of course, they are still rivals. (The twelfth house of the horoscope is, among other, more positive things, also the house of secret enemies. For you, the twelfth house is clean and inactive these days.) You are fortunate in that you would be able to clearly see your rivals. They are out in the open, not concealed in the shadows, nor are they people you know but who have hidden agendas.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This eclipse might bring out a fierce competitor to vie for the job you want or, in the marketplace, someone who wants to steal a piece of your market share by making outrageous offers to lure customers. Fortunately, you would be aware of this person and his or her actions. I feel anyone clueless enough to challenge a Scorpio will soon be sorry. You are street smart, savvy, shrewd, and determined by nature, and you can easily take on a challenger. I want to emphasize this might happen but is not necessarily destined to happen. I simply want you to be aware of this possibility at the emotional full moon eclipse on May 5.</p>
<blockquote><p>With Jupiter in your house of marriage from May 16, 2023, to May 25, 2024, you will have a fabulous outlook for forming a strong, loving, marriage. If you are single, Jupiter’s entry into this house could benefit you, too.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Keep your health strong from the moment you enter May. You will need your strength to cope with whatever comes up. The first house rules not only personality but also your overall vitality. When you are under stress, it becomes imperative to eat nutritiously and to get plenty of sleep. If you don’t feel your best, you can’t think straight, and you won’t come up with a variety of creative ways to deal with the situation so you can then choose the best solution.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There is a positive side to this eclipse that you may or may not realize immediately but will in time. You will likely begin to see yourself—your talents, skills, experience, temperament, and proclivities—in a new light. Often we are so engrossed in life that we don’t realize we are changing and growing, and it often takes an eclipse to make us stop for a while and see the new, more mature, seasoned, and unique person we’ve become.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a useful rule of thumb for dealing with eclipses: You can RESPOND to someone’s dictates, but do NOT INITIATE any important ones. This is a time to sit back on the couch, open the window, and see what flies in. Do not worry about things that have not yet happened. That is not productive. We cannot control everything in life, so be practical and philosophical. Only be concerned about what has already happened, think about what your best response should be, and pinpoint the parts of the situation that you CAN control. Don’t rush—all eclipses have a second act where more information will be forthcoming within a few days or weeks.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There is another reason not to jump to a conclusion.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mercury will still be retrograde until May 14 in the very same area—your seventh house of partnerships. Often when Mercury is retrograde, we become forgetful or miss important details. Some facts may be deliberately obscured, and it is the job of an eclipse to shine a big spotlight on this hidden information. Still, not all facts come out all at once. That’s why it is never wise to make a quick, automatic response when a creative one would be more beneficial for you and others.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">You might see a partner in a new light during the May 5 eclipse, and here you need to stay as calm and realistic as you can. There is no use trying to bring things back to the way they once were—once the toothpaste is out of the tube, there is no way to get it back in. Eclipses are non-negotiable, and the only option you have is to move forward. You will learn about the true nature of this person, and once you receive this knowledge, it will be hard (actually impossible) to have the same estimation of him or her.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You might like to read my essay “How to Deal with Eclipses.” Many readers have found it helpful because it explains the unique nature of eclipses. It’s on my app called “Astrology Zone Horoscopes.” You would need the premium subscriber edition ($4.99 a month, or about one dollar a week) found on the Apple App store or Google Play. If you have the app, go to Menu, then to Life, Love &amp; More, then to Susan’s Essays. You will see my article there. I numbered every idea—each is a different piece of advice.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Now we come to the starring moment of the month—the move of good-fortune Jupiter into Taurus for the first time in 12 years. Jupiter will enter on May 16 and remain one year, until May 25, 2024. Jupiter expands all it touches and brings happiness and growth. Jupiter will be in your seventh house—the very same house that may give you problems at the start of the month with a romantic or business partner or with competitors. Jupiter is everyone’s favorite planet. His job is to make you happy, and he asks nothing in return.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I know Jupiter was rushing through airports to reach your seventh house in time to make the May 5 lunar eclipse easier for you, but alas, he is getting to you on May 16 (better late than never). If you were to have a shocking moment regarding your spouse, business partner, any other close collaborator, or a competitor, Jupiter’s entry into Taurus will give you reason to hope you can heal the problem with that person. If it were a competitor, you might come up with the perfect strategy to showcase all that you have to offer in a professional interview or by pitching a proposal for your career.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Jupiter will do more than that. As a Scorpio, you tend to like to manage all the details of various ventures alone. After Jupiter starts to spin its magic, you will learn that just because you CAN handle a lot of detail alone does not mean you SHOULD. When you do something new, it is often a good idea to invite others to share their experience and ideas with you rather than do everything solo. This may strengthen and smooth the process of what you are trying to accomplish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Jupiter’s entry into your seventh house will help you locate the perfect partners to further your goals. You may find a headhunter or job broker who understands your talents and works hard to secure the dream position you want. If you are in the arts or an entertainment sphere, you can find an effective agent, publicist, or social media manager to represent you. You may choose a new accountant or lawyer with a specialty you need. In the coming year, you will be speaking the word “we” more than the word “me.” You will be the better for it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you are applying for a job, you may present the idea of coming in as a package with another person. For example, an award-winning art director may suggest the talented copywriter who he or she has worked with, and together will win the award for best in show. If you are a screenwriter, you may take on a writing partner as so many do in Hollywood—this person will give you a sounding board to shape your characters in vivid, memorable ways. If you are a comic, think of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis or Jackie Gleason and Art Carney. These are examples of duos who were better together than they could have ever been alone.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In your personal life, if you are dating someone seriously, you will now have no reason to wait to get married. An engagement or wedding could take place between May 16, 2023, and May 25, 2024—a great time to do so. Just avoid Venus retrograde from July 22 to September 3, 2023.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Also avoid Mercury retrograde when planning a wedding: August 23 to September 15, 2023; December 13 to January 1, 2024; and next year, April 1 to April 25, 2024.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">With Jupiter in your house of marriage, partnership, and serious collaborations, you will have a fabulous outlook for forming a strong, loving, and prosperous marriage.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you are single, Jupiter’s entry into this house could benefit you too, in that you will finally start to meet marriage material—someone you could imagine bringing home to meet your mother and father.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In order to see the benefit of Jupiter, you need a new moon to start the ball rolling. Remarkably, you will have the perfect once-a-year new moon on May 19—a new moon in Taurus, 28 degrees. This new moon will have highly friendly Mars in Cancer, and that’s significant because Mars is one of your rulers. Your other ruler Pluto will support this new moon and the Sun in an out-of-sign trine (a heavenly aspect) and will also receive support from Neptune, the planet of unconditional love. This is all wonderful!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As an aside, Mars will be touring Cancer, a fellow water sign that blends beautifully with your Scorpio Sun, and will give you opportunities to make a distant trip. Mars will be in your ninth house, so if taking a quick getaway before Mars leaves on May 20 sounds enticing (to get away from the stress of May 5), then by all means go. This same position of Mars will give you help with legal advice and within the broadcasting and publishing industries, as well as with any pursuit you may have in higher education. Act prior to May 20 when Mars leaves Cancer.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">After that, Mars in Leo will light up your professional tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement for the first time in two years, from May 20 to July 10. This is a critical time for you to score a huge career advancement. Then keep your eye on the new moon on August 16 when all the pieces of your career puzzle will fit into place perfectly. You are heading onward and upward, dear Scorpio.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Venus will have the final say of how things go for Venus rules Taurus, the sign of the May 19 new moon. Venus will be in divine angle to Saturn, indicating a long-term union is possible if made after the new moon appears on May 19. Venus will also bring opportunity through her work with Mercury. (Mercury rules contracts and all written and verbal agreements—and marriage is a contract. Business consultants, experts, and collaborators usually sign a contract, too.)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Venus will also flirt with Uranus, the planet of surprise, to add sparkle and the element of serendipity on May 26, but they will be close enough by May 19 to form an aspect. Circle these two dates: The new moon on Friday, May 19, and Friday, May 26, for happy surprises regarding a relationship in love or business.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You have so much to look forward to, dear Scorpio!</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The beginning of May will mark a memorable moment in your timeline. A full moon lunar eclipse will occur on May 5 in Scorpio, your first house of personality, identity, and vitality. With eclipses, something ends and something else begins. Your life is evolving into a new chapter, and things usually happen quickly at eclipse time, especially at a full moon eclipse. This eclipse seems to center on a close relationship. It may be time to decide how you feel about your spouse or a sweetheart if you have been dating seriously. Astrology shows us that in this universe, all things move toward strength. If you are not sure how you feel about a certain relationship, this eclipse will give you full disclosure so that you can see it clearly. If it is time to give up on the alliance, you will know this for sure for the eclipse will give you additional evidence.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This eclipse will be no one’s favorite because Uranus will conjoin the Sun and oppose the tender full moon, a jarring set of aspects. You may decide whether you want to continue a relationship and find ways to make it grow or leave the alliance entirely. If it is strong and you are committed to staying together, you can make it closer and more secure. If this romantic relationship has been troubled, a couple’s therapist might be the answer, or if it’s a business relationship, a coach or lawyer may be needed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Often the universe will send us all a challenge to test our determination as well as our resourcefulness, and this is one of those times. You are a fixed sign, so change is not appealing to you, but with planets on the move, we all have to move with them. The May 5eclipse is related to the eclipse that occurred on November 8 and could bring talks from that time to a new stage. If your birthday falls on or within five days of November 8, you will feel this eclipse more than most Scorpios. Sometimes people feel an eclipse one month to the day earlier (10 percent) or one month to the day later (15 percent), but most readers (75 percent) receive the eclipse’s message within a week of the day it appears.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">If you are not in a serious romantic relationship, you may be in a close professional partnership with a business partner, agent, publicist, social media manager, accountant, lawyer, or other professional you would work with in a one-on-one, confidential way. Again, the universe will ask you if you are happy with this relationship. It is time to decide whether to make more of the relationship or let it go.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The hard part about this eclipse is its unpredictable, jarring, or chaotic nature, and you won’t see the news it sends you with the force of a geyser shooting up from underground.Uranus will conjoin the Sun, and that means your career is about to take a sharp turn in a new direction. Full moons are known to deliver a conclusion, and because this full moon is in Scorpio, you will know precisely what you want to do next.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The May 5 eclipse sets up a challenge, and it will not be an easy one to go through, but it will be effective in helping you move forward. Information will be revealed that you did not have—and when you get it, you might be shocked or surprised. Even so, this piece of information will help you make sense of a situation that may have puzzled you previously.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The new moon on May 19 will join the Sun, Uranus, Mercury, and Jupiter in Taurus where they will all greet this new moon together. Jupiter’s entry into Taurus is especially noteworthy as this is the first time you will have the planet of good fortune in your seventh house of marriage and partnership in over a decade, applicable to both love and business relationships.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Jupiter in Taurus will make Scorpio the most fortunate sign for marriage, so if you have been living with your significant other for a long time, you may feel this is the right time to wed. Certain business relationships will glow too, and you might make a change from a person you’re with now to someone new, or you may strengthen your current ties. Fortunately, your ruler Mars is presently in Cancer and will be friendly to the new moon and the Sun, energizing this new moon. A foreign person, lawyer, educator, or member of the media could be very helpful to you now, so keep your antenna up.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever you decide this month, move slowly. Mercury will still be retrograde in Taurus until May 14, a trend that started on April 21, which will force you to look at all sides of the situation. Many planets in Taurus will ask you to be practical and realistic. Don’t let anyone pressure you into making a quick decision.</p>
