        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Cosmic storms are moving in, and you will need to keep your schedule light as you start the month.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A full moon lunar eclipse in Scorpio, 15 degrees, is due on May 5, so until the eclipse delivers its news, you don’t want to be overloaded with tasks. You will need to be free to change plans and move in a different direction if necessary and direct others who will be willing to help you. You have been through many eclipses, but this one is strong and will bring unexpected events to everyone.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The May 5 full moon eclipse in Scorpio will bring Uranus, the planet of unpredictable news, in tight conjunction with the Sun (both will be in Taurus), and these two will be so close that they will be orbiting shoulder to shoulder. Mercury, your ruler, will be close enough to Uranus in Taurus to feel the volatility of this eclipse. Any time your ruling planet is involved, you would feel the aspect more than most. At the same time, Uranus and the Sun will directly oppose and challenge the full moon, a strong, nerve-jangling aspect.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The full moon will fall in your third house of travel, so this is no time to set off for a trip. Your third house rules short distance travel, often taken by car, rail, or possibly a short hop by air. All kinds of unexpected difficulties may come up, from mechanical problems to difficulties with people you will be interacting with at your destination. If you are traveling for business within days of May 5 and hope to reach an accord with a client, that outcome won’t be likely. Travel for pleasure probably won’t proceed smoothly either—especially if you’re going with a friend or sibling. See if you can put off your trip until there’s a happier time to go.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Your third house also rules communication and negotiation. Be careful about what you write in an email, letter, and on social media, and what you say and how you say it in person, both at work and in your private life. This will be a hot eclipse at the start of the month, and you could unconsciously trigger a meltdown of epic proportions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Also at this touchy eclipse, stay away from discussing controversial subjects. You may think your sister is wrong for favoring one political candidate over another, but your impassioned plea to see the light and embrace your political views won’t change her opinion. In fact, it could deeply damage your relationship. It would be best to keep your viewpoints confidential, especially at eclipse time when people will be feeling fragile. I have given one example, but I think you know what I mean.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Adding to the atmosphere of confusion, crisis, and fog caused by the lunar eclipse will be Mercury retrograde, a trend that started on April 21 and will continue until May 14. Mercury (remember, Mercury is your ruler) will be in a weak position, and your decisions and judgment could be off. You may misread a situation by being impulsive (blame Uranus), and that would only add to the confusion.</p>

        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Eclipses give an urgency to do something quickly, but you can often delay for a few days before offering an answer. It would be a disaster to sign papers at an eclipse like the one on May 5, plus or minus one week. This eclipse has a separating, pulling apart quality where people will leave a romantic relationship or a friendship, or you might move on from your present job or even the city where you live. Eclipses look for weak links and will enforce an end to any situation or relationship that it deems of no future benefit. If something has run its course, the eclipse will end it.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Always leave a space of days after Mercury goes direct before you resume your normal activities. All retrograde planets are at their worst behavior at the start and end of the retrograde period. On these “bookend dates,” as I call them, you will not get the positive result you imagine—waiting just a few days after the retrograde is over will more likely give you the success you hope to achieve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Turning to Mars now, the red planet has been in your friendship house since March 25, so you’ve no doubt gotten to see friends more frequently than you did during the first months of the year. This lovely social emphasis will last until May 20. I did mention that one friend may give you pause and be troublesome at the May 5 full moon eclipse, but overall, you seem to have a vibrant social life.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Jupiter and Pluto are coming to a harsh square on May 17, but everyone will feel this aspect all month. Decisions that were made at the beginning of Jupiter and Pluto’s current relationship that began in 2020 will now need to be tweaked and adjusted to align with present circumstances. Your finances and your daily work schedule will need to be streamlined. In government, you may hear of changes to municipal budgets.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s look at the new moon (not an eclipse) on May 19 in Taurus, 28 degrees, that will light your intellectual ninth house. At this time, you will have a whopping five heavenly bodies, which is literally half the solar system, crowded into one little sliver of your horoscope. That is a lot of energy in one place! Also, as a bonus—all of these celestial bodies will be in Taurus, an earth sign that blends beautifully with yours. Among the luminaries involved will be the new moon (opportunity), the Sun (strength), Mercury (news), and Jupiter (luck).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The planets in your ninth house will be on a mission to help you expand your worldview and see wider possibilities in ventures than you have in the past. There is a possibility that you will travel, and if you do, you are likely to go quite a far distance, possibly overseas. If you don’t travel, you may be on the phone or email with those in a foreign country. New moons open doors, and this new moon will bring a chance to work with others in another country.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There will be other opportunities, as well. Mars will be in a strong, solid aspect to the Sun and new moon in Taurus, 28 degrees, adding energy and a sense of purpose to your actions. Pluto will also be helpful in an out-of-sign trine from your work assignment sector to the Sun and new moon in your ninth house, an aspect of great harmony. Neptune, the planet of the arts, imagination, and creativity, will support the Sun and new moon too, showing that your creativity could impress and elevate your profile in your company or within a negotiation.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">The ninth house can also give you benefits in publishing and broadcasting, including the digital world. If you are involved in a court case, you will receive help and favor from this new moon in Taurus. If you are in graduate school or college or about to enter an institution of higher learning, this new moon will be highly beneficial to you as well. Remember to act after the new moon appears, not before. New moons bring chances for progress that had not been possible previously.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This new moon is strong and special—your life will go more smoothly for you after the new moon on May 19. If your birthday falls within four days of September 21, you will receive a double dip of benefit from May 19 onward in the categories listed above. The same is true if you have a natal planet in Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn, Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces at 28 degrees, plus or minus five degrees.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Jupiter’s entry into Taurus on May 16 is the most wonderful news of all for you, for Jupiter will shine in your ninth house of distant and international travel and relationships. Your ninth house also rules the court system, institutions of higher learning, and the publishing and broadcasting industries. These areas are where your greatest personal growth will lie in the coming year.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">How wonderful to have the planet of good fortune and happiness in perfect angle to your Sun in a fellow earth sign, Taurus. This will add ease, optimism, and lucky breaks to the year to come. Adventure and a much wider view of the world awaits you. Jupiter will enter Taurus this month on May 16 and stay for 12 months, until May 25, 2024. Wow!</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You have an enormous emphasis this month on foreign people and places, and you might need to travel to distant points or be on the phone or email quite a bit with people overseas. It seems this activity will most likely be for business. Still, if you do have to travel, schedule it for the second half of May.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A full moon lunar eclipse will arrive on May 5 in Scorpio. This will be a stressful eclipse for just about everyone of every sign because Uranus, the planet of unpredictability, will bepositioned on the other side of the sky, 180 degrees away, and directly oppose the tender full moon in Scorpio. Fortunately for you, Uranus, Mercury, and the Sun are all in Taurus, a sign that blends beautifully with your Virgo Sun. That will soften some of the unpredictable and chaotic aspects of this eclipse. You may be dealing with import-export, customs officials, immigration, citizenship, residency, or a travel or working visa. One of these areas may be coming to a culmination.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There will be other possibilities, too. The area of your chart so lit up—your ninth house—is also a hub of intellect and learning and can expand your worldview. You will see the greatest application for projects you’d previously perceived in narrow terms.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As an alternative focus, you may be thinking about a thesis you are writing or courses you are taking for a degree. Or your attention might be on finishing a publishing or broadcasting project that shows problems at the last minute, within days of the lunar eclipse on May 5. No one of any zodiac sign will be enthusiastic about this eclipse due to its propensity to bring untoward, unexpected news.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully, the new moon on May 19 brings a calmer outlook because five out of the 10 celestial bodies in our solar system will be in Taurus, a sign friendly to Virgo. However, caution will still be necessary, especially in regard to travel and business. Mars will make a sharp opposition to Pluto on May 20, indicating someone, most likely a subordinate, will challenge your authority or make demands. Yet at the same time, Pluto will support the Sun and new moon, suggesting that current company rules will be helpful. It seems you will benefit from legal advice.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It’s possible that someone is jealous of your success and will attempt to undermine your current efforts. You are savvy, and you can find ways to protect yourself. At first, you may not notice any of this person’s actions related to his or her hidden agenda, or if you do, you’ll dismiss those actions as juvenile and won’t think they require any strong action. Quite the contrary—it would be wise to take this person seriously and build a strategy to stay in control. Draw the line for what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Your ruler Mercury started to retrograde last month on April 21 in Taurus and will continue in its lazy, lackadaisical state until May 14. Hold off on making decisions and commitments until the second half of May. Avoid signing a contract of any nature, and wait to buy electronics for as long as possible.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Travel is apt to be difficult throughout the first half of May, and if you travel for business, your client could easily bring up obstacles or questions that you didn’t expect and aren’t prepared to answer. You will need time to do research to come up with a remedy that will offer a win-win solution for both sides.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">June will bring a better environment for progress, especially in your career, so delay serious business talks until then. If you want to take some personal time off, go after Mars enters Leo on May 20, to stay until July 10. Choose to take a quiet, soothing holiday in a natural setting. Planets in Taurus suggest you would enjoy hiking in a mountainous, thickly wooded forest, perhaps adjacent to a lake or stream for a refreshing respite from your everyday cares.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mars will be in Virgo from July 10 until August 27, marking one of the most important periods of 2023 for you. At this time, you will be very much in demand, both personally and professionally. For now you can rest, so take a week or two off in late May or early June because after the new moon on June 17, you will want to be part of all that is new and happening. By then you will watch the plans you made earlier start to blossom.</p>
