        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">As you enter May, you will have work on your mind. Expenses have been high for you, and you seem determined to find more money. Expenses began to climb when Mars first entered Cancer on March 25, and your high expenses will start to drop after Mars leaves Cancer on May 20.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You seem to be spending mainly on groceries or to care for your children. You could be buying property, but with interest rates so high, that is less likely, but you could be spending on repairs or for things you need for your home, from furniture to appliances. You may be sending money to help a grown son or daughter or to help an elderly parent or other relative. You might say that I have it all wrong, but this is what your chart is saying to me.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure not to buy any machines or electronics while Mercury is retrograde, a trend that started April 21 and will extend to May 14. Cars have become moving computers, so to speak, so avoid buying a car—new or used—or anything else mechanical. Avoid signing a contract or even making an agreement verbally, for in astrology they are the same thing. I have friends who rush to sign the day after Mercury goes direct, but that’s the worst time to sign. All planets are bad little rascals as they go direct—they need time to regulate their orb, so leave a space of a few days.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mercury is the natural ruler of your prestigious professional sector, the tenth house, so you may want to put your career on auto pilot for a while. However, when Mars moves through Virgo from July 10 to August 27, you will lay the ground work for exciting career progress. Don’t be on vacation! Do that in June! After weeks of talks (or interviews) from July 10 to August 27 (or if self-employed, scouting new prestigious clients), your career plans will begin to fall into place beautifully at the best new moon of the year on September 14 and the days that follow.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">As you begin May, you will come to the hardest eclipse of the year on May 5, arriving as a full moon lunar eclipse in Scorpio, 15 degrees. The fixed signs are more likely to have problems (Sagittarius is a mutable sign, a distinct asset at this eclipse), but you might hear a secret that someone has kept from you. A full moon in the twelfth house, where you have this eclipse, tends to bring concealed information to light.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is alternatively possible that someone close will be in a hospital, rehab center, physical therapy, mental health clinic, or other place of healing and confinement, and you will be interacting with medical personnel as their advocate. If not a friend or family member, then possibly it will be you who will go in for the care you know you need. If you have been seeing a psychiatrist to talk over a problem, this eclipse could easily bring things to the surface and help you create a breakthrough.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This May 5 eclipse will not be an easy eclipse, so at first you may not like what occurs, but in time you will see that, like any eclipse, it can be healing and cleansing. The universe works toward strength. The problem with this eclipse is that Uranus, the planet of unpredictability and rebellion that tends to bring news from out of left field without warning, will directly oppose the tender full moon in Scorpio and tightly conjoin the Sun and Mercury, both in Taurus.</p>
<blockquote><p>Crowded into your sixth house at the new moon May 19 will be the Sun, new moon, Mercury, Uranus, and your ruling planet Jupiter. Half the solar system!</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Your career will feel the tremors too, as there will be some changes at the office. This is why I urge you to keep your schedule light in the first week of May and stick to routine matters. You won’t have to cancel many meetings or worse, struggle to attend them while your mind is elsewhere on a more pressing situation. Whatever comes up seems to involve money, but keep in mind that your financial picture will improve later.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to changes at the office, it is possible, as one of many examples, that a woman VIP, a boss you liked and who protected you, may suddenly leave. (Eclipses of the moon—lunar eclipses—often “eclipse out” a prominent woman, the reason I made the example female.) Your work life will temporarily have a wild and wooly atmosphere.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Eclipses are non-negotiable, so you can never get events to return to the way they were in earlier times. These solar and lunar events are on a mission to find situations that will no longer add to your future—in other words, that relationship or experience has given you as much as was possible, and it has run its course. Eclipses are on a mission to create progress and a new future. With a lunar eclipse like the one on May 5, something ends and something else begins. The universe knows that in order to provide something new, you would have to make space by giving up something. Fortunately, the universe cannot tolerate a vacuum, so it will soon rush to fill it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s turn to the new moon on May 19 in Taurus, 28 degrees, which will bring better news. This is not an eclipse but a regular new moon. Crowded in your sixth house of work projects will be the Sun, new moon, Mercury, Uranus, and your ruling planet Jupiter. This is quite a lineup! Half the solar system!</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Your sixth house rules work-a-day projects, the people you hire who report to you, the physical place where work is done, and the tools used to get those tasks done. If you work in sales or have your own business, the sixth house also reflects how busy it will be (in your case, very!). This new moon will help motivate you to hire new workers, possibly purchase new computers, or to move to new headquarters. New moons bring fresh opportunities. Also, look at the sources and methods you use to see each project through to completion. Perhaps you can find a way to improve your approach.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that Jupiter is among the planets greeting the new moon on May 19 is great news. Jupiter will arrive in your sixth house on May 16 and remain a full year, until May 25, 2024. Jupiter is your ruler, which gives this placement more weight and importance to you. This is big news! Jupiter has not been in your sixth house for more than a decade, and soon you will notice the bountiful difference. Jupiter expands everything it touches—a little like Miracle-Gro® plant food.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you hire a new executive assistant or any other team member, that person will likely prove to be a gem. Companies often find it difficult to find qualified workers who also come with a good attitude, solid skills, an excellent work ethic, as well as energy, warmth, and enthusiasm. Once you locate that individual, hope that the company can afford to hire him or her.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is, you will be the exception to the rule. You will have no trouble finding people who can add sparkle to everything they do and who can fit into your department budget. Additionally, management may upgrade the office with a new paint job and a more modern look, lifting the morale of everyone who works there, including you.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">The sixth house is also the house of health—it rules the preventative measures you take to stay in good shape. Your other houses of health are the first house, which reflects your vitality and strength, the eighth house, covering surgery, and the twelfth house, which deals with places of confinement like hospitals or recovery centers.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This new moon of May 19 may encourage you to schedule your annual physical, including a visit not only to your general doctor, but also to your eye doctor and dentist to have the routine screenings you know you should do but haven’t come around to doing. You may be motivated to go back to the gym and purchase a membership after May 19, a great time to do so. You may alternatively take up a new sport by signing up for lessons.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This new moon can also help you to lose weight, for I have found Jupiter in the sixth house helps one drop pounds. (I know, this should make no sense for Jupiter expands what it touches. Still, in my empirical research, I have found Jupiter will help you eat more natural foods, less processed foods, in proper proportion, and the pounds just come off.) An astrologer in Europe saw me tweet this message and did his own research and was stunned to find out I was right. It could be a bonus you will enjoy from Jupiter if you added any pandemic pounds that you would love to lose. You might be concerned about doing anything strenuous on your body.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This house also rules small domestic animals, so if you have a little furry creature, plan to spend more time together after May 19, and perhaps schedule a visit to the veterinarian to be sure your little cat or dog stays in best health. After May 19 would be a good time to acquire a pet, too.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">You might be wondering about your prospects for romance. You have hosted Jupiter in Aries since last year, a wonderful privilege, and you may have met “the one” for you. Jupiter will exit this area of your chart on May 16. If you met someone during the time Jupiter spent in Aries, May 10 to October 27, 2022, and then returned December 20, 2022, to stay until May 16, 2023, take that relationship seriously—I see real potential. You certainly met at the right time. If you both are in love, you will stay in love.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you are married, you will have Venus in your marriage sector to May 7. Plan ways you can enjoy one another with fun things to do together. The most precious gift you can give anyone is your full attention.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As the month opens, keep your schedule light. A full moon lunar eclipse is due May 5, and it will bring with it unexpected news. You may need to drop what you are doing and attend to a different matter that will require your full attention. This eclipse is tied in theme to the eclipse that occurred November 8, 2022. This time, the May 5 eclipse may bring you information that someone close kept from you. Although you may be jarred when the truth comes out, once you know the secret, you can protect yourself in the future. You will need more privacy in the first week of the month while you come to terms with whatever news comes to light.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It might be easy to jump to conclusions, but don’t, as Mercury, the planet ruling communication, will continue to be weak in retrograde until May 14. Eclipses create confusing situations too, so wait until the dust clears, think about what occurred, and consider the various ways you can respond. In the meantime, more information will be forthcoming, for all eclipses have a second act. When the information is clarified, you may change your mind about how you feel about the situation. As a Sagittarius, you are a mutable sign, which means you are flexible and adaptable to change, and that will be an asset near May 5.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">You may feel drained by the news, another reason not to have a packed schedule. Be good to yourself by getting enough sleep, and make it a point to eat nutritiously.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You might like to read my essay about eclipses. Many readers have found it helpful because it explains the unique nature of eclipses. It’s on my app called “Astrology Zone Horoscopes”—you would need the premium subscription ($4.99 a month, about a $1.00 a week) found on the Apple App store or Google Play. If you have the app, go to Menu, then to Life, Love &amp; More, then to Susan’s Essays where you will see my article “How to Deal with Eclipses.” I numbered every section—each one has a different tip.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">The new moon of May 19 (not an eclipse) will bring changes in your everyday routine, such in your workplace or in regard to the methods and software you use to get your work done. Alternatively, a trusted person who reports to you may now announce her departure. (The moon is considered female, and a full moon eclipse may “eclipse out” your staff member.) This may be disappointing news as it appears that you rely on this person, and until you can hire a new recruit, you may have to shoulder a plethora of that person’s daily tasks yourself. This may seem like a terrible waste of time, but doing so will be necessary. Where the full moon eclipse on May 5 will mark an ending, the new moon May 19 will allow you to begin anew.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Your expenses have been high since Mars entered Cancer on March 25 and may become a little more pressing by Pluto’s opposition to Mars on May 20, the day after the new moon. You may have to pay more to replace an employee, or you may need additional computers, new software, revised sales tools and website, and so forth.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mars will move out of Cancer on May 20, so your expenses will soon drop once you get through May.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Be careful with new contracts that you may need to sign—planets in Taurus are warning you to have realistic expectations (in terms of eventual profits to be made), and be prepared to work creatively and with flexibility moving forward. Pluto’s square to Jupiter on May 17 and continuing to be close in coming months suggests that adjustments will have to be made in your business strategy as you go along. Keep a contract elastic enough to allow you hire people on a temporary basis so that you can respond to changes in the marketplace as business expands and contracts, possibly seasonally.</p>
