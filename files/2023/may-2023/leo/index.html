        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">This is going to be a wild month, particularly the first half. The May 5 full moon lunar eclipse might be troublesome simply because planets will be squabbling with each other and stamping their feet, causing the rest of us to feel the tremors. Eclipses bring life events that become milestones we long remember. Sometimes they bring happy news, and at other times, not-so-happy news. Yet their job is to bring progress and to uproot us from situations that have run their course and have no future value. It is time to move on and try something new.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This full moon lunar eclipse on May 5 will fall in Scorpio, 15 degrees, and will light your fourth house of home and family. This is a very difficult eclipse because it is a full moon which is, by nature, more emotional than a new moon. This full moon eclipse will be made even more volatile because Uranus, the planet of unpredictable news, will be conjunct the Sun, your ruler, and will oppose the gentle full moon in Scorpio.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, a large number of planets in the sky are in fixed signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius), signs that are known to resist change rather than adapt smoothly and easily. Eclipses are non-negotiable—you have to accept their dictates with no chance of getting things back to the way they were. Don’t even try to reverse a decision to return to the good old days—those days weren’t actually that great. The planets are always on the move, and we must be, too. The only path available is forward, and admittedly, when changes come so quickly, it can be painful to accept, but in time, you will find the eclipse acted in your favor, helping you do what you could not do for yourself.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It’s best to be as practical and objective as you can, so try to contain your emotions (not easy, I know, dear Leo). Focus on the elements you can control, and do not worry about those you cannot. Also at eclipse time, there is a golden rule. You can RESPOND to other announcements, demands, and so forth, but you must not INITIATE any during an eclipse because things rarely work out as planned at eclipse time. Let other people make the announcements and major dictates—you can simply respond to the new circumstances or news.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">The fourth house of home rules your physical house, other properties you might own or rent, your plans to sell property, the things you buy to place in your home, and your personal family dynamics. In this eclipse, you may hear from your landlord that your apartment building was sold, and you have to move. Or it might be that you are offered a great job, but to accept it, you would need to find a new apartment in a different region. Conditions with family (and your obligations to them) may pose a quagmire that you will need to sort out. In another example, you might be happy to stay where you are but be told you have a major repair you must undertake. Another way this eclipse could affect you is if you have a roommate, he or she may decide to move.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The fourth house of home also rules your parents or those you view as parents. It may be that your normally healthy, spry mother will need medical attention, or your father may ask you to help him find a suitable assisted living facility. Alternatively, a relative’s long buried secret may become known, causing some people in the family to have a hard time adjusting to the new reality.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Uranus rules your seventh house of marriage and will be on a rampage, so you might have problems seeing eye to eye with your spouse or close committed (by contract) business partner, agent, publicist, accountant, lawyer, or other person with whom you have a one-to-one confidential relationship and is equal to you (not someone at work who is a subordinate and reports to you). Even though I have tried to give you some examples of what might come up, it is usually futile to do so, for Uranus always chooses a completely unexpected piece of news regarding something you’d never look at as a possibility. The news always seems to come out of left field.</p>

        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Mercury has been retrograding since April 21 and is still out of phase, so everyone’s thinking is likely to be flawed. It will be easy to jump to conclusions, but because eclipses stir up dust, it will be hard to sort out fact from fiction. Take your time, and don’t make any major decisions until a few days after the date Mercury goes direct on May 14.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Turning to Mars now, the action planet, it seems Mars has been keeping you in a behind-the-scenes role, but as a Leo, you are less comfortable waiting in the wings for the curtain to go up and the action to begin. You want to step onto center stage and start putting things in motion. You are still in a planning stage, however, but the good news is that you will leave your low-key position once Mars moves to Leo on May 20, to stay until July 10. Those weeks could be your most important period of 2023 for you will have a commanding presence and be energetic and ready to take on the world. When Mars is in your sign, people sit up and listen to what you have to say, and they tend to approve your proposals.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The only hard day through that time will be on the day Mars enters Leo (May 20) for Mars will be in direct, 180-degree opposition to Pluto, a possibly explosive aspect. This might set up a conflict or power play with a person who is close to you, such as your spouse or a colleague, associate, or an expert you hire and deal with regularly in business. If you keep a low profile, you will be fine.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Now we get to the most exciting part of the month—the coming new moon in Taurus, 28 degrees, set to light your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement on May 19. This new moon will give you the chance to advance through a promotion, or you may be given a new, high-level, prestigious career position.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">If you are self-employed, you will give yourself a promotion by bringing in a high-status new client, one that impresses competitors. Whether you work for yourself or others, at this time of the month you will have five celestial bodies clustered together, which is half the solar system, in one house! Those heavenly bodies will be the mighty Sun (focus and strength), the new moon (opportunity), Mercury (news), Uranus (surprise), and Jupiter (good fortune). Your timing for making a move up the ladder of success is excellent.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The arrival of Jupiter to your tenth house of career is newsworthy. Jupiter took 12 years to journey to this part of your chart, and soon you will begin to see the benefits. In order to unlock Jupiter’s treasures, you would need a new moon in your tenth house, and guess what—that is precisely what you have! You have the perfect new moon (not an eclipse) to energize your career on May 19.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Uranus is still orbiting near the sun (not tightly, but still within the orb of significance), so that suggests you will have a few surprises coming up on the path to your new position. You are ruled by the Sun, and you may be tempted to act impulsively, but even though Mercury will be done retrograding by time of the new moon on May 19, it still would be wise to take your time and study all facets of any proposal offered to you.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mars will be in the perfect position to support the Sun and new moon, so that will help you get the attention of VIPs who favor your need to make career strides. Neptune will be in a lovely sextile position, indicating a chance to leap ahead and impress VIPs by displaying your artistic talents and contributing your imaginative ideas.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">I had mentioned the conflict between Mars and Pluto earlier—that could manifest through determined (and even ruthless) competitors. Someone seems jealous of your progress and talents and will do almost anything to nab the position (or client) you have in mind. I don’t want you to be overly concerned about this, but just keep an eye on what’s going on around you.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You have an ace in your pocket by having Jupiter at the pinnacle of your chart. Jupiter is the planet of reward, so everything you have done in the past to get ahead will come into play now—your work ethic, your excellent judgment, all the experience you’ve gained, and the creativity you have displayed. Sometimes you have to give up something to create space in your life so that you can receive the gifts of the new moon. Once Jupiter arrives, he will crown you the cosmic favorite for all career matters. You will receive lucky breaks, and influential people will go out of their way to help you. In fact, one high-level person may offer to make introductions for you. A colleague, client, or boss may believe in you with such conviction that you will gain confidence and begin to see your potential in a new light.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There continues to be a possibility at this new moon that you will have to address your living situation, which might be changing. In a different instance, you may need to consider how you will handle your new job while you’re also finding a way to care for an elderly parent or looking after your small children at home. This is all due to Pluto’s position. You may see evidence of this at the new moon on May 19, and although family or home living matters can be tension-producing because everything seems so new, I feel you’ve got this, dear Leo. You are a masterful manager, and once you get into the nitty gritty of the situation, you can solve the questions that come up.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You can always enlist the help of a real estate broker or other professional if necessary. You seem to be dealing with a lot of change all at once, and it is not that you planned for all this change on so many fronts simultaneously, but that’s how it seems to be happening anyway. When you go through periods like this, you have to find others with more experience and expertise to offer you advice. You may regret having to spend money to hire professionals to help, considering the time crunch you seem to be in, but they may be able to help you avoid mistakes and save you money in the long run.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">The hardest part of the month will be the cranky full moon on May 5 in Scorpio which is in conflict with the other planets. After that, the month will improve steadily.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I wrote an essay “How to Deal with Eclipses” that you might find helpful. You can find it <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/all-about-eclipses-a-guide-for-coping-with-them/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.astrologyzone.com/all-about-eclipses-a-guide-for-coping-with-them/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1683126353296000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3-E41pMK1bLT655sVJxjDt">here</a> on my website. It’s also available on the premium version of my “Astrology Zone Horoscopes” app, which you can download from either the Apple App store or Google Play (it’s $4.99 a month, about $1.00 a week). Just go to the Menu, tap on Life, Love &amp; More, and then tap on Susan’s essays. Many readers like that I number each idea about eclipses.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">By the time the month ends, you will feel much more confident that you can handle anything life throws your way, and you will emerge stronger than ever.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This will be an extraordinary month for you. Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, will enter your tenth house of fame and honors on May 16 to remain for a full 12 months, until May 25, 2024. This sector that will be so vibrant for you will be positioned at the very apex of your chart, raising your profile, and it will give you the chance to showcase your professional talents. This is the first time in more than a decade that you’ve experienced a visit from this planet of good fortune in your prestigious career sector.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At first you may doubt that this month will be special for you. The reason is that a rather unpredictable full moon lunar eclipse will arrive on May 5. It will not be a friendly eclipse because Uranus, the planet of unexpected news, will directly oppose the tender full moon. At the same time, Uranus will conjoin the Sun, and the Sun is your ruler.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">A situation involving your home, other property you may rent or own, or a family member will likely require your immediate attention. This news won’t be anything that you would have predicted could happen—it will come from the outside and likely have nothing to do with any actions or decisions you’ve made. Instead, it will have to do with something going on behind the scenes, unknown to you or those in your circle.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Uranus’ role at this point will be to test your resourcefulness and your abilities to make decisions on the fly. The new moon solar eclipse that occurred last month on April 19 in the last degree of Aries, 29 degrees, will begin its work by this month to mark a critical transformation point for your future professional success. The new moon on May 19 will trigger opportunity and will be bolstered by the Sun, Uranus, Jupiter, and Mercury—quite a lineup of cosmic support.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Pluto will be in agreement with the Sun and new moon on May 19 (but Pluto will be in opposition to Mars, an explosive aspect). You may be dealing with a ruthless and unethical competitor who will do anything to try to take from you what is rightfully yours.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It looks as though you may need a middleman to unlock your career breakthrough—a headhunter, job broker, agent, publicist, or even a family member—so be open to a collaboration. Pluto is closely associated with big money markets and also masses of people and government, so you may find a public program that could benefit you.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever deal or job you are discussing this month will likely pay a substantial salary due to the proximity of Jupiter to Mercury, the ruler of your solar second house of earned income. Additionally, a new moon in Taurus on May 19 will name Venus as pivotal to this new moon’s eventual outcome as things play out in the coming weeks and months. At this new moon, Venus will have a friendly conversation with Saturn. Hence, you can stabilize your financial future by the actions you take in the second half of May.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Saturn is in your eighth house, so as your income grows, consult an accountant for advice on the amount of money you should put aside for taxes as you rise to higher echelons of wealth.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You are on a great career track, dear Leo. While you may have a few events rattle you early this month, causing you to instantly doubt all that I am saying (that so much good is coming to you), you will see pieces of your puzzle fall into place as you get into the second half of May.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Opportunity will continue to come to you starting with the new moon on May 19, 2023, and happily, your fantastic cosmic favor will last until May 25, 2024. Increasingly, you will find yourself at the right place at the right time, possessing all the necessary skills and talents. Be ready!</p>
