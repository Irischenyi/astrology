        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">This is a busy month. It holds the second of two eclipses—the first one arrived last month on April 19, and it was a new moon solar eclipse in Aries at 29 degrees. It was a friendly eclipse, although all eclipses nearly always require change and adjustment, something a fixed sign like yours, Aquarius, might not always look forward to. You are hardwired to hold up the structure of things, not suddenly dismantle them, but sometimes that is necessary. The April 19 eclipse will bring about a positive outcome because it arrived so closely orbiting to Jupiter, the planet of good fortune.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Now we come to its twin, a full moon lunar eclipse on May 5 in Scorpio at 15 degrees. This one is far more demanding and difficult than the one in April. This eclipse will light your tenth house of career honors, awards, and achievement, so your job, reputation, and status in your company and the industry at large will be your focus. Full moons bring culminations and usually represent a situation that has been going on for a while without resolve. Now things will start to get settled.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This is a tricky eclipse because of the tension between home and career that seems to be shaping up due to Uranus conjunct the Sun, and both are in tight opposition to the full moon. It may be that you will be chosen for a very prestigious position but feel torn because of obligations you have at home with children or other family members, such as a parent who depends on you.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Pluto, in Aquarius until June 11, will, at the eclipse, press on the Sun and full moon, indicating a partner at work (agent, publicist, collaborator, expert, coach, business partner, accountant, or lawyer as some examples) or at home (possibly your spouse) and only add to the pressure to decide, considering the conflict you might start to feel concerning work verses home. In another manifestation, instead, you might have to move house or do extensive repairs or renovations for any number of reasons, and all this is happening when the job culmination and possible offer are coming up.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">There are other challenges to solve. The moon in Aquarius’ chart governs the people you hire to help you perform necessary duties in your life (sixth house). That person might be your executive assistant at work or your nanny or housekeeper at home. Whomever it is, this person may announce a departure suddenly. Everything that comes up on or within days of the May 5 eclipse will be sudden and unexpected. This person will be one you trust and depend on. Their departure will have you scrambling to find someone to replace them, but you may suspect it won’t be easy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You may feel that too much is happening at the same time, yet this is life, and often many conditions will collide. The only way to deal with this is to break down the situation into small pieces and priorities. Never worry about things that have not happened and perhaps never will—that will keep you sane.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At eclipse time, you may be tempted to rush, or you may feel pressure from someone near to hurry up and make a decision. Eclipses kick up so much dust it is hard to clearly see the road ahead, so bargain for a few days in order to think and plan.</p>

        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">See if you can go to a quiet place for an hour, such as a peaceful, quiet park. Or go to a church, dimly lit with candles and soft light coming through the stained-glass windows. Alternatively, you might prefer going to a café, muse about the future over a cup of coffee, and jot down ideas as they come to you.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I believe the job that might be offered to you at this juncture would be a dream job, but you might have to figure out how you will handle family obligations This may require asking home-care workers to stay longer until you are over the transition. This will cost more, but on that score, things look good—you may be making more.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Until you are settled, with Mars in your sixth house until May 20, you will be able to pick up independent work to keep money coming in. While Mercury is retrograde (until May 14), go back to people you used to work with and enjoyed, for they may have the perfect project to offer you.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you lose your job, or if you keep your present job but see a favorite boss be “eclipsed out” (which is what eclipses do), you nevertheless have reason to be optimistic. You will be able to find something better. In either case, I see that you can parlay your past experience into an exciting new job.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Many Aquarians go into areas where new technology plays a big part of the job. Aquarius rules computers, space, and television. Now that movies are digitized, moves are included. If you are among the many film and TV writers in Hollywood who go on strike May 2, Mercury will be retrograde until May 14, so it would be wise to allow talks to continue at a leisurely pace for at least that long.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You will need time to listen to both sides of the situation. With both Mercury retrograding and the May 5 eclipse happening too, this could add up to an environment of confusion. It would be hard to see the road ahead. All eclipses have a second act, and additional information will be forthcoming several days (or a few weeks) after the May 5 eclipse—a good reason to go slowly.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You may be about to examine very important matters including streaming, digital delivery, and the role of AI. Some of these technological advancements, like AI and ChatGPT, are so new that no one can say for sure what their final influence will be. We can see the benefits, but we need to consider the pitfalls too, on both sides of the bargaining table. The world will be watching for the solution, even if it will turn out to be a temporary one that will be in place for just a few years.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The picture will improve substantially in the second half of the month. Also, with Uranus, your ruler, and Pluto on a rampage pointing their anger at the full moon eclipse on May 5 in Scorpio, everyone on will be feeling a little unhappy, frustrated or fragile. Get beyond this eclipse, and keep looking for workable solutions. Scorpio is a big-money sign, so of course, the financial implications of any change will be at the forefront.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s turn to look at one of the big treats of the month—the move of Jupiter to Taurus for the first time in 12 years. This will automatically make you the sign that will be luckiest in matters related to home, real estate, and family matters. If you are looking to move, Jupiter will see to it that you find a large, sunny space with big closets in a neighborhood you like. Jupiter is, after all, the planet of good fortune whose only job is to make you happy. If you are renovating, you will adore your new home. Make sure you do it while Jupiter is with you for a full year—from May 16, 2023, to May 25, 2024.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you love the home you are living in now, you might buy or rent a vacation home or other property. You might redesign your present décor, give several rooms a fresh coat of paint, or buy a new piece of furniture—one you always wanted—and you may even find this expensive item you love on sale. Jupiter not only gives you the opportunity but the means to take advantage of your good fortune.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">During this long 12-month visit of Jupiter, you will also have wonderful family support for your goals. For example, if you are buying your first home and you don’t have quite enough money for the down payment, your parents may be willing to give you a piece of your eventual inheritance now so that they can see you enjoy your new home. I know that interest rates are currently high, but you may be able to negotiate with the seller to settle on a lower price so that you can afford to buy the house you love.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">If you are looking for a roommate to share the rent, who you find will likely be someone that you get along with quite well. Be sure to put a contract in place at the start.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Because Mercury will be retrograde in your home sector until May 14, a trend that started last month on April 21, do your best not to sign any important papers in the first two weeks of the month. Always leave a space of days after the retrograde is over because Mercury is a clever little prankster at the official start and end dates of the retrograde.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you have to sign while Mercury is retrograde because you would lose the opportunity, then you won’t have a choice—you must sign. It seems you will want to make corrections to the agreement later, if that is possible. In this case, have a short contract, if that would be appropriate (such as a rental lease for your apartment). Your lawyer could build in a “what if…” clause and also try to get an exit clause approved, should you become unhappy later during the term of the agreement. These provisions will apply mainly if you have to sign when Mercury is retrograde. You are being protected by Jupiter in matters of real estate and family conditions, and that is quite an asset. Still, I can’t see everything in your chart (you may have a natal aspect that’s somewhat glitchy), so I am being extra careful here.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s consider how you can get Jupiter to shower you with golden confetti! A glowing planet like Jupiter would need a trigger—an interaction with another planet or, even better, a new moon in the sign and house that Jupiter is residing in now (Taurus, your fourth house). A new moon would be powerful and be able to unlock Jupiter’s cornucopia of riches for you. You typically get only one new moon in each house of the horoscope within a year. You need one in your fourth house of home.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Guess what!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You will get that perfect new moon on May 19 in Taurus, 28 degrees, just three days after Jupiter arrives in Taurus on May 16. Wow!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This elegant new moon will be flanked by the Sun, Mercury (news), Uranus (surprise) and Jupiter (happiness and outstanding luck). That is exactly half the solar system! When it comes to home and family, this is where your full attention will be, and rightly so! If you need to make changes at home or in regard to assisting a family member (or vice versa, if you need a family member to help you) this will be your moment to act, just after May 19. Pluto and Mars will be at loggerheads on May 20, so let that day pass and aim for May 26 when Venus will be in sync with your ruler Uranus.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Your ruler Uranus will be in a wide (9-degree) conjunction to the Sun, so there still will be a few surprises, but they’re not likely to be difficult, like what Uranus was up to earlier at the May 5 eclipse. The Sun rules your partner (spouse or live-in sweetheart), so your partner is where you’ll get unexpected news. This entire month seems packed with surprises.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Venus will assume the dominant role at the May 19 new moon in Taurus. This is exceptional good news for Venus will be in sync with your ruling planet Uranus. This suggests that you will like this new moon, which will be influential for six months but strongest at the end of this month, for it very gradually will use, and eventually and slowly deplete, its powers by the time we reach the full moon in Taurus October 28, which coincidentally will be the very last eclipse in the Taurus-Scorpio family of eclipses.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">You are about to have a big month—career will bring news, change, and opportunity, with home and hearth being a place of love, warmth, and outstandingly good luck.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You have been handling a lot lately, for the eclipses in Scorpio and Taurus have been working to bring considerable change since they began coming by every six months since November 19, 2021. You may need to change jobs, take on more clients, move house, or sell property, as some examples.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A difficult full moon lunar eclipse is due on May 5, and it is linked to events that might have happened at the previous eclipse in this series, which occurred November 8. That eclipse might have delivered its message near October 10, November 8, or December 7. The full moon lunar eclipse of this month, May 5, will bring changes to your professional life.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You are a fixed sign, and the signs of the current eclipse family are fixed too—Taurus and Scorpio. While you may have faced a loss or untoward change during previous eclipses, this month seems to point you in the right direction, to a place you can be appreciated and to create a home life that is truly fulfilling.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">This eclipse of May 5 will be in Scorpio, similar to an eclipse you had last year on May 15 in Scorpio and as said, tied to the theme of the one last year on November 8. You have watched your career undergo a number of changes since this family of eclipses first started in November 19, 2021. Now at this point, you will likely need to make additional tweaks to your career and choose a new direction or a way to get fresh experience.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The hard part of the eclipse is that it will bring completely unexpected news. Everyone of every sign will likely be dealing with some level of surprising, if not shocking, news. Uranus will test your resourcefulness, flexibility, adaptability, and willingness to turn on a dime when necessary. A superior you admired, an executive who has always protected you, may announce a departure. Or your company may announce a streamlining effort with dozens of layoffs. You might be glad to leave, or you might be chosen to stay, and if you do, you will likely take on greater responsibility.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Pluto will be in a grumpy mood and might bring a demanding, difficult person into your life and make the process of addressing career matters more difficult. If you get a new job, there seems to be some sort of negotiation about your salary, so you may have to ask for a higher salary so you can eventually settle on one you can accept.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Saturn is in your solar second house of earned income, suggesting some VIPs may be in a frugal mood and will try to get you to agree to a lower salary than you feel is fair. You can make progress if you come up with reasons why you are worth a greater salary. You need to convince the person who is in charge of the purse strings that you are worth the investment the company will make in you.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">The new moon on May 19 will fall in the very place that has given you concern in past weeks or months—Taurus, your fourth house of home and family. The extraordinary part of this new moon, however, is that Jupiter will have entered this sector only three days earlier, on May 16, shining his golden light there for a year to come, until May 25, 2024.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Jupiter will crown you the luckiest of all signs for real estate transactions whether you want to buy, sell, or rent a new residence or vacation home. This trend will also help you refresh your present home or other property with a renovation, new décor and furniture, a new landscape design, or needed repairs as some examples. You can choose which options appeal to you.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Your family will give you great support for your goals now, and if you hoped to help a parent with a lifestyle transition, you can do that, too.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This new moon sends mixed messages, and that shows that you will have a few obstacles to get over before you can sit back, relax, and reflect on how well you handled this episode. If you are persistent, you can overcome the roadblocks. Pluto will be in a conflict with Mercury and Jupiter, so you may have to do some financial restructuring, but those changes will be necessary and bring you to a better place. Saturn will be in fine angle to Mercury, which means that you can get to a place of financial security if you are determined not to give up. Powerhouse Pluto’s friendly attitude to the Sun and new moon offers an additional hint: Look into government programs that can help first-time home buyers achieve their dream.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There are lots of changes coming, but also lots of benefits once you get to the new places you are heading in your life. Trust in the universe, and in yourself.</p>
