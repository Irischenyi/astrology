        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">The beginning of the month won’t be easy. A full moon lunar eclipse will take place on May 5 in your opposite sign of Scorpio, so a close relationship partner will be the focus and likely bring unexpected stress. The partner you will be thinking about may be your mate or a business partner/collaborator. This person seems to be leaving your everyday life, possibly quite suddenly. Often an eclipse will “eclipse out” a major person in our lives. There are a variety of reasons this could take place. A favorite boss may be moving to a new part of the country to take another job. You may break up with a romantic partner if you feel betrayed or unfairly treated. Eclipses look for weak links and home in on them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Pluto will be in the mix too and will send a 90-degree square aspect to both the Sun and full moon lunar eclipse. This will add pressure from work, and I am so sorry to have to transmit this information. Everyone will feel these aspects circulating in the air, so be gentle with everyone you interact with this month, especially in the first half of May. Most people (although not all) will be walking on eggshells and feel a bit fragile.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You may have had difficulty last year near November 8, 2022, the date of an eclipse that was not so nice. This May 5 eclipse is a full moon, so emotions will run high, and is the hardest one of the Taurus-Scorpio series—nothing will be as dramatic as this one the rest of the year. Mercury in retrograde will be orbiting close to the Sun and Uranus and will be opposed to the full moon, so the planets are not getting along.</p>

        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">There is usually one helpful planet in any lunation, and fortunately, Scorpio’s ruler Mars will be quite friendly and could be the saving grace here. Mars will be in your third house, which rules your siblings. The third house also rules your neighbors. At least one individual in either category will give you good advice, and possibly solid help.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The third house, being stimulated in an affirming way in your chart by Mars, is also the house of communication, so you will find the right words to express any thoughts or feelings. If you manage to get publicity, you might not agree with the journalist who wrote it (parts may be different from your own perspective or simply wrong). Blame Pluto (remember, he’s sending a difficult square to the eclipse). Cheer up by reminding yourself that some people say any publicity is good publicity. That’s not always true, but the theory is “talk about me, just don’t ignore me!”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I think the May 5 eclipse will have sudden news related to your living quarters or with a family member. I say that because the Sun, which is being touched by Uranus, rules your home sector. Remember the rule you can apply to all eclipses: Respond but do not initiate. Don’t worry about things that have not happened yet. Keep your schedule light. I feel it is best to open the window and see what flies in. If your birthday falls on or within five days of May 5, you will notice the effects of this eclipse regarding a relationship and possibly also with family.</p>

        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Remarkably, you are moving into one of the best periods of your life, and the date it begins is a little later in the month, May 16, when good-fortune planet Jupiter reaches Taurus after traveling for 12 years to get to your constellation. If you receive news that rattles you at the May 5 eclipse, know that a year-long period of goodness will soon follow, from May 16, 2023, to May 25, 2024. Often we have to give up something to allow room in our life for rewards.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the coming year, you may find love if you are single, for Jupiter conjunct the Sun is one of the best aspects you could possibly have to find genuine true love. This would also be a sensational time to have a baby. If you are married, you will grow closer and have more fun together.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">With Jupiter conjunct the Sun, you will get new opportunities that will open your mind to possibilities that never occurred to you previously. There is a strong likelihood that you will travel abroad at least once in the coming months and that your trip will have a strong influence on your outlook—you will be more optimistic and more willing to start a new chapter in your life.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Many new people will fill your life, and you will cultivate some to become new friends in your upcoming personal Emerald Year (as I call it). Many of the people you meet will be successful types who will not only urge you to fulfill a dream but give you good advice and possibly introductions to help you manifest it. If you live to be 96, you will get eight visits of Jupiter in Taurus in your lifetime. The last time you received this blessing, you may have been too young to take full advantage of it. Jupiter brings a cornucopia of rewards. This is a very important year for you, so make the most of it by visualizing what you hope to happen next.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s now look at the new moon May 19 in your sign of Taurus. This is not an eclipse but a normal new moon that will allow you to make plans and create opportunities. This new moon will help you feel more in control, for Jupiter will be in Taurus along with Mercury (news), Uranus (surprise), and the Sun (strength and presence). With such heavy hitters lined up in your sign, you will be feeling better by the time you get to this new moon, May 19, and beyond. A new moon will carry you forward for six months but is strongest when it first appears.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We need to look at other planets’ positions and attitudes toward this new moon, and here I see a vastly improved picture. Happily, Mars in Cancer will support this new moon, so family will be ready to help you with just about anything you need. Pluto will be on your side by now, thank goodness, so any grief a domineering person may have given you earlier seems to have calmed down and is ready to do an about-face (helpful instead of hurtful in career matters).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Venus, your ruler, will decide the outcome, and happily, she will be in the good graces of Uranus (adding sparkle and possibilities for love) and Mercury (news). Best of all, Venus will be trine Saturn, adding long-range stability. It seems that the May 5 eclipse may rock you, but the effects will be temporary. Having Jupiter in Taurus is the best news EVER—it comes every 12 years! You are now the celestial favorite.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">By month’s end, benefic Jupiter will conjoin the transiting north node in Taurus, a mathematical point that is quite powerful. This will happen on June 1, and is an exceedingly rare aspect that is associated with possibilities for enormous personal growth. The north node points to fulfilling your life’s purpose, so you’ve never had a better forecast to take steps toward your dream than now.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since a series of eclipses moved to Taurus and Scorpio, appearing every six months since November 19, 2021, you’ve been through a number of storms. You did not feel every one of the eclipses in the series because they appeared at different mathematical degrees, but chances are you noticed those that closely touch the degrees of your natal Sun (birthday), birth moon, ascendant, or other natal planets.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A new eclipse in your opposite sign of Scorpio will appear on May 5. I cannot see all the planets in your unique birth chart from where I sit, but I can say if you were born May 1 to May 10, you will see rapid changes in connection with a partner (in love or business) or client, in your domestic situation, or in regard to a family member (specifically, a parent or sibling).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Admittedly, the May 5 full moon lunar eclipse could turn out to be a tense one because what comes up will be quite unexpected, with news coming out of left field. It could cause a major separation with another person or a situation, made either out of choice or one that will be enforced. You won’t have full control for the full moon eclipse will be in your opposite sign of Scorpio, putting more control in the hands of others. All eclipses are non-negotiable, so you can never go back to earlier times—the only option you will have is to move forward. If you don’t like the direction you will choose now (or soon), you can always make changes later on down your path.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time as the eclipse, Pluto will have reached a pinnacle in your chart, as Pluto has recently entered Aquarius, to stay until June 11. (Pluto will return to Aquarius in January and remain 20 years.) This position of such a powerful planet could result in a career offer. If one arrives, take it seriously. If you give the job all you’ve got to give, it could lead you eventually to a very powerful position in your industry.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Your instinct might be to act quickly to fix the situation that comes up, but you would do best to slow down. Mercury has been retrograding in Taurus since April 21 and will not regulate its orbit (go direct) until May 14. Use the first half of the month listening and the second half coming up with options. By June 1 you will be ready to state your thoughts and implement your plans. As a Taurus, you like to carefully consider all facets of a situation before taking action—this time you are right in tune with the universe.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">By the new moon in Taurus May 19 (not an eclipse), the tables will be turned in your favor. You will have far more control than you did earlier, and luck will be on your side. You can voice your concerns and propose remedies, and others will listen. The reason for this new development is that Jupiter, the benefic planet of good fortune and happiness, will have just entered Taurus.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Jupiter visits your sign for a year every 12 years. You had to wait more than a decade for Jupiter to reach this extraordinary place—your own sign. Jupiter will be flanked by the Sun, new moon, Uranus, and Mercury—five heavenly bodies, all in Taurus—adds up to half our solar system weighted in your favor. Mars, from his position in Cancer will send warm greetings to the Sun and new moon—a big plus for making progress on home, property, or family matters that are pending and need to be addressed. It is very possible that the area of your life that brought you stress earlier in the month will show a breakthrough later in May, thanks to the new moon.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Venus is your ruling planet and is taking a leading role at this new moon, May 19. Venus will be given stability by Saturn, suggesting your actions will have gravitas and long-range, lasting power. Use this opportunity to address any changes that have come up earlier, and be your own advocate. With Jupiter in Taurus, you don’t need anyone to help you find your future path—you can discover it by yourself. This new moon will give you a big boost by shattering a previous barrier to your happiness.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Quietly, at month’s end, on June 1, benefic, happiness planet Jupiter will conjoin the north node (a powerful mathematical point) in Taurus, promising a chance to achieve enormous personal growth. It is time to clear the decks and go after that dream you’ve held in your pocket for way too long.</p>
