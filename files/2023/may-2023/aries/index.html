        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">I will say this simply and straightforwardly. May won’t be an easy month. A full moon lunar eclipse in Scorpio, 15 degrees, will arrived on May 5, and this will be an angry one. Everyone of every sign will feel the turbulence, for this eclipse will arrive with the Sun tightly conjunct Uranus in Taurus, planet of unexpected developments, and both will oppose the tender full moon in Scorpio. The Sun and Uranus will be 180 degrees across the sky from the full moon.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Eclipses come in pairs, and the one that occurred earlier on April 19 was in Aries, a new moon solar eclipse, appearing at the very last degree of that sign, in fact within one-half degree of Taurus. It is clear your life is in transition—you have learned a great deal within a certain situation or relationship you had been in until this point, and the universe feels it is now time to move on and learn something new.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Eclipses are always on a mission to find a weak link in your life, one that is toxic, or one that is complete and has run its course. Eclipses are hard to take, because if the eclipse finds something, it will jettison that situation within the blink of an eye. The universe will deem that situation or relationship as complete, and it will not provide you with further insight, productivity, or benefit in the future.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The April 19 solar (new moon) eclipse in Aries arrived tightly conjunct Jupiter, the planet of good fortune and happiness, on one side and the mighty Sun on the other. Jupiter was still in Aries on April 19 protecting you, and new moons are known to bring opportunities. A new moon solar eclipse is a new moon on steroids—very strong, very powerful, and bringing noticeable results.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">This all means that even if the universe is calling on you to give up a situation or relationship so you can progress to your next chapter in life, have faith that this full moon lunar eclipse is bringing you to good place, one of reward for past efforts. The hard part of eclipses is that often they deliver news suddenly and without any warning, and that will be doubly true for the May 5 eclipse, for Uranus will be prominent.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, with an eclipse, news is often triggered that is related to something happening in the outside world that has nothing to do with anything you did or said, but because we are all interrelated, that external situation will come to your doorstep and could temporarily turn one part of your life upside down.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The eclipse that happened on April 19 will help you see yourself in a new light. Often in life you are so busy and engrossed in what you are doing that you fail to see that you are evolving and moving into a new and most likely more mature, better version of “you.” An eclipse will shine a light on you and help you see a new, updated reflection in the mirror. The April 19 eclipse may have made you appreciate the strength and maturity you have gained. That eclipse appeared close to Taurus, so you may be giving up one source of income for another.</p>

        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Now we come to the full moon lunar eclipse on May 5 at 16 degrees Scorpio, and the effect of that full moon may feel a bit belligerent. Because it will fall in your financial eighth house of other people’s money, it may bring up a financial topic outside of salary. It could relate to a commission, royalty, bonus, insurance (health, life, car, or home insurance, for example), severance, child support, or a court settlement, including a divorce settlement.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The news may make you feel something is unfair with the final outcome or that there is an error that has to be corrected. It may be hard to change things, however, as eclipses bring final news with no backtracking or change possible. The only path is forward for they are not negotiable.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There is a separating quality to both the full moon and the new moon later this month—a tearing away quality from a person or situation embedded in the May 5 eclipse and somewhat in the new moon of May 19.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Concerning the May 19 new moon in Taurus, the subject will again be money, but this time things will go better. This is a new moon in your second house of earned income, and you may be negotiating a salary or, if self-employed, an agreement with a new client. The reason things may go MUCH better is that Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, will have arrived just a few days earlier (May 16) in this same financial second house and will be welcomed by Mercury (news, negotiation), Uranus (surprise), and the Sun, so you will have five heavenly bodies, HALF the solar system, in your second financial house. This is the first time in 12 years you will have had Jupiter to help you settle on a generous salary, and you will have this benefic planet here for a year, from May 16, 2023, to May 25, 2024.</p>

        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Mercury will still be retrograde in Taurus, your financial second house, as you enter May, a trend that started April 21, and that will end when Mercury goes direct on May 14. In the first two weeks of May, you may need to untangle certain circumstances that were unclear or reflect an error.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mistakes may have happened regarding your finances—you may never have received a check that you were due. Conversely, you may have written a check to someone who tells you that your payment never arrived in the mail. (Mercury rules the mails and couriers, so this is possible.) Mercury retrograde actually helps in these types of matters, for we are forced to look back and fix matters that were never completed or done properly.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mercury retrograde can be positive, however, if you go back to people you liked to work with and hope to work with again. In that case, Mercury will not give you any frustration. If you are in sales or interviewing for a new job, call clients or former employers you have not heard from in a while—they will be happy to hear from you.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Mars, your ruler, is still in Cancer, and he is putting a lot of emphasis on your home and family until May 20. You may be searching for a new place to live or hoping to sell some property. You may have called in repairmen, painters, your favorite decorator or architect, contractor, or the maintenance crew, or decided to reupholster one or more pieces of furniture.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Your family is being highlighted, too. You may be planning a family reunion, anniversary party for your parents, or a baby shower for your sister. Indeed, family may be top of mind. If you have a child, you may be searching for a new nanny or looking at schools to send your child to later in the year. If you or several members of your family have been squabbling over a matter, you will have a chance to help clear the air and talk things over with the aim to resolve the matter for good. Aim to finish before the end of Mars’ tour in Cancer on May 20.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Once Mars enters Leo, you will have more time for fun and love (Mars will remain in in Leo from May 20 to July 10.) This will usher in a sweet period for you for Leo is a fire sign like yours, and you will be able to absorb the joy that Mars in Leo will bring you quite easily. In Leo, Mars will light your fifth house of love, romance, and happiness, and matters related to pregnancy, birth, and care for children. Mars will also help you express your creativity and flights of imagination. The coming period will be more lighthearted than the past few months have been.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There is an exception, however, when Mars and Pluto will be at loggerheads on May 20. This is an explosive aspect where a play for dominance can surface between two people, and in your case, it would happen in a social setting with friends or a person you are dating seriously. Instead of using this aspect to jockey for power, direct it inward toward creativity. Pluto teaches us the wisdom of transforming from the inside out, so reach inside and open a passageway to allow a plethora of diamonds to spill from your mind. You may come up with an artistic expression that is quite magical.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Last month on April 19, you experienced a solar eclipse in Aries—a strong new moon—one that would usher in deep, positive changes to your life. As you begin this month, you may still be thinking about the events of April and the new chapter that is forming. With eclipses, something ends, and something else begins.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Eclipses come in pairs, and last month’s twin will arrive as a full moon lunar eclipse May 5 in Scorpio, your financial eighth house of other people’s money. This eclipse will contrast with the earlier friendly eclipse. This full moon eclipse will bring sudden, jarring news that may result in a large expense. It might involve taxes, a disappointing court verdict, or a demand for a loan that needs to be paid. These are examples, but almost any kind of financial situation could come up.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow, when money is involved, people have a way of showing their true colors, which can be delusionary and painful to see. Family might be helpful in the situation. This May 5 eclipse might be linked to your home life or family or to events that occurred earlier, near October 10, November 8, or December 7.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that eclipses reveal what is necessary to protect you. Think of an eclipse as a heat-seeking missile, finding situations that are now completed and will no longer yield future possibilities, favor, or insight. They mark a time when we must move forward and say goodbye to something that will now become part of the past.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mercury will be retrograde until May 14, so don’t rush to make conclusions or major decisions as a result of the May 5 eclipse. A lot of cosmic dust will be in the air, so take your time and go slowly. Don’t let anyone push you into a decision—there’s no hurry.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mars, your ruler, is still in Cancer, so your home and family are top of mind. If you have a list of things you need to do regarding your home—choosing new furniture, hiring a contractor or landscape artist, or finding a new place to live, as some examples—then work hard to get as many of those items decide upon by May 20. If you need to do something for a family member, such as to find a new babysitter for your wee one or to help a parent find assisted living quarters, you can also find options during the first (nearly) three weeks of May. After May 20, Mars will move to Leo, a happy place for your ruler to be, for you will then have greater chances for romance and fun, from May 20 to July 10.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The new moon of May 19 will bring more financial news, but unlike the May 5 eclipse, this new moon (not an eclipse) will offer opportunities to make money, perhaps by getting a raise in your present firm or possibly as a loan or gift from family.</p>
