        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">You have one of the happiest charts of the entire zodiac, and that is a dramatic statement considering that we have a difficult eclipse at the start of the month. Keep faith that May will turn out to your liking, even if you find the news of the eclipse in the first week of May painful or disillusioning. The best of the month will arrive in the second half, and I will show you why that is and how to best prepare for the eclipse.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The May 5 full moon lunar eclipse at 15 degrees will fall in Scorpio, your eleventh house of friendship. Lunar eclipses have the strength of three full moons rolled into one, so this could be an emotional moment. A friend will be your focus, and because an eclipse can “eclipse out” someone from our lives, it might be that your friend will move to another part of the country or simply have a lifestyle change, such as to get married, and if you are single (as an example), you may sense you both won’t have the closeness you once enjoyed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I tend to feel, however, that this eclipse may have a stronger influence than what I just described. Uranus, the planet of all things unexpected and that is known to bring news out of the blue, will conjoin the Sun and directly oppose the tender full moon. Whatever happens could prove to be quite shocking. The Sun will be made unstable by Uranus due to its orbit in tight alignment, and that may cost you a sum of money, although I am not sure how that would play into this eclipse—perhaps your friend borrowed money from you, and it is clear it will never be paid back.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In another example, if your friend asks you to be in her destination wedding, you may now realize the costs will be much higher than you had estimated and find this troubling because it will be hard for you to afford all the new and unexpected expenses. It may make you wonder why your friend would put you in this position. Trying to guess what Uranus will bring is always a lost cause—the very nature of Uranus is to bring shock and complete surprise. Uranus teaches the value in being resourceful and to have the ability to think on your feet. There will be a tearing away or separating quality to this eclipse, which leads me to believe you might suffer a betrayal from a friend.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">If you are married, with the moon under siege, your marriage partner will not be much help and could even make the problem worse. Still, your partner clearly wants to help but seems to be socially inept when it comes to untangling the intricacies of a close friendship.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Eclipsed new and full moons are very different from normal lunations. They are stronger, and their job is to change timetables from “someday” to “now” and to dramatically move you into the future. Your perception of time will change under an eclipse—everything will be moving much faster during eclipse week than at other, more normal times. If news of an eclipse upsets you, save your dignity and don’t try to bring things back to the way they used to be before this all happened. With eclipses, your only option is to move forward and to firmly lock the door on the past.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a good rule to remember about eclipses: It is never wise to INITIATE a plan on or near an eclipse, but if you didn’t make the decision, announcement, or initiation, you can RESPOND. Having said that, don’t respond too quickly. All eclipses have a second act, and you will get more information in a matter of days or a few weeks at the most, one reason not to make a decision immediately.</p>

        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">There is another reason to take your time—Mercury is still retrograde, a holdover from last month when Mercury started its backslide on April 21 and will go direct on May 14. Mercury will be retrograde in Taurus, a sign that blends beautifully with yours, but even so, Mercury is in one of your social houses (fifth house), so it’s best to wait for all facts to unfold and be seen in daylight. If you delay your response, you will have time to think, which is always important at eclipse time.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s turn to the most exciting news of all.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On May 16 Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, will reach Taurus, and since Taurus is an earth sign like yours, you will absorb Jupiter’s goodness easily and naturally. Jupiter will fill your fifth house of true love from this month, starting May 16, and remain for an entire year, until May 25, 2024. If you have no special someone, you will have the very best chance to meet an intriguing love interest in the coming months for Jupiter will bring you the possibility of finding genuine love. It is now very possible you will find the person who is right for you and with whom you can eventually build a life together.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">If you are already wed, you will have a chance to have more fun and possibly travel overseas together. Jupiter will encourage you to push back the borders of your life to open your view to one that is far more panoramic. If you both have been working hard but not having much fun together, then that will all change for the better now.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you hope for a baby, the ancient astrologers spoke a great deal about the fifth house being the place of pregnancy, birth, and the joy of caring for children. If you want to conceive, this would be your best year in 12 years to do so. Don’t put this off! (In early March, Saturn left your income sector after being there for three years—your income is due for an uptick soon, possibly in August. Babies bring luck, so don’t worry too much about having enough money. These aspects are so special!)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you have had problem with conception, see a fertility doctor. If you are a young woman in your twenties or early thirties, consider freezing your eggs. This will allow you more time to find the one person who is right for you. The younger your eggs, the better your chances of having a child if you want one sometime in the future. You may not be sure now if you want a child or not, but this will give you the option if you decide yes, you do. The procedure does not hurt as you are put to sleep—and your parents may be glad to help you pay for the procedure (because they want a grandchild).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you already have children, Jupiter will protect them during these coming 12 months. You will have more quality time with your children and can plan some family vacations that will help you weave a memory that will last forever. A few years ago, my two grown daughters, Chrissie and Diana, who each have a young child of their own, came up with the idea that we should plan one week away—together. It was the best idea!</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">If you are in a divorce and worried about child custody, I feel you are likely to get the shared custody you want. As said, your children are supremely protected this year. If you have a child who needs special lessons to bring out a talent or to help with a special need, you are likely, one way or another, to get done everything you need for that child.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The other bonus you will receive from Jupiter is to deepen your creativity and expand your imagination. You can come up with some of your best ideas now and in the coming months, when you’ll be able to showcase your artistic expressions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The way astrology works is that you must partner with the universe. You must show you want these gifts that I outlined to enjoy a richer emotional life. You must believe you can realize the dream that you hold in your heart. For example, if you want love in your life, you will need to step out and circulate. When you do, the universe will meet you more than half way and help you achieve your dream.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In order to get Jupiter to unlock his treasure chest for you and provide emotional warmth, fun, and expansive creativity, you need a new moon in the same sign as Jupiter (that would be Taurus) and in the house ruling all these gifts of love and fun.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You would only get that new moon once a year, and lo and behold, you have that this month on May 19 with the new moon in Taurus at 28 degrees.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">If you could see your horoscope this month, you have HALF the solar system all crowded into your fifth house of true love. You have the mighty Sun (giver of life), the new moon (opportunity), Mercury (news and travel), Uranus (surprises and spontaneity), and Jupiter (happiness and good fortune). What more could you ask? All these heavenly bodies will work hard to bring love, romance, joy with children, and a chance to display your imagination and talents to the world through your ingenuity. A new moon is strong for six months, but doubly strong in the days that follows its appearance. Make note of that timing!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The moon of May 19 will be a critical turning point for you, for you will be given a key to unlock the huge, heavy, creaky doors to reveal new life—quite a wonderland awaits, filled with the possibly of finding true love. Are you excited yet, dear Capricorn? I am, for you!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Your private, social life regarding one close friend will need attention in May due to a challenging full moon lunar eclipse on May 5 in Scorpio. A friend may be moving away, getting married, or making other lifestyle changes that will make it harder for you both to be as close as you used to be. This sometimes happens in the natural attrition of friendship, but because this will happen on an emotional full moon lunar eclipse, the change in your friendship seems not to be something routine but, rather, a reason that will affect you deeply.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is alternatively possible that your friend will betray you in some way, and once you discover the truth about your friendship, you will likely “eclipse out”—leave—a friend from your life.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">The area of the chart that will be so accented by the eclipse on May 5 also rules your work in groups, so if you are a member or officer in a club or charity, you may have some political difficulty with a fellow member who is one of the leaders, perhaps on the board of the group. The choice of what to do will be up to you. If you don’t feel your effort has been appreciated, you may leave.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mercury will be retrograde until May 14, clouding the information coming to you, so be careful about making a snap decision. You will want to act fast, but there is no need—take time to mull over what you’ve learned. You will get more information as the month moves closer to the end. If you value the friendship, you may be able to find a way to salvage it, now or later.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The new moon of May 19 will mark the beginning of a new chapter in your love life. If you are single and not dating anyone, you may now meet someone special. New moons almost always bring in opportunities, so make it a point to step out. You will have the new moon (fresh starts), the Sun (confidence), Uranus (surprise), Mercury (news), and Jupiter (luck) all crowded into the same house of true love—that’s half the number of heavenly bodies in our solar system! This is the best chance you’ve had in over a decade to find your one truelove.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, will enter your fifth house of true love on May 16 and stay 12 months, until May 25, 2024. You’ve not had this kind of cosmic help in matters of the heart since June 2011 to June 2012, 12 years ago, so be sure to mix and mingle as much as possible.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">If you hope for a baby, you may now conceive and bring unimaginable joy—Jupiter is known to bring a cornucopia of happiness when in this house and is even known to bring a miracle. If you have had problem with conception, consult a fertility doctor—you may get a breakthrough.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Are you not interested in having a child? You can direct this precious energy of the new moon into your creative efforts and create a blockbuster this year. The fifth house is the repository of your most beautiful artistic expressions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you are attached, you have Venus moving in your committed relationship sector almost all month, from May 7 to June 5, and this area of your chart rules marriage. This would be a wonderful time to turn away from cares and give your spouse your undivided attention—a vacation together would be a perfect idea. Aim to have fun together. Flirt with your mate the way you did when you first met—your partner’s response will likely be just as you hoped—perfect! Your passion will be matched to your partner’s passion, and that’s a wonderful thought to look forward to in the coming year.</p>
