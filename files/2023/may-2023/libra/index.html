        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Money has been on your mind, or more precisely, the need to bring in more cash to support your lifestyle. Worldwide inflation has played a large part in your frustration along with wage freezes and massive layoffs, so with companies tightening their belts, it has become hard to find a new job. You may also feel an urgency to make more money to care for others in your family. No matter why you’re focused on financials, your timing is good. You might initially doubt me as you enter the month—we have a tough eclipse on May 5—but you will see your financial luck improve in a big way as you get later into May.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The full moon lunar eclipse on May 5 in Scorpio, 15 degrees, will not be anyone’s favorite. Everyone of every sign will feel this eclipse to a certain extent, but each sign will be affected in different ways. The May 5 eclipse will fall in your second house of personal earned income and savings, and it appears there will be no way to avoid paying the piper the amount you owe. Full moons bring things to conclusion. This eclipse is tied in theme to the last lunar eclipse that appeared on November 8, 2022, which was also quite a handful.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Should it turn out that you feel your checking account is currently being vacuum cleaned of almost all your money, keep your spirits up—continue reading, and I will show you why. You have fabulous news coming later this month about your financial status that is remarkable. I have a lot to unpack for you here. The explanation and forecast of what I have for you should speak directly to what is on your mind as you enter May.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There is a reason this eclipse on May 5 will be tension producing. Rebellious, chaotic, and unpredictable Uranus will be tightly conjunct the Sun in Taurus, and both will oppose the tender moon in Scorpio. The full moon lunar eclipse will be IN your financial second house, but as a Libra, the moon rules your prestigious career tenth house, so there may be changes at the office—all that happens this month as a result of the May 5 eclipse regarding your money or career will be unexpected. You may say things come out of left field, with no warning. (Everyone of every sign is in the same boat, dear Libra.)</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Mars will be the one planet to help you through this situation. The action planet is currently in Cancer, lighting your prestigious tenth house of professional achievement. If you have been seeking a job, you will have no trouble getting into the offices of the influential VIPs you need to see. Mars in Cancer will also be helpful to the full moon in Scorpio, and because Mars is one of Scorpio’s rulers, this is a hopeful sign that when things fully play out, they will resolve to your satisfaction. Be confident that the measures you take can and will bring you an excellent conclusion.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Do your best to not announce a big decision near the May 5 eclipse. Mercury in Taurus will be drawn into the fray along with the turbulent effects of Uranus, which may make you feel like you accidently put your finger in an electrical socket. When an eclipse arrives, it always has a second act, so wait until more information is forthcoming in a few days before you proceed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Also, Mercury will be retrograde during the first two weeks of May, having started its retrograde on April 21. Mercury will turn direct on May 14, another reason you should take your time to mull over your response. Don’t rush to act the minute Mercury goes direct on May 14—leave a space of several days before you resume normal activity.</p>

        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">The rule of an eclipse is that it is better to RESPOND but not to INITIATE. You might want to review an essay I wrote about the nature of eclipses. It’s on my app called “Astrology Zone Horoscopes.” You would need the premium subscriber edition ($4.99 a month, or about one dollar a week) found on the Apple App store or Google Play. In the app, go to Menu, then to Life, Love &amp; More, and then to Susan’s Essays. You will see my article that other readers have found helpful, “How to Deal with Eclipses.” I numbered every idea—each is a different piece of advice. My essay is also on my website, so you can just click <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/all-about-eclipses-a-guide-for-coping-with-them/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.astrologyzone.com/all-about-eclipses-a-guide-for-coping-with-them/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1683126702497000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2DVX70jrvdBA8-qxCD2AdO">here</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><u> </u></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s look at the new moon in Taurus, 28 degrees, on May 19. This is the excellent news I mentioned at the start of this report. This new moon will appear in your eighth house of other people’s money (a different financial house in the horoscope) and will be chock full of happy planets. At this point in the month, you will have the Sun, the new moon, Mercury, Uranus, and Jupiter in your eighth house. That is a lot of wonderful energy! Five heavenly bodies add up to half of our solar system.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you are starting a new job, you might want to work on commission, royalties, bonuses, or any basis that is tied to your performance. You may be able to negotiate this at your present position, or you might find a side job to do on weekends. For your side hustle, you may be able to work at home remotely. Your eighth house deals with money that comes to you outside of regular, flat salary and personal savings. Moving forward, this financial house will be the very best area of your chart thanks to the arrival of good-fortune Jupiter on May 16 set to stay for a full year, until May 25, 2024.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">You may also see income from other sources. If you are involved in a court proceeding, you are likely to receive a very generous settlement. If you are going through a divorce, you should be happy with the final division of property and feel it is fair. In another instance, you may get back child support, or you may learn you will receive a large tax refund this year. If you put in a claim to an insurance company, you could collect a generous payout check—if you don’t like the amount at first, keep appealing. You might secure a scholarship for college or discover that the company you work for offers a tuition-match program to help employees earn an advanced degree. You may find a government program that addresses a certain need, too.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Saturn and Jupiter are moving toward a sextile (a lovely aspect that is 60 degrees apart, denoting opportunity) to make a perfect hit on June 19. By the time the new moon appears on May 19, these two slow-moving planets will already be within an orb of significance. Saturn rules your family and property, so you may receive money from your family if you need a loan or gift to cover your expenses.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You will be lucky with banks regarding loans and mortgages, but interest rates are high now, so you may want to find other sources of money. You might also win a raffle or contest where there’s a valuable prize, or you could receive an inheritance from a long-lost relative who remembered you in their will. No doubt about it, in the coming 12 months, you will be luckier than a leprechaun when it comes to money.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The eighth house is also the house of transformation, so surgical procedures are included here, for when the surgeon removes the part of you that has been hurting, he or she brings you to sturdy health again. You have excellent aspects to check into a hospital to schedule a procedure you have put off but need. Jupiter’s presence suggests you would be able to find a distinguished doctor who is a leader in his or her field. If you have the procedure, do it after Mercury turns direct (May 14) if you can select the date. If it’s an emergency, have the surgery, and don’t worry about any of this. Jupiter is also called the great healer and will help you recover no matter when you have your operation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As I have mentioned, you will be fortunate with insurance too, so it looks like your health insurance would cover many, if not all, of the costs of your surgery or other procedures thanks to Jupiter’s new position in Taurus. Check with your insurance company well ahead of your appointment just to be sure. Dental work also falls under surgery, and if you have dental insurance, it might prove to be an excellent policy.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The month starts out with a major full moon lunar eclipse in Scorpio on May 5, which will have you powerfully focused on your own earned income and savings.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A little later in the month, you will also be thinking about the money you share with another individual or institution, such as with your spouse, bank, credit card company, student loan provider, or government for taxes owed. This May 5 eclipse is not a friendly one, and just about everyone of every sign will be dealing with unexpected, sudden news. For you, the news will be about money, and it appears the demand or need for payment will come up within five days of May 5. Alternatively, you may be helping a family member who is in a jam.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you are in the process of a court case or working on a divorce settlement, you may not like the settlement offer initially if it arrives at the eclipse on May 5. Hopefully, you can delay talks about the division of property until later in the month, for doing so will help. You need to wait until Jupiter moves into Taurus, your eighth house of other people’s money, on May 16 to stay for a full year, until May 25, 2024.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Here is the problem with the full moon lunar eclipse in Scorpio on May 5. Unpredictable, rebellious Uranus will conjoin the Sun and directly oppose the full moon eclipse. This is the strongest eclipse of the year, and when the message of the eclipse arrives, it will send news that will appear to come out of the blue without warning. How well you will do depends on what you’ve been discussing (involving money) up until this point, starting last month or even earlier.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, trying to guess what will come up at this eclipse on May 5 will be futile for the very nature of Uranus is to plot a surprise, and none of us will like it. Uranus is trying to teach you and me (and all of us) resourcefulness and agility under pressure.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you are interviewing for a job near May 5 and you were the selected candidate, you might be discussing your future salary. This full moon will either bring you to an agreement (if the offer pleases you) or not. If you don’t like it, you may walk away. If you are self-employed, this may involve a new project or client. You will be able to choose what you do. This chaotic full moon will bring you closure, and after the eclipse delivers its news, you can planor strategize accordingly.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that you can never go back to how things were before the eclipse appeared for eclipses are on a mission to push you forward, not back to former times. If you don’t like what is happening at eclipse time, you can always change things around several months from now.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mars is in your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement, helping you elevate your reputation and take on new duties that will give you more power and influence. You can do this by receiving a promotion, accepting a new position at another company, or by bringing in a prestigious new client if you are self-employed. This is a great placement for Mars for you will easily attract the attention of VIPs who have the authority to hire, and you can make an excellent impression in your interview.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">If you are not involved with a career matter, the fact that Uranus is conjunct the Sun suggests you might be thinking about a friend who, much to your shock, has not been as loyal to you as you assumed she was. Suddenly, your friend may be showing you a troubling side, making you feel disillusioned for having placed your trust in her. (Lunar eclipses tend to point to females—the reason I refer to your friend as a “she.”) This eclipse is related to the one that occurred on November 8, plus or minus one month, so if you follow the breadcrumbs, you will find money is at the core of the problem.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mercury started to retrograde last month on April 21 and will continue to retrograde until May 14. Leave a space of as many days as possible before you start making commitments or announcements to allow Mercury to regulate its speed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The new moon on May 19 in Taurus will give you a chance to reverse the tension and make great money. Indeed, after this new moon appears, financial news could go from dark to bright. It won’t be easy to do—you will have to present a well-organized, persuasive case for VIPs to approve your suggestions, but you can be victorious. Mars will oppose Pluto on May 20, so you will get some strong pushback from a crusty VIP initially, but with Mars in a supportive angle to the Sun and new moon from your prestigious tenth house of professional recognition, you can persuade others to come to your side.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Venus rules Taurus and is being friendly to Uranus, indicating a non-traditional, innovative solution will be the path to rallying an agreement. As you come to the new moon on May 19, you can capture the job or client you want by displaying out-of-the-box creative thinking, for that’s what VIPs will be looking to see from you.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The most important element regarding this new moon is the arrival of Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, to Taurus, your eighth house of other people’s money, for the first time since the year spanning June 2011 to June 2012. You will go from stressing out about money to having plenty of chances to make considerable cash. Banks will work with you to offer a loan or mortgage, and if you need venture capital, investors will take you seriously. Working on commission, royalties, licensing fees, or bonuses will be your best way to increase your income. In other words, performance-based compensation should work in your favor.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">If you are in a court case for a divorce, it would be much better to make a final agreement for the division of property, for child support, or other matters involving finances in June or even later, such as July.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Once Jupiter is in place to help you (in Taurus as of May 16, to continue for a year), yourlife will gradually improve in noticeable ways. Jupiter will help deliver you a fair—and even generous—settlement. Also possible in the coming 12 months: You may be given an inheritance, scholarship, valuable gift, court settlement, or other positive financial news. It is clear you will need a lawyer to protect your interests, but you can come out sunny-side up if you are an active participant in your legal proceedings.</p>
