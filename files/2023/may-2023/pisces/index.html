        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">The start of the month is a bit wild and wooly due to a difficult full moon lunar eclipse in Scorpio, 15 degrees, on May 5. As a Pisces, you seem to be one of the fortunate signs, so perhaps you will be standing on the sidelines, watching all that is going on with others and helping where you can. I’m not sure you will be directly affected by this particular eclipse—Scorpio blends well with your sign, so you will have that in your favor. It also is falling in a cadent house, which means it is a milder part of the chart than some of the other houses.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Here is what I see. A full moon lunar eclipse will bring a matter to conclusion. This eclipse will fall in your ninth house, which rules international relationships, distant travel, matters of immigration, residence, passport, citizenship, and travel visas. It also rules the media in terms of publishing, broadcasting, and projects (as producer or writer or as the subject of the story).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This area of your chart also rules legal matters and the court system, as well as matters related to pursuing a college, graduate school, or other degree. All full moons are more emotional than new moons, and a lunar eclipse is more emotional still. Something ends and something else begins.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This eclipse on May 5 appears to be testing your ability to remain practical, realistic, calm, resourceful, and imaginative when things start not to go according to plan. You appear to be ready to make a final decision or finally finish up a creative project related to one of the topics listed above.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Here is what concerns me. Transiting Uranus in Taurus will be tightly conjunct the Sun, and both will tightly oppose and challenge the tender full moon in Scorpio. When Uranus is involved, there’s always completely unexpected news that seems to come out of left field. It would be something you would not consider—something outside your view.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Uranus will also orbit close to Mercury in Taurus. Mercury will pick up on the unstable waves and static being emitted by Uranus. This likely means you will be keeping your eye on your physical home (if you have a home-related plan on your agenda) or thinking about a member of your immediate family, even if you have no reason to worry.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, Pluto will also be demanding and will be in conflict with Jupiter. These are both slow-moving planets and will be within orb of each other all month, meaning we don’t have to be at their pinpointed aspect due May 17 (a 90-degree square, indicating obstacles). As a result, I feel a financial matter you are dealing with may have to be restructured, tweaked, or renegotiated under this vibe sometime this month.</p>

        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">If you are to feel Pluto, it likely would be personified as demanding, self-absorbed VIP who has authority and uses his power to pressure you. This is found in your twelfth house of secrets, so he may not have been fully transparent with you. I do not want you to become overly suspicious, just keep your antenna up and watch what a people do, not what they say.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We have to watch what the Sun and moon will be doing too, for they rule different parts of your chart, and they will be feeling the direct challenge from Uranus. The Sun rules your sixth house, covering all work-a-day assignments, subordinate workers who report to you at the office (such as your assistant) or at home (such as your nanny or housekeeper), your physical office headquarters, equipment, and the software you use to get your job done. The matter on the table is most likely related to a project that is reaching culmination or to a person who may need to depart.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The sixth house also rules small domestic pets, so keep an eye on your little dog or cat to make sure he stays healthy. If he starts acting odd, bring your little creature to a veterinarian quickly.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The moon in Pisces’ chart rules your fifth house, which covers your children and matters related to pregnancy, birth, and care for your children (no matter what their age). The moon also rules your romantic life, leisure, fun, vacations, and parties. With Uranus glaring at the moon, one of these areas could be a topic of conversation and be changing.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">I feel it most likely will be a creative project, or you may need to make a decision about an emotional attachment with a romantic partner you are dating. (If you are wed, this eclipse will not likely affect you since the relationship with your spouse and your marriage are ruled by another part of the chart.)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is rare to see an eclipse bring in so many areas of life at once.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I suggest you keep your schedule light, and don’t travel over the eclipse. You will want to be home in case you have to drop what you are doing and turn you attention to whatever has come up. You may be tempted to rush, but instead, slow down and resist that urge—all eclipses have a second act, and you will be receiving more information within days or approximately two weeks.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The universe is speaking in riddles as Mars will be very helpful, and this is good news for Mars rules Scorpio, the sign of the eclipse. This suggests that you can get things the way you want them to be in the final result of the matter. It will take effort, but stay optimistic. Every eclipse is on a mission to find and expose weak links, so when the universe shows you what it finds, you may be disappointed, sad, or shocked, but eclipses deal in truth, so be grateful for that.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This May 5 eclipse in Scorpio is tied in theme to the full moon lunar eclipse of November 8 last year. When you look back at your calendar, check for events that occurred October 10 and December 7, too. Astrologers work with bell curves, so you could feel an eclipse before it actually happens (this will be true for 10 percent of readers) or conversely, one month to the day after it occurs (15 percent of readers). Most eclipses deliver their news within five days of the date they fall (75 percent). Allow a plus or minus five days in all cases. Consider always reading your forecast for your rising sign as well as your Sun sign to get a 360-degree view of what is to come.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">You are a mutable sign, which means you are one of the four signs (specifically Gemini, Sagittarius, Virgo, and Pisces) known to be the most flexible, versatile, and adaptable. This effortless quality in you will come in handy now.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s now turn to very happy news of the month—the move of Jupiter to Taurus on May 16, to stay a full year, until May 25, 2024. Jupiter is set to light your third house of communication and will put an enormous emphasis on writing, speaking, editing, translation, code writing, public speaking, software and code creation, and other elements of communication. This will be your area of greatest personal growth and gratification and possibly produce a lucrative income.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You may be involved in creating a podcast series or app, software, a basic education course you would give online or in person, an advertising campaign, a public relations or social media effort, a marketing strategy, or digital games You may be working on a book or a documentary film or writing a screenplay. You might be redoing your website, delving into NFTs and Web 3 or other digital forms. You get the idea.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Jupiter is in your third house and will make this area, that of communications, the most glowing, and productive area of your chart. I should add that from now on, you will be traveling more too, but not necessarily to distant destinations. With Jupiter being helpful, you may want to buy a new car, and as long as Mercury is not retrograde (like it is now until May 14) you will love your new car. (I have a list of Mercury retrograde dates on the homepage of AstrologyZone.com and also in the premium version of my app, Astrology Zone Horoscopes.)</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">To open Jupiter’s treasure chest, you would need a new moon to appear in the same sign, Taurus. That only happens once a year, but wow, that’s exactly what you will have just three days after Jupiter arrives on May 16 for his full year’s stay.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">What a wonderful new moon this will be, May 19, because you will have the new moon, Sun, Jupiter, Mercury, and Uranus, ALL in Taurus, all crowded into one tiny sliver of your solar chart, the one ruling communications and travel. Opportunity should tumble forth almost immediately, within a day or two of the new moon, and keep going for weeks. A new moon is active for six months.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The emphasis on communication has been strong for a long time for you and has led to this point, so it looks like your ship is about to come in, dear Pisces. The universe is listening, and the world is eager for you, so you have to say—go for the gold!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A person who is important to you—likely based at a great distance or even overseas—will be on your mind in early May. A full moon lunar eclipse will arrive on May 5 and could culminate an agreement and a flurry of activities. You may need to travel to see this person, or you may be connecting over Zoom or email. The project being discussed seems to involve communication—writing, speaking, editing, computer coding, doing research, or the publishing/broadcasting of information. Alternatively, you may be working on social media or an advertising campaign or creating a game, or you could be interviewed by the press. You also may be given a contract to sign.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that Mercury will be retrograde, a holdover from last month, which started April 21, and will end May 14. It is not wise to make a written or verbal agreement during Mercury retrograde, so study what is being offered, and delay the signing until near May 26, giving a space of days after the official end of the retrograde to allow cosmic storms to fully pass through. If you sign at any point this month, you would be building into the DNA of the contract some of the unstable, unpredictable aspects at play. Also, do not buy electronics now—Mercury rules electronics as well as the gears and all moving parts in machines—so you may not enjoy your purchase as you anticipated if you buy it now.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The new moon of May 19 (not an eclipse) will appear in your third house of communication and bring you opportunities to delve deeply into a wide range of topics that fall under this subject. You may be building a podcast series, designing a new app, or working with a team to redesign your website. You may be starting to write a book or screenplay, or you may get a new position with a magazine or Internet site. Jupiter’s position in Taurus suggests that there is money for you to make.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Take your communications projects seriously—good-fortune Jupiter will have just entered this part of your chart on May 16 for the first time in over a decade. The project you take on will be a jewel in your crown and help you create something of lasting value. When Jupiter is present, there is always considerable money to be made along with a large boost to your reputation. Jupiter will remain in your third house of communication and short distance travel for a full year, until May 25, 2024.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">With such a strong emphasis on travel, you may be tempted to hop a plane to take a trip for business or pleasure. With Mars and Venus both in your most romantic sector, you would best go for a romantic getaway in the second half of May. Both Venus and Mars, called the astrological cosmic lovers, will be flying through Cancer, your fifth sector of true love. If single, this would be a great time to take a holiday at a beach setting, as Cancer is a water sign. You could strike up a conversation with someone new and interesting. If attached, you might want to bring your family (or visit family) and weave a tapestry of an experience in golden threads that will remain in your family’s memory for a lifetime.</p>
