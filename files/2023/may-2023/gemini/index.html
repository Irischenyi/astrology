        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">This month starts out with a difficult full moon—actually a full moon lunar eclipse—in Scorpio, 15 degrees, on May 5. This is not a time to take any risks or proceed with any major launches or initiations in your personal or work life. It would be best not to travel this month. Plan to stay at home at least for the first two weeks of May for you may have to direct others on how to help solve a situation, and that’s always easier if you are home.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You have a strong buildup of planets in your twelfth house of secrets, so it appears either you, or someone near you, is acting on a plan that will affect you, but he or she is keeping things under wraps. To say this more clearly, someone might not be working to your benefit, so keep your antenna up. You will have an extraordinary gift of intuition now and in the months to come, and this will come in handy and be quite correct.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This full moon lunar eclipse will occur in your sixth house of work-a-day assignments and will include workers who report to you at home and at work (such as a nanny, housekeeper, or your assistant, for example). Something is about to reach a crest. Uranus, a planet that covers all things unexpected, in Taurus will be tightly conjunct the Sun and Mercury, and all will directly oppose the full moon in Scorpio. This means news will come out of the blue, and this news would be the last thing you would ever expect to hear—it is a nerve-jangling time. Your ruler Mercury is involved prominently in this eclipse, which spells greater tension. Your home or one of your family members might be in a jam, and you may need to help.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile Pluto is newly minted in Aquarius, your ninth house, and will apply pressure to Mercury in Taurus (in a wide but significantly harsh 90-degree square), giving you another reason to delay any travel in May. The ninth house rules the court system too, so if you need legal advice at this time, the situation may be a tangled quagmire and not easy to sort out. Have patience. (Pluto is due to leave next month on June 11 when he retreats back to Capricorn to tie up loose ends. Pluto will return to Aquarius to stay permanently—20 years—next January.)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Eclipses are legendary for bringing all kinds of buried information to light, and on May 5, you may find out what’s going on under the surface quite suddenly. As said, this full moon has Uranus, the planet of unpredictable, surprise events that you’d never imagine happening, conjunct the Sun. Both are in severe opposition to the full moon. The full moon is found IN your work-a-day project sector, but the moon RULES your finances. I feel you may receive a sudden expense, which could be considerable (I hope I am wrong). Keep an eye on your projects and assignments because something might go off the rails at the last minute, just as you’re wrapping up the project.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, because the sixth house (where this eclipse will occur) is where subordinates are found, you may hear that a trusted worker is leaving, such as your assistant (at work), a nanny, your mother’s daily caretaker, your housekeeper, bookkeeper, gardener, or another person who you hired and would see daily or frequently at home or at work. A great assistant is hard to find, so this news may shock and sadden you, but have faith—you will be able to handle this news and find a replacement who you like just as much.</p>

        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">The sector where this lunar eclipse will appear also rules health, so keep an eye on how you treat your body. If you feel anything that seems off, have it checked out. Be careful not to take any medicine or potentially harmful herbs or other consumables this month. Ask about possible side effects before you take any new prescriptions. With many heavenly bodies gathering in your twelfth house, you may interact with medical personnel.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You might go in for a surgical procedure you have been putting off, whether that be medical or dental in nature. Alternatively, you might decide to schedule a round of routine tests that you know you should do each year. Or the medical discussions might not be centered on you should you decide to act as an advocate and helper to a family member in the hospital.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mercury, your ruler, will continue to retrograde until May 14, so if you do need surgery, see if you can schedule it for later in the month (if the procedure is elective and not urgent). We cannot control everything in life, so if you need surgery, by all means have it as soon as you can. While Mercury retrogrades, it is also important to put off signing papers until later in May. Don’t buy a car or any electronic item (or machine) while Mercury is out of phase. Any planet is at its worst behavior within the days just before and after retrograde—the start and end dates—so you always want to leave several days in between. Mercury goes direct May 14, so wait a few more days before doing any of the above.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I will admit we all will be rattled by the May 5 eclipse. It has a gang of unhappy, squabbling planets, and their disagreements with each other will create tremors we will all notice here on Earth. The rule with eclipses is never to initiate an action, only respond to someone else’s initiation or challenge. If you do that, you will have a better shot at a favorable outcome.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">The theme of this eclipse is tied to the one that occurred on November 8 (although you might have felt jarring news on October 10 or December 7, 2022).</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Although this May 5 full moon lunar eclipse will be problematic to almost all of us, I have great news.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, will enter Taurus on May 16, your twelfth house of secrets, confinement (hospitals, rehab, physical therapy, and the like), and all work done behind closed doors. If you do have interactions with medical personnel, you have Jupiter protecting you in this house. The twelfth house is also associated with the workings of the subconscious mind.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Eleven days after the eclipse Jupiter will arrive in Taurus and is set to stay from May 16, 2023, to May 25, 2024—an entire year.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s look at the new moon on May 19 in Taurus, arriving just three days after Jupiter moves into Taurus. This new moon (not an eclipse) will set a trend when you will want to withdraw and take some private time. If you have to do research for a book you are writing, for scientific research for a medicine you are developing, or while drawing up your opening statements in a court case if you are a lawyer, as some examples, you are in luck. Your very best work will happen when you are alone in a place where you can think in solitude after May 19. Your intuition will run quite deep from this point on, so you would be wise to listen to your hunches. In fact, you may have a prophetic dream—pay attention to it. Jupiter will work closely with Saturn to bolster your reputation and cement your outlook for your future career growth. Your reputation seems unscathed despite a problem you might have concerning one particular project near May 5.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, when you have Jupiter behind the scenes in your twelfth house (as you will for a year, starting May 16), you will be protected in hospitals and places of confinement and would likely work with distinguished doctors and other medical personnel.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Jupiter in Taurus has another bonus for you—your higher-ups speak of you in glowing terms to each other, something you might not be aware of for some time. VIPs will look out for you and be willing to see you receive the kinds of assignments you deserve so that you can grow within the organization. The new moon on May 19 will trigger this bonus for you.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">When Jupiter is finished with his tour of Taurus next year on May 25, 2024, he will move into Gemini and give you one of the finest years of your life. You will enter your Emerald Year, so this year, before you reach that point, is a good time to plan for what you hope to achieve when you have your glorious year of opportunity, happiness, and luck on all fronts. You have not had a year like this for over a decade, so it will be special. Indeed, if you live to 96, you will have eight of these shimmering years in your lifetime.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">For now, you are entering 12 months of preparation for your Emerald Year. Start to think about what you hope to achieve. The more detailed you can be, the more likely you will experience the best year of your life.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At the full moon lunar eclipse on May 5, a work project will require a great deal of concentration, so you will need to keep an eye on it. The bus carrying this project could have its wheels fall off and roll in every direction at the full moon lunar eclipse in Scorpio on May 5, plus or minus five days. It will be up to you to decide whether it’s worth fixing. The situation will come to a culmination or crisis in a sudden or unexpected way. Forces behind the scenes have not been easy to spot, for one or more people have not been fully transparent with you. When this news is fully revealed, it may shock you.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">People tend to reveal their true character at eclipse time. It’s not a good situation, but Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, is eyeing all that is going on. He will contact Saturn, which is positioned in your career sector, and together, in an effort to add stability to a potentially stormy career situation, they can do much to save the day. Jupiter, a planet often referred to as the planet of miracles, can be effective—it all depends on how you feel about the emerging situation and how you decide to handle it.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">This full moon on May 5 is given triple strength by the fact that it is a lunar eclipse. Saturn, presently in your career and prestigious reputation sector (your tenth house), is the natural ruler of your house of other people’s money, including commissions, bonuses, royalties, licensing fees, loans, mortgages, reimbursed expenses, taxes, and the like. A conflict over a financial matter seems to be a large part of the problem, or you may have a large, necessary expense come up.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t rush to judgment. Your ruler Mercury will be retrograde until May 14, clouding the relevant details of the situation. There is a bigger reason not to act quickly: News that comes to you at eclipse time tends to stir up a lot of cosmic dust, and until the dust settles, it’s hard to choose a path forward. Every eclipse has a second act, and more news will be forthcoming within a short time—a few days or weeks.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">By May 19, the new moon (not an eclipse) will bring five heavenly bodies to your twelfth house of secrets, so be circumspect with your dealings with others. People may not be supporting you in the way you would normally assume they would, and instead, they might be working at cross purposes with you. Pluto will be in a hard angle to Jupiter, so a past agreement or an ongoing project may need to be tweaked, reassessed, renegotiated, or abandoned altogether. This is not a good month to take risks, so proceed with a more cautious, conservative approach through all that happens.</p>




        <h2>Your  Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Mars will remain in Cancer until May 20, so during the first three weeks of May, you will be spending more money than usual, a trend that started March 25. Venus is in Cancer too, your financial salary and savings house, so if you are buying clothes or accessories for the coming season, they will be quite beautiful. On May 26, you might find a gorgeous item on the Internet that you feel you must have when Venus connects to Uranus.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Mars moves into Leo on May 20, to stay until July 10, it will be time to travel more often, and that is sure to be music to your ears. You need not choose a distant point—nearby locations will bring you great pleasure.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You are in a year of preparation for the Emerald Year that is coming, starting May 25, 2024, and extending a full year. You have been waiting 11 years for this sparkling year—when Jupiter will enter Gemini—you have one more year to go. The more you prepare for it, the bigger and better that year will be. You have the time to get ready, so start dreaming with a purpose, and imagine all that is possible.</p>
