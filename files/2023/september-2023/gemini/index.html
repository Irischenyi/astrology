        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>After two months of feeling you were getting nowhere, a change is afoot. Venus will go direct in Leo on September 3. Your ruler Mercury, still retrograde as you start September, will finally go direct on September 15. Things are about to get better and better.</p>
<p>If you have been working on a situation or with a relationship that seemed to go in endless circles—getting nowhere fast—we all feel that way. As a Gemini, you feel Mercury retrograde more than most because Mercury is your ruler. If you have Gemini or Virgo rising (or your natal moon in either of those two signs) and work in publishing or broadcasting, you can triple everything I just said.</p>
<p>Venus going direct September 3 will help your outlook for love and fun. Venus also rules beauty, luxury, and expensive purchases like diamonds and other precious gems, so you will soon see that life has become more social, lighter, and happier. You can call your dermatologist for treatments, the luxury spa for a massage, and your stylist to create a new hairstyle for you, and maybe best of all, if you are single, you can start dating again after Venus goes direct. If you dated during Venus retrograde, your first date would have a tenancy to deflate in affection after the first rush of excitement. Venus rules love after all, and you don’t want a weak Venus when you first meet. The condition of the planets will affect all the entire term of the relationship.</p>
<p>I feel it would be worth waiting 12 more days, until September 15, when Mercury, your ruler, will go direct, too. Venus typically retrogrades for approximately six weeks, and Mercury for three and a half weeks. You are so close now to enjoying an open road of ideal planetary aspects that I feel you should wait until September 15 to initiate important actions.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>My dentist recently informed me that I would have to see the orthodontist, as my teeth were moving. Time to wear braces (Invisalign) he said, a fate I had somehow escaped my entire life. The orthodontist, who I visited for the first time prior to Venus’ retrograde, informed me it would take a year to correct my teeth. I told her I couldn’t start September 18. “Oh!” she said brightly, “Traveling?” Yes, I fibbed, praying she wouldn’t ask me where I was going. I was actually planning to be holed up in my apartment all summer writing my 2024 calendar, but it seemed like travel would be a better, more glamourous excuse to give her.</p>
<p>My orthodontist was OK with that timing, and as I handed her the first of what is to be many checks, she said, musing, I will probably have to wear the retainer for the rest of my life. My teeth will keep moving, just like those of everyone else’s. I had an immediate flash of me in the future, at age 105 (the current age of my spritely great aunt Faye, a Cancer, June 24) walking around New York wearing my retainer. That sealed my decision. There was no way I was going to undergo this expensive, lengthy procedure with Venus or Mercury retrograde. September 18 is my first appointment. I follow my own advice.</p>
<p>Turning to another topic, as you enter September, you may be thinking about your career and your family, and you may be feeling pulled in two directions over the situation which surfaced. On August 30 you experienced a full moon in Pisces, the very pinnacle of your chart (tenth house), bringing to culmination an important professional matter. A full moon has five days of influence as it gradually wanes, so you would feel its effects until September 4.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mars recently moved into Libra on August 27 and will remain in this perfect-for-Gemini placement until October 11. This should enliven your love life in a big way.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>That full moon might have made you feel you were in the spotlight of publicity or praise for the tenth house, where this full moon would occur in your chart, is the lofty house of honors, awards, and achievement. It is the house that reflects the status and prestigious advancement you make in your career. Saturn was conjunct that full moon, adding a serious note of commitment that you would make at this time. There are various ways this could work out.</p>
<p>You may finish a very important project that you worked on long and hard and may hear much applause. Or you may get publicity in the press, but it is a wild card whether you will agree with the reporter’s assessment of you and your work. You might be thrilled or upset—it could go either way. Among mature readers, this full moon of August 30 may have marked your retirement, and for younger readers, it may have marked a major move to a new job. A full moon will always require a quick decision—there will be no time to mull things over—so this last full moon will deliver its news, you will decide, it will be over, and you will move on.</p>
<p>If you are self-employed, you may be given a weighty assignment from a new client, and good money would come with it. Saturn rules a financial sector of your chart, and the moon in Gemini’s chart is tied to your income. Financial discussions and negotiations seem to be triggered by this full moon</p>
<p>Pluto will be activated by the August 30 full moon and will be sending beams from your financial eighth house to that moon, suggesting you may see a large sum of money at the start of the month (if you didn’t already get a large sum last month, you will likely get one no later than September 4.)</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>At the same time (August 30) Jupiter, the good fortune planet, currently in Taurus, will be beaming his blessings to Mercury (in close, tight degree). Mercury is your ruler, which means this supportive aspect will be weighted more heavily in your favor than most other signs. Mercury is in your home sector, so this month many of your efforts to improve home and family will be rewarded, and you will be protected.</p>
<p>I have gone into a lot of detail about the August 30 full moon because it was an important one, and you will soon see how it will play out for you. Post on social media, if you like, on how it worked out for you. I want to know, and say if you are a Gemini or have Gemini rising.</p>
<p>Clearly you will be thinking of your family a lot in September—most likely one person in particular—or about your actual residence or other property you own, rent, or want to buy or sell. It is a persistent theme throughout the month.</p>
<p>When I think about your pressures at work, I feel there are VIPs who don’t want to hear about your responsibilities at home—they want your full, undivided attention (blame Saturn). No doubt you will have a full plate.</p>
<p>Helping home and family appears to be a persistent theme throughout the month, and I feel you will make considerable progress. You may want to move, refurbish, paint, redecorate, or declutter. You might instead want to entertain guests at a party that you give at home or invite a friend or family member over for a few nights to stay in your guest room. The full moon of August 30 can be of enormous help to you to accomplish those type wishes and plans.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>When it comes to career, Neptune is working in your favor, and Neptune is the ruler of your tenth house of career success. This is fortunate. Neptune in your tenth house of career will be in fine angle to Uranus in the behind-the-scenes part of your chart (twelfth house), so you have unexpected help from someone in a position to make right anything that might need to be corrected. Initially, you might not like the news of the full moon August 30 (you might already know about the message of that full moon). But hold on, you have plenty of good aspects to counter news you don’t like and reap the benefits of news and opportunities that you do.</p>
<p>Let me pause here for a second. Earlier, I mentioned “Gemini rising.” This refers to your rising sign, also called your “ascendant.” You know about your Sun sign (the sign where the Sun was on the day you were born), but your rising sign is JUST as important, and the only way to find your rising sign (that is, the sign that was on the eastern horizon at the precise time you were born) is by doing your chart. And you can now do your own chart on my Astrologyzone.com site—for free. Just click on the banner above the fold that says “Free Natal Birth Chart.” This isn’t available on my app, only on my site, and you can do your chart as many times as you’d like.</p>
<p>Returning now to your September forecast, the theme of home and family will come up again, but this time in a wonderful way at the new moon September 14 in Virgo, 22 degrees. This cheerful new moon will herald a fresh start in your home environment, in regard to other property you hope to buy, sell, or rent, or to find good solutions to help a family member.</p>
<p>You have a golden triangle—quite beautiful—linking your Sun conjunct the new moon in Virgo to receiving generous beams from Pluto in your house of other people’s money. (That sector rules such funding as bank loans, venture capital, gifts, inheritances, prize money, insurance payouts, and other windfalls.) This will allow you to move ahead on projects that involve real estate and to help a family member in need, if this is your priority.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>The third point of the golden triangle involves Uranus, planet of surprise, in Taurus at 22 degrees—a tight, perfect aspect to this new moon. Wow—a surprise opportunity or solution will likely come up out of the blue. In astrology we always look to the tightest aspect being sent to the new or full moon, and Uranus is beaming a tighter beam than any other, and thereby will be the planet to have the strongest effect.</p>
<p>This is not to minimize the fact that Saturn will directly oppose Mercury at the September 14 new moon—you seem cognizant that the action you want to take will have a long-range effect and represents a serious move. For example, if you want to buy a house, you may feel ready, aware of the responsibility you are taking on and the payments you will need to make each month plus the cost of the upkeep. This thinking will ensure your success. As I said, you will have so much help from Uranus, planet of surprise.</p>
<p>With Saturn in your tenth house, your work life has a steady drumbeat ever-present in the background—clearly your career needs continual attention. You are expanding your role in your industry, so you’ll have lots to learn and a few new challenges to meet. You will have an older person nearby to help you learn the ropes. Gemini is a quick study—alert, adaptable, versatile—the reason you are tackling a bigger role now. You can handle all that comes your way.</p>
<p>One of your best days of the month to sign papers will be September 25 when Mercury and Jupiter will be in superb communication. This will also be a perfect time to travel. If you have to travel a short distance to attend the event that I see coming up, that will make it all the better, for Venus is in your third house of travel and will shower you with rose petals. This is a Monday, and you will feel this aspect growing over the preceding weekend of September 23-24.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>Now let’s turn to the full moon on September 29. It is a golden peach of a moon in Aries where it will light your house of friendships, and it is likely you will have an exciting event to attend (or you may give the party). Pluto will beam gorgeous rays to the moon, so the people who attend this event will be successful types who will inspire you. Uranus will be beaming sweetly to your ruler Mercury in your home sector, so you may be attending a family event where friends are invited, too.</p>
<p>As an aside, it is always possible that two separate events will come to you at the same time—an event with friends and then separately, good news about a family member or real estate may happen at month’s end and be unrelated to the previous event. I do see you happy at this September 29 full moon. For example, you may be attending a fun convention, and at the same time get good news about your mother’s upturn in health. You see what I mean.</p>
<p>A full moon in Aries on September 29 would put Mars in charge, and happily, Mars in Libra will reach out to his sweetheart Venus in Leo. This is such good news, for it shows how far this full moon will go for you to be sure you have a loving, happy, and warm social life.</p>
<p>Mars recently moved into Libra on August 27 and will remain in this perfect-for-Gemini placement until October 11. This should enliven your love life in a big way. Single, attached, or married, all Gemini have a fresh chance at love. Mars will give you a better life-work balance with more chances for romance in coming weeks.</p>
<p>You will like the changes that September will bring. You’ve trudged through glue long enough—now you have solid help on the way.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Your career and reputation will be on your mind as September opens due to a full moon in Pisces on August 30, which will still be strong and influential in the first four days of September. Saturn, the teacher planet, will tightly orbit with this full moon, suggesting you may have a serious professional commitment, decision, or matter to deal with. It seems to involve money, so you may have to write a sizable check to invest in your own business (perhaps to build a complex app for your business) or in yourself, such as to go back to college or graduate school for additional training. The aim will help you become more competitive in the marketplace—if you want to be in demand, you can make it happen.</p>
<p>Since August 23, you have been hampered by your ruling planet Mercury in retrograde, and that continues as you start the month, so if possible, put off taking action on any important matter until after Mercury goes direct, September 15. In the meantime, ask many questions and do your due diligence. You can also sign a contract after Mercury goes direct—I recommend the finest day of the month for Gemini, September 25, when Mercury will be divinely harmonious to Jupiter, the good fortune planet.</p>
<p>If you feel you will lose the job, the apartment, or other opportunity if you don’t sign, then you will have to do so, but have an exit clause in there in case later you don’t like what you see and were not warned about. If you are out of work, sign the new contract now, for it is always easier to get a new job when you already have a job, as unfair as that may be.</p>
<p>Venus, which has been out of service since July 22, will go direct earlier, on September 3. That’s great news because for Venus rules Gemini’s solar fifth house of romance. From then on, the course of true love should become far smoother than it has been, and a lot more fun, too.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>Also, this month you will host Mars, the high energy planet, in this same fifth house of true love for the first time in two years. Mars entered compatible Libra on August 27 and will remain until October 11—more good news. Mars will be perfectly supportive of your Sun and is sure to be stirring up news and opportunity. If your love life has been dull, it won’t be for long.</p>
<p>If you have been thinking about renting, buying, or selling, or finding ways to refresh your apartment or house, your dreams may be answered at the important new moon September 14 in your home sector.</p>
<p>Mercury will be opposed to Saturn, and that could mean you know you need to move for various reasons, but find the entire thought stressful. Yet things can work out far better than you expect because you have good-fortune Jupiter and unpredictable Uranus supporting your every move. At this new moon, Uranus could bring you a wonderful surprise tip on a new apartment or house or help you in other ways to make your home more stylish, inviting, and comfortable.</p>
<p>If on the other hand, you are attempting to help a parent find a doctor or review assisted living spaces, or help a grown daughter or son with their housing needs, this new moon can help you find the right answers.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>Your best part of the month to socialize will be at the full moon in Aries on September 29, influential for an additional five days. If you are single, both Mars and the full moon on September 29 could trigger a memorable, exciting first meeting with someone you may want to know better. Attached? You can grow closer if you give your partner tender loving care and your full, unwavering attention. Mars in Libra will be in charge of this full moon and will be in close communication at the time with his lover Venus in Leo. Venus will be newly alert by then, after spending 44 days of retrograde. Gemini, Leo, and Libra all get along beautifully, so your social outlook is bright.</p>
<p>Venus will be moving through in your travel sector at month’s end—is it time for a romantic weekend away? Yes! Leave September 29 to October 1 and, if you can get the extra vacation time, add a day or two on either end. It’s sure to be an enchanting weekend.</p>
