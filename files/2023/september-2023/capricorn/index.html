        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>This is an action-packed month for you that includes a big chance for career success, possibilities for exciting travel, impressive growth in communication skills, and, at month’s end, a good conclusion to a home or family matter. After two months of trying to see progress on many fronts, to no avail, suddenly September brings a slew of good news, almost all at once.</p>
<p>Capricorn is considered the most ambitious sign of the zodiac, with the little Goat determined to climb the mountain to get to the top, passing by other little animals that have given up, lying on the wayside on their backs, legs in the air, too tired to keep climbing. Capricorn’s motif, the Goat, was born with the right little hoofs and ankles to continue going along the harrowing, narrow, arduous path to the top that eventually continues above the tree line, where the air becomes thinner and rarified, but where the mountaintop comes clearly into view. That is reason enough to feed your passion to reach that lofty spot renewed.</p>
<p>This month you will have enormous career help from Mars, the action planet, which just entered Libra on August 27 for the first time in two years. Mars will energize your professional tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement for six and a half weeks and will leave on October 11. Remarkably, just as Mars leaves, you have a positive new moon solar eclipse in Libra, the very same part of your chart, coming on October 14. It’s friendly—a solar eclipse could place you just where you want to be professionally! Be ready. Eclipses are the most powerful tool the universe uses to affect change.</p>
<p>Start dropping hints that you are interested in assuming more responsibility at your present firm, and also discretely look for a job elsewhere if you feel there are not opportunities where you are now.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>You need good timing, and astrology can give it to you.</p>
<p>Venus has been retrograding since July 22, but Venus will go direct on September 3. Don’t do anything until Venus has turned direct. Venus is the natural ruler of your prestigious tenth house of professional advancement—the place Mars is currently visiting. The fact that Venus is imminently moving forward is very good news for your career progress. Venus RULES your solar career house (Libra) but is VISITING your financial eighth house (Leo), so if you have been waiting for a check or to untangle a financial matter, you will see progress from September 3 onward.</p>
<p>However, Mercury will still be retrograde and will turn direct on September 15.</p>
<p>I would like you to use that date, September 15, to begin your efforts for a new career position. When you have interviews during Mercury retrograde, they tend to come to nothing. There is an exception, however—if you are going back to a company you used to work with or a boss you used to work with and who wants you to join his company.</p>
<blockquote><p>There are so many signs that what you are doing as this month starts out will come to a highly successful, satisfying conclusion, either immediately or down the line.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>When I go on Discord.com for my twice a month meeting with readers, we all speak in a group by audio. (It usually is on a Sunday afternoon, and I post the date and time on Discord.) The sessions last two to three hours. There is no typing—all audio—I can hear you (and so can the group) and you can hear me (and so can the group). The questions that keep coming up always seem to be about a desire to change jobs for a better one. For that reason, I want you to have the very best possibility to get the job. (If you want to join us, you are welcome to do so. You need an invitation from me, so here it is: https://discord.gg/UsjnZ3YJPk</p>
<p>To make sure you have chosen the right day, you may want to get my app on the moon Void of Course called “Moonlight Phases, Susan Miller” on Apple or Google Play. It’s a one-time purchase of $7.99, and it goes through to the year 2050. (All days and months for the next 27 years. It is not a subscription.) Both of my apps have GPS built in so that you will get accurate information for your location when you travel (my other app is “Astrology Zone Horoscopes, Susan Miller” that you may be using to read this right now). Moonlight Phases is easy and fun to use, and most people use the app every day like I do. If you turn on notifications, you need not check—I send a notification to you so that you know when the moon is void and not void. (A void moon means that the moon is finished connecting to any planets in that sign, and when the moon is void, nothing will happen.)</p>
<p>My point is this: Make absolutely sure you do not schedule your interview when the moon is void. To find out more about a void moon, which is like Mercury retrograde, touch the word “void” on the screen when you have the app. I tell you the sign the moon is visiting that day and whether the moon is void or not (and for how long)—soon you will start to see which days favor you when the moon is in certain signs.</p>
<p>Once Venus goes direct on September 3, you can start calling for appointments at your hair stylist (or barber), dermatologist, cosmetic dentist, and others you consult to improve your appearance. I would wait until after Mercury goes direct to actually meet (beginning September 16) so that you have both planets strong and helping you.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>Now let’s turn to the start of the month when you went through a full moon in Pisces, 7 degrees, conjunct Saturn in your third house of communication, which actually occurred on August 30. You may have been given a contract to sign, but of course, since it is never ideal to sign while Mercury is retrograde, you may decide to put off the signing until the second part of the month. In fact, September 25 would be a perfect day to sign a contract.</p>
<p>If, however, you were afraid you’d lose the opportunity to rent the apartment you like or land the job you want, you may have to sign anyway, but do so only after you promise me you will show it to your lawyer first. See if she can put in an exit clause in case you change your mind about the offer after you are in the situation.</p>
<p>The third house rules all kinds of written and spoken communication, and this full moon will affect you through September 4. You may be giving a speech, finishing a podcast series, handing in a manuscript, report, white paper, or research findings as some examples. Alternatively, you may have been building a digital game, an app, new website, or an e-book.</p>
<p>Many planets are currently in earth signs like yours, protecting you, bringing out your talent for being objective and ensuring your new ideas are both based in the real world and are practical enough to produce for people to want to buy.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>As said, the full moon of August 30 will still be influential until September 4, and it came conjunct your ruling planet Saturn, so something about this recent effort that you made is coming to a grand conclusion. Apparently, it was highly important to you and hints that this project will have a role in your future. You were serious and determined with the project, the reason it could have staying power.</p>
<p>You may have had to travel, but not far, and possibly by car or rail in early September. If you need to travel (or want to) in the first few days of the month, make sure you have the correct address of your destination, and if driving, have your car and tires checked by your mechanic to be sure all are in good working order. You would likely be headed to a place near water.</p>
<p>Pisces (the sign of the August 30 full moon) is considered the most creative sign, for Pisces draws inspiration not only from the real word—this sign sees beauty others often overlook—but even more so from the subconscious and dreams. Neptune rules Pisces and is the dominant planet at the full moon, in charge of giving hints about the outcome of your efforts at the start to the month.</p>
<p>In early September, Neptune will be in perfect attitude to Uranus, the planet of the future, innovation, surprise, and all digital communication. Best of all, Uranus is based in your fifth house of creativity. Neptune is also being friendly to Pluto, planet of transportation. In addition to Uranus in Taurus and Pluto in Capricorn having individual friendly conversations with Neptune, they are also in conversation with each other in a highly supportive way! This is crazy and wonderful.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>There are so many signs that what you are doing as this month starts out will come to a highly successful, satisfying conclusion, either immediately or down the line.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that at the same time, your ruler Saturn, now in Pisces, will directly oppose the transiting Sun in Virgo, so the full moon will require a strenuous effort from you through early September. You may be concerned about money, either as it is tied to events of this August 30 full moon, or separately, needing to conserve money for another reason. You may also be waiting for a large check that has not arrived, but now that Venus, which rules money, is in healthy shape, you should see that check.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to the new moon, which is so outstanding for you, that will happen September 14.</p>
<p>You may be ready to hop a plane and go to an exciting destination mid-month at the new moon in Virgo at 22 degrees on September 14. You could not choose a better time to go. Mercury will turn direct the following day, September 15. Mercury rules travel, so it’s a blessing Mercury is going direct at this point. Pluto in Capricorn will send beautiful vibrations to that new moon, suggesting you may travel for business, and if so, you can strike a deal on that trip, for it appears there is good money to be made by taking that trip.</p>
<p>Uranus, not to be outdone by Pluto, will reach out to the new moon September 14 in Virgo too, and set up a sweet surprise for you from your house of romance and children. This tells me you might combine business with pleasure by bringing along your sweetheart or spouse and allowing a few extra days of leisure at your designation. That would be ideal. Or you can plan a surprise family trip with your children before the season changes and have bushels of giggles.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>If you simply cannot travel, you may be on the phone and email quite a bit with an international relationship. Or you may be involved with the import or export of ideas, goods, or services, and if so, business would be brisk. If you are waiting for an immigration matter to be resolved, this new moon could open up an opportunity to have your interview or to submit more information.</p>
<p>Mid-month, at the new moon September 14 and the weeks that follow, you can also make strides in higher education (college, graduate school), get good news in connection with the media (publishing, broadcasting, or digital), or hear a conclusion or development to a legal matter that should please you.</p>
<p>If your birthday falls on January 12, plus or minus five days, you will notice the uplifting effects of this lovely September 14 new moon. If you have Capricorn rising at 22 degrees or your natal moon or a planet in Capricorn, Virgo, Taurus, Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces at 22 degrees, in all cases plus or minus five degrees, then you, too, will reap benefits from this new moon.</p>
<p>What, you may ask, is your rising sign, and how can you know where the planets are? Your rising sign is the sign that was on the eastern horizon the moment you were born, and the only way to find your rising sign (also called your ascendant) is to have your chart done. Having your chart done will also tell you where all the planets were when you were born.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>And now you can do your chart on my Astrologyzone.com site for FREE—as many time as you’d like (this isn’t available on my app). Just click on the “Free Natal Birth Chart” image, which is above the fold on my homepage. Your rising sign is just as important as your Sun sign, so once you know your rising sign, you should read for both. Then you’ll have a complete forecast for yourself each month. Your natal chart is the basis for everything and will never change throughout your entire life.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to your home and property, which will receive a boost at the full moon in Aries at 6 degrees on September 29. You may be closing on the purchase of a house or apartment, or you may see workmen, such as contractors, repairmen, painters, IT people, or others, finish up their job. Your landscaper might be done beautifying your property, or you may get a delivery of a new piece of furniture.</p>
<p>If your home is fine as is, you might be renting a vacation house for a trip you plan to take soon, renting out your property to a location scout for a movie, or renting space for travelers through Airbnb or other similar service. You may conclude the sale of property at this time. Alternatively, if you are looking for a roommate or a tenant for your other property (or two-family home), start your search on September 15, 18, or 19. Name the person you select on September 25 or at this full moon, September 29.</p>
<p>If you have been working to help a parent with a question, such as to find a new doctor that could make a more accurate diagnosis than your parent’s current doctor, by all means start looking for one now, and you will likely find the right doctor. If your parent needs a new place to live, this full moon will bring good options and a final conclusion.</p>
<p>This is a happy full moon, too. Mars will take the lead and reach out to his lover Venus—how good can this get? Mars and Venus are known as the cosmic lovers, and when these two planets are in communication, it almost always produces a happy result. This bodes so well for you!</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>As a Capricorn, you are known to care very much about career advancement, and to that end, you work consistently hard and smart. It is logical that you expect to see steady progress, but the past two months have found your plans gripped in delays and stymied by the indecision of VIPs, along with a general lack of movement forward, bringing low productivity overall.</p>
<p>It’s been frustrating, but that’s because seven out of eight planets in our solar system were languishing in retrograde. Among those seven retrograde planets were two of the three planets that affect us the most when retrograde—Venus and Mercury—because they orbit close to Earth. (Mars is the third planet that orbits near Earth, but Mars is, thankfully, not retrograde—the only one of the eight planets that was functioning well.)</p>
<p>The little Goat, the symbol for Capricorn, climbs nimbly to the very top of the mountain, passing other animals trying to navigate the same upward path. You have the skill and the desire to scale the scary narrow paths that exist on the side of the mountain above the tree line, where gale force winds at the top prevent vegetation growth. The air gets thinner, and only the few can make it to the top. Your determination fuels you, and that’s why you succeed when others don’t.</p>
<p>This month you will be fired up with enthusiasm to make your move toward a better job. You sense this is the right time to act, and it is, but you will have to be cautious and clever too, for you will encounter a few obstacles.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>In your favor is Mars, now in Libra, at the very pinnacle in your chart, filling your prestigious tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement with brilliant light. This is the first time in two years you have had Mars in the perfect position to help you get ahead. Mars, which entered this area of your chart last month on August 27, will stay until next month on October 11. Mars is a high energy planet, so in those six-plus weeks, you can make enormous professional progress. Ironically, a new moon will appear in the same career sector next month on October 14 and help you further.</p>
<p>Any job you look at will be one that comes with heavy responsibility, judging by the position of Venus, which governs your career. From July 22 to September 3, Venus would be retrograde, so if you were interviewing for a job, or even hoping to get your foot in the door to see a powerful person, the process was difficult. Things will get better now, but you will need to be buttoned up and organized to land the job you want, for the competition will be stiff. That has never deterred you. Keep to your plan, dear Capricorn—you have many supportive planets to win the job you want.</p>
<p>Before you start interviewing for your new job or angling for a promotion, you may be thinking of taking time off for a vacation. The full moon of August 30, influential until September 4, will be coaxing you to go. However, Saturn is conjunct that full moon, and Saturn is your ruler, so you may have a goal to complete on the trip you may take or have work to complete before you can leave. If you get to go, your quick trip would not be far from home and would likely be to a place near water.</p>
<p>If you are in a contractual negotiation at the start of the month, take your time. You may have no choice, for finding agreement will be a slow process, so be patient. Delays will benefit you. Mercury, which rules all contracts, started to retrograde last month on August 23 and will go direct September 15. That means the second half of September would be a far better time to negotiate and to sign (September 25 would be an ideal day to sign).</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>If you rush and sign during Mercury retrograde (prior to September 15), you may later regret making that agreement. If you are concerned you will lose the opportunity if you don’t sign, then do, but realize you may discover later that there were parts of the deal that create jeopardy for you or that are not fair. When you sign with Mercury retrograde, you may choose to leave the situation sooner than you expected. If by not signing you would lose the offer, make plans for a future move again up the road.</p>
<p>The new moon on September 14 will be a better time to take a trip, and it looks as though you would travel farther away. If you go for business, you would find the trip to be profitable. Or you could plan a trip with the one you love—it could turn out to be magically romantic and a great way to rejuvenate.</p>
<p>All kinds of international relationships will shine after the September 14 new moon as well. If you deal in the import or export of ideas, goods, or services, business should be brisk. Matters of immigration, passports, citizenship, residency, and visas will get a good start. This new moon will receive golden beams from surprise-a-minute Uranus in a heavenly trine position, which will also send a magnificent beam to the Sun and new moon, so you might get a thrilling unexpected breakthrough. Other areas of gain: matters involving writing or speaking (broadcasting and publishing), higher education, and the legal system.</p>
<p>If you plan to go on a trip, Mercury, the planet ruling travel and intellectual matters (like contracts), will receive an opposition from Saturn, so you may have to finish up work (or a negotiation) before you can leave.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>Your home and family will require your full attentional at the full moon late in the month on September 29, effective for five days. You may be moving, renovating, making repairs, or receiving a delivery of furniture. No matter what topic you are thinking about—home, other property you may own, rent, or want to sell or buy, or it concerns your help for a family member—you will be in luck.</p>
<p>Things will culminate on the full moon September 29 and finish up within five days of this date. If you need money to cover the expenses, your outlook is excellent for finding the funds from your banker, a venture capitalist, or your family.</p>
