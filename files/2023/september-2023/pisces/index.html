        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>This is a good month, especially after you get through the somber full moon of August 30 in Pisces, 7 degrees. You may still be feeling the effects of this full moon as you enter September and as that full moon gradually wanes, by September 4.</p>
<p>Ever since Saturn entered your sign on March 7, you have been taking new responsibilities. The load may be heavy, but at the same time, you are learning a great deal—Saturn is the planet that matures us. Saturn also teaches us that the things that we worked the hardest on are the ones we are proudest to say we accomplished. Readers who were born February 20-28 are feeling full effects of Saturn in Pisces now.</p>
<p>A need for stability and security drives a lot of your thinking now, the reason many people with Saturn in the house of their natal Sun tend to start a business, marry, go to graduate school, write a book, buy a house, or have a baby—one of these or another big step you have taken, or will take, may appeal to you now.</p>
<p>Said another way, having Saturn conjunct the transiting full moon often brings on a yearning to create long-term stability and a sturdy foundation for your future. You want your time to count for something important, your decisions in coming months will reflect this underlying serious determination to accomplish that.</p>
<p>Saturn is opposite the Sun this month (and especially right now if you have a February birthday), so take good care of yourself and do all the things that your doctor tells you to do to stay strong and healthy. Have routine screenings even though you are very busy—don’t skip them. Ask your doctor if you need to take certain vitamins, a flu shot, or other preventative medicine. Check, in particular, iron and calcium levels in your body—Saturn can be draining to both—and schedule a blood test to find out. (Don’t just take more vitamins without knowing. You can hurt yourself.) Saturn in Pisces can be draining, and you will certainly need more sleep.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>Finally, the full moon August 30 was a litmus test of your closest personal relationship, romantic or business. If you are happy, and judging by your chart it seems so, you now know your relationship is in good shape. Jupiter, the good fortune planet (which is also Pisces’ ruler, giving Jupiter more weight in your horoscope) was in perfect angle to Mercury, which rules your closet relationships. Communication between you and your partner seem especially fine-tuned, and as a result, you understand one another. If you are not happy but still want to fix the relationship, this would be a superb month (after September 15, more on why later) to start couple’s therapy.</p>
<p>This full moon of August 30 had Neptune in the lead, and happily, Uranus in Taurus was in perfect angle to Neptune in Pisces. (As Neptune is in the sign it rules, Pisces, Neptune’s influence is stronger.) Pluto in Capricorn, from the other side of the sky, sent Neptune supportive beams, too. If you feel you need quality time with your romantic partner to bond closer, see if you can take a little weekend trip not far from home during the second half of the month. Your third house of travel is glowing, particularly if you want to fan the fires of love.</p>
<p>Since July 22, Venus has been retrograde, and Venus rules all the fun in life: beauty, luxury, romance, and in some cases, shopping for expensive designer items. I wrote a lot about Venus retrograde for you in your August report. I had asked you to refrain from making an appointment with your dermatologist or cosmetic dentist for treatment because you might not like the results, and those experts are expensive. It was OK to see your hair stylist for routine trims and touch ups, but not for radical changes to the cut or color of your hair.</p>
<blockquote><p>On September 14 a golden triangle will link the Sun and new moon, Uranus, and Pluto to bring you joy through travel, friends, and if you have one, your romantic partner.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>My daughter Chrissie called this week to ask when Venus would go direct. Chrissie wanted to have her hair trimmed and the color refreshed, and I said she could do that any time. She said, “No, I don’t like what my stylist did last time, so I am taking no chances.” Chrissie is Pisces with Libra rising, and Venus rules Libra.</p>
<p>Venus retrograde is a kind of somber time—not great for lavish parties or buying expensive jewelry, not the time to visit the spa for a pricy treatment or to stay at a multi-star hotel for a relaxing time away. It is not the time to have a first date either, no matter how exciting the chemistry may appear at the start. With Venus retrograde built into the birth of your new relationship, feelings are due to cool off soon and fall flat. Wait—you’ll be glad you did.</p>
<p>Thank goodness Venus goes direct on September 3 and will not retrograde again for 18 months. I think rather than resume activities on September 3, wait for Mercury to go direct, too. Mercury has been in retrograde since August 23, but will go direct on September 15 (the reason I mentioned this date earlier).</p>
<p>Mercury retrograde can be a frustrating aspect, and this time, Mercury was made stronger by being in Virgo, the sign Mercury rules. If you were dealing with difficulties in regard to technology, machines that suddenly showed wear and tear and needed repair, mail that never reached you, an inability to move projects forward because you were unable to reach VIPs for approvals, these and more difficulties can be traced to Mercury retrograde.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>You may have noticed my Mercury retrograde dilemma. My Twitter account (@astrologyzone) was hacked, and I cannot get in. Twitter says they can’t verify that I am really me. I have been replying to my case number, sending evidence to prove my identity, including my trademark paperwork, to no avail. The hacker changed my phone number, email address, and my security questions. He also stole my identity elsewhere. My IT team has a good idea of who did this to me, but I am remaining mum.</p>
<p>I have 520,000 followers on Twitter who I want to be back in touch with soon. I love Twitter! My last post was August 13, and after that I could not get in. With all this going on, its’s been a time consuming process, and it’s a miracle I can write. If you know anyone at Twitter who can help me, please write to me at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="65361016040b280c0909001725041611170a090a021c1f0a0b004b060a08">[email&#160;protected]</a>.</p>
<p>Thank goodness Mercury will go direct on Friday, September 15, just one day after the new moon appears on Thursday, September 14. You will see a big blast of energy once you get to Monday, September 18.</p>
<p>The new moon of September 14 is one of the sweetest new moons I have seen in a long time. It looks as though you will be joining forces with another person. This partnership may be created for a business reason, when you hire an expert to collaborate with you on a project, and you have a specific goal. If you are joining forces in love, this new moon bodes well for you to get engaged or married soon after September 14.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>At the new moon of September 14, you will have a rare, golden triangle of harmony appearing in the evening sky, linking the new moon and Sun in Virgo (partnership house) to Uranus in Taurus, the planet of genius ideas and expression (communication house) and to Pluto in Capricorn, the third point of the triangle (house of community, friendships, groups and hopes and wishes). This all adds up to a sterling merging of energies. Pluto’s involvement as the planet of transformation suggests you will like the outcome.</p>
<p>For example, if you hired a designer to redo your website or a producer to help you with your podcast series and are starting the process of building your project on September 15 or later, your timing is perfect. You would be reaching your community in a clear, stylish, organized, and exciting way. This is an example, and it would fit many different kinds of communication-oriented projects that you require an expert (such as a producer) to help make it happen.</p>
<p>You are moving into a high spending period, for Mars just entered Libra, your eighth house of other people’s money. The eighth house rules bank loans, credit cards, taxes, insurance payments and payouts, commissions, royalties, and bonuses, as some examples. You may be investing in yourself (such as to go to college or graduate school) or buying a new condo. Or you may be investing in new equipment or coming out with a new product if self-employed. If you own property, you may hire a contractor to upgrade and refurbish it in order to appreciate its value. You seem to have a good goal in mind, and you will make more money later as a result. Money will flow out, but money will flow back in, too.</p>
<p>You have a lot going on in your life regarding money. A new set of eclipses are moving to Aries and Libra, and this series will refresh your source(s) of income in both of your financially oriented houses (second and eighth houses).</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>The first eclipse in this series recently occurred in Aries at 29 degrees on April 19. Now the second one is due next month and will arrive as a new moon solar eclipse in Libra, 21 degrees, on October 14.</p>
<p>New sources of income will be presented, and you may reorganize and prioritize increasing your income while you go through this process. The October 14 eclipse will be very positive—new moon solar eclipses mark beginnings. This new family of eclipses will come by every six months in pairs, up to March 29, 2025, when this series will end with a solar eclipse in Aries, 9 degrees.</p>
<p>Speaking of money, this month you have a very positive full moon on September 29 at 6 degrees Aries, your second house of earned income. This full moon might bring money owed to you, or you may need to pay to cover a previous financial obligation.</p>
<p>Mars will take the lead at this full moon, and Mars will send a perfect, direct beam to his lover, Venus. Venus is tied to money (in addition to love, luxury, and beauty). Venus is currently in your work-a-day sector (sixth house), which tells me it is likely you will get an assignment or offer for a new job at the full moon September 29, plus five days.</p>
<p>Venus is in Leo, so it could come from a luxury brand or have something to do with the arts, music, or entertainment industries. Leo also rules the needs and care for children—education, clothing, children’s books and programming, toys, and so forth. One of these area may prove stellar for you and your income.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>So although money is flowing out, dear Pisces, I see you have possibilities to see money flow in, too.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You have been accepting additional life responsibilities, but over the August 30 weekend, the full moon in Pisces may have you feeling overwhelmed. In life we don’t always know when thing will lift and life will become easier. The weight of the world seems heavier when you are tired, so during the time that full moon will wane (until September 4), give yourself the gift of peace, quiet, and a slow, relaxed schedule.</p>
<p>Venus, which provides much of the fun in life, has been at reduced power while she has been retrograde, starting July 22, but Venus will go direct on September 3, after which Venus will get stronger each day. If life seemed lackluster during the past few weeks, you now know why (blame a sleepy Venus), but things will soon change noticeably for the better. Indeed, more fun and love is on the way no matter whether you are single or married.</p>
<p>When it comes to a close relationship, keep your eye on the new moon in Virgo on September 14 and the weeks that follow. This new moon will be a gift for starting and improving your interactions with a committed partner in love or business. If you are starting a new, serious alliance, you may find the agreement (business contract or pre-nuptial agreement) has a few clauses that need to be adjusted. It will take time to sort out, so have your lawyer be the intermediary to negotiate for you. Jupiter, the good fortune planet, is currently in your third house of communication, so you will find the perfect words to gracefully clarify your agreement.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>This new moon of September 14 is quite special. The Sun and new moon in Virgo will link directly to Uranus in Taurus, your communication, travel, and contractual house, and to Pluto in Capricorn, your friendship house, forming a golden triangle of harmony. All these happy celestial bodies will work together to bring you joy through travel, friends, and if you have one, your romantic partner. If you are working with an expert on a new project, things should go exceptionally well, partly because the communication will be warm and clear. New moons open a door to new experiences in the weeks ahead. You will also have opportunities to take a quick spontaneous weekend getaway, to refresh and renew your spirit.</p>
<p>Another theme will emerge this month, one focusing strongly on money. You may be planning to invest in an upgrade to your business, you may be starting a new business, or you may be thinking about purchasing real estate. You could be about to start a massive a home renovation, or maybe you need money to invest in your child’s education.</p>
<p>Don’t sign contracts or begin anything new until after the new moon (September 14) and Mercury goes direct—September 15 and beyond. Monday, September 18, and Tuesday, September 19, are spectacular days to begin any of these projects, and for signing papers, September 25 can’t be beat.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>Mars is now in Libra, your financial eighth house, so it is likely you will be talking to a banker about a loan or mortgage. Mars entered this part of your chart late last month on August 27 and will remain in Libra until October 11. This will be a costly period where you are likely to spend heavily, but perhaps you have planned for this, so the money will be well spent.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Mercury is still retrograde, a holdover from August 23, but will go direct on September 15. Sign nothing until after that date.</p>
<p>Another financial moment will come up at the full moon September 29 in entrepreneurial Aries, accenting your second house of earned income. Pluto will be in fine angle to that full moon, suggesting an opportunity to make money will come up through the kindness of a friend’s tip or introduction. Mars will be the key planet at that full moon, and Mars’ signal to Venus in your sixth house of work-a-day projects suggests a new assignment is about to come in, which could bring in welcome additional money to your bank account.</p>
