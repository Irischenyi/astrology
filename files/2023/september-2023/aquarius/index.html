        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>This will be a solidly fortunate, happy month, but you may doubt me as the month begins. This is a month cut in two like a loaf of Italian bread sliced in half—you will like the second half much more than the first half. No matter what happens in the first half of September, blue skies and an open road will appear later. In truth, this will be in sharp contrast to the frustrating weeks you experienced even earlier and have just come through in July and August.</p>
<p>As you enter September, you may still be feeling the aftereffects of the full moon that fell at the end of last month, August 30, which appeared in Pisces. This full moon arrived next to Saturn, the planet that teaches life lessons—Saturn gave the full moon a serious tone. It fell in your second house of earned income, so you may have had to pay a large bill. Saturn was opposed to the Sun and conjunct the full moon, and you may have found paying this large amount hard to do. Full moons have five days to deliver their news, so if you didn’t notice anything in late August, you still have until September 4 to hear the news.</p>
<p>If you did not get a large bill, alternatively, you may be dealing with identify theft at your bank or with a credit card. Keep watch over your bank and credit card statements.</p>
<p>There is another way this can work out as well. Pisces is a water sign, so you may have had (or will have) problems with water. Neptune will be opposite Mercury at the time, so there’s a veil of mystery about what is going on, but money seems to be at the core of the quagmire.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>This somber full moon was not helped by the position of Mars. This action planet has been in Virgo, touring your eighth house of other people’s money, from July 10 to August 27. You may have been doing a lot of financial management, planning, and organizing, but also spending. Mars in this position is known to raise expenses. You may have been investing in your business or yourself by furthering your education, purchasing new computer equipment, or making other investments. You may have recently bought something expensive, such as a car, a beautiful piece of art, or expensive jewelry, or soon will, and that may account for the large outgo of cash lately. Mars in Virgo for most of July and August could have brought on a financial workout for you. On top of this came the full moon of August 30 to make the experience even more stressful.</p>
<p>As you enter September, you became free from Mars in Virgo on August 27, so you will find your money will be much easier to manage. Mars is not coming back to this part of your chart for two years. The full moon of August 30 put a final punctuation mark—a period—on that recent chapter.</p>
<p>If you are hoping to find a way to earn more money, you are in luck, for the new moon of September 14 in Virgo at 22 degrees will light this very same eighth house of other people’s money. New moons mark a time for fresh starts because a new planetary cycle forms and brings new opportunities There is symmetry and balance in the universe—when there is too much outgo, soon there is more income.</p>
<blockquote><p>The new moon of September 14 will send a lovely beam to your ruling planet Uranus, the planet of unexpected developments, bringing an upbeat financial surprise.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>This area of your chart also rules performance-based money, such as a commissions, royalties, or residuals, or even a special bonus you would receive if you hit a certain figure—this is the area that glows for you and where you would do well. Some people work on a combination of both, part flat salary and part commission or bonus if they hit a certain target.</p>
<p>The eighth house rules credit cards, bank loans, student loans, venture capital, insurance payouts, bonuses, valuable gifts or prize money, pensions, inheritances, severance, mortgages (both new and refinanced), tax payments and refunds, scholarships, financial aid, government financial assistance programs, and so forth. This same area of your chart also rules special benefits you might get at work, like vacation time, flex time, health insurance, the key to the corporate gym, and other nice benefits that your company may offer employees of your caliber.</p>
<p>Another function of the eighth house is to coax us to get things in order, like seeing a lawyer to draw up a will, health proxy, or estate plan. For you, this is a good month to do these types of activities.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the middle of the month, September 14. As just mentioned above, there’s a new moon in Virgo that day that sparkles so brightly! I love this new moon because it will send a lovely beam to your ruling planet Uranus, the planet of unexpected developments, based in your home sector, bringing an upbeat financial surprise. Money is most likely to emanate from a parent or other member of your family, but it could also come from a bank, if you are in the market to buy a house and need a mortgage, or even from the seller of a house, who may be willing to drop the price of his property so you could afford to buy it. If you put in a bid on a house or condo after September 14, you have a good chance of winning the bid.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>When you have Uranus in a favorable place regarding a new moon (as is happening September 14), that’s great for everyone of every sign. When you have your ruler in a highly friendly angle to the Sun and new moon like you do (Uranus rules Aquarius), this is weighted even more positively in your chart than for others of other signs.</p>
<p>Some people who have a new moon in the eighth house schedule surgery. If you need surgery, and it’s not an emergency, schedule it for the second half of the month—a superb time for the procedure would be after September 15 (due to Mercury retrograde—see next paragraph). But if you need an important operation urgently, don’t wait—just have it. The reason surgery comes under the eighth house is that it is also called the house of transformation. In this case, the surgeon removes what has been hurting you so that you can heal.</p>
<p>Last month Mercury began to retrograde on August 23 and is still retrograde as you enter September. Mercury will go direct on September 15, so until then, expect delays and miscommunications. This is the planet ruling all communication, negotiation, the post office, couriers and common private carriers (FedEx, UPS, DHL and more), telephones and apps, and all electronic and mechanical products, such as cars, computers, smart phones, and more. When a machine starts to show wear and tear, it is usually at a time Mercury is retrograde, the reason many of us wind up at the repair shop during these periods.</p>
<p>Mercury will still be retrograde in your financial sector when September begins. I feel a check may have been held up for a few weeks, or worse, you may have been subject to identify theft or mail fraud. I hope this has not happened to you. (My Twitter account was hacked, and Twitter still doesn’t believe I am who I say I am. Yikes!) Mercury will go direct one day after the new moon of September 14, on September 15. How perfect is that? As you see, the second half of the month will go so much better than the first half!</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>A major, rare writers’ strike has been happening in Los Angeles since May 2. That date came just three days prior to the unfavorable, tension-producing full moon eclipse in Scorpio, a zodiac sign associated with large financial budgets. That was a very difficult eclipse.</p>
<p>Mercury rules writers, contracts, scripts, publicity, appointments, travel, negotiation, and contracts, so while Mercury has been out of phase, it was nearly impossible to make progress. Although Mercury went retrograde on August 23, everyone always feels the approaching Mercury retrograde two weeks ahead of the turnaround date. Things were slowing down, and no one was even trying to communicate.</p>
<p>The new moon of Virgo, 22 degrees, on of September 14 will bring the first ray of hope to those striking, for thankfully, as said, Mercury goes direct the following day, September 15. This will be the first chance for both sides to come to the table to have a productive, meaningful exchange of information in the hopes of finding a solution. That’s not to say the sides will come to an agreement this month, but it is the first chance they will have had to hear one another.</p>
<p>By the Los Angeles charter, the city is Virgo (born September 4, 1781). From July 10 to August 27 this year, Mars was touring Virgo and stirring the pot, causing disagreements and anger—Virgo is the sign not only of Los Angeles but also the sign of the writer and communicator. Mars left Virgo on August 27, another hopeful sign. Now Mars is in Libra, the sign of collaboration and legal matters and the sign that strives for justice and fairness. It is said that on the date Los Angeles was born, gentle, luxury-loving and glamourous Libra was rising. Mars is in Libra now, so this might give energy to the talks, something that has been lacking so far.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>Actors are on strike too, and Venus has also been retrograding since July 22, a very long time, in the sign that rules entertainment and actors—Leo.</p>
<p>Venus will go direct this month on September 3, earlier than Mercury. This is another hopeful sign. You see that this situation will affect us all, well beyond the confines of Los Angeles, because both sides are wrestling with the sticky and hard-to-decide topic of the role of AI, artificial intelligence, in everyday work.</p>
<p>All writers and actors in the world are watching what happens. Me, too! I refuse to use AI to forecast your horoscopes, even though a small number of astrologers are frankly saying they are embracing AI totally for writing their forecasts. I still feel human experience and judgment counts. If you know me, you know I love new technology. I feel when dealing with delicate human emotions, such as in psychology and astrology, for example, neither are suitable for AI.</p>
<p>At the new moon of September 14, Uranus in Taurus will be ideally oriented to the Sun and new moon in Virgo to exact perfect degree. In terms of the strikes in LA, someone may come up with an idea out of the blue that works! It would be an idea that was not considered before. Uranus rules strikes, innovations, and all things newly invented—therefore, Uranus rules AI, the topic on the table in LA. The fact that this new moon has such a friendly Uranus is another hopeful element.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>Your ruler, dear Aquarius, is Uranus, so the fact that the prime planet will be so beautifully positioned on September 14 is fantastic for you, too. Uranus is traveling in Taurus, your home and family sector, so you may get good news about your physical residence or other property or about a family member, most likely your parent. Or you may receive something wonderful (or news) FROM your parent, such as a special gift your mother or father may have for you for no particular reason.</p>
<p>A new moon like the one September 14 (which is as sweet as sugar) is influential for six months—yes, it has a long tail, unlike a full moon, which delivers its message quickly. Although a new moon can affect you for six months, it is a strongest in the week it appears, and very gradually decreases in strength over those six months until it has spent all its energy, and it meets the full moon of the same sign.</p>
<p>This September 14 new moon is one of the most favorable I’ve seen in a long time. For you, dear Aquarius, it’s all about other people’s money and how that money is directed to you. I love Monday, September 18, and Tuesday, September 19—perfect days to start anything new or to plan or discuss money matters, company benefits, savings, and investments, or to do estate planning. September 25 is incredibly favorable for making a promise or agreement, signing papers, traveling, making a pitch or presentation, or handing in a manuscript.</p>
<p>After you do all this financial thinking, you will be ready to take a break and perhaps long to get away. You have a peach of a full moon coming in Aries on Friday, September 29. Although this looks like it will only be a weekend trip (September 29 to October 1), if you can go, you would surely have fun. See if you can find a location with plenty of sunshine where you can do some adventuresome sports or hiking.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>Next month you will have a full moon lunar eclipse in Scorpio, your career sector, and it’s beautifully aspected—Jupiter will arrive on the arm of the elegant full moon October 28. You might have very exciting news coming in regard to your career.</p>
<p>October looks busy and very favorable, so if you can take that weekend away over September 29 to October 1, that would be a good idea. You will want to enter next month rested and full of energy.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>As you enter September, you may be feeling squeezed for money. The culprit would be the full moon of August 30, which landed in your second house of income, savings, and possessions. You may already know about a payment you will need to make quickly, but it may be difficult to handle. If you don’t yet know about this payment, all full moons extend for five days beyond the day they appear, so the payment would be due no later than September 4.</p>
<p>Your spouse, agent, or business partner won’t be much help because Venus is approaching a hard angle to Uranus. Neptune will be opposed to Mars, clouding financial matters and leaving you with a feeling of uncertainty. Not knowing all the facts about a financial situation can be maddening, but be patient—you will know all you need to know soon.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>Mercury went retrograde last month, starting on August 23 and will continue in his backward path until September 15. That is complicating matters more than normal because even though Mercury retrograde slows things down, Mercury is retrograde this time in its home sign, Virgo, so Mercury’s haywire effects are even stronger. Nothing important can be settled until after September 15.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the day prior, Thursday, September 14, is the date of a glorious new moon in Virgo that will help you in your quest to find ways to bring in more cash. Financial negotiations of all types will improve enormously. The heavy cloud cover you have been operating under for two months will lift, leaving open a path for clear communication.</p>
<p>If you are in the middle of any talks involving money, including one that requires a division of property, such as in a divorce, you will likely be pleased with the turn of events. Keep expectations reasonable, though, as Saturn will oppose Mercury, so every point of the contract or negotiation will be thoroughly discussed and put under a magnifying glass.</p>
<p>Good-fortune Jupiter is currently in your fourth house of real estate, property, home, and family, so if you are working on one of those matters, things will go especially well. In fact, this area will be nearly oblivious to the other more challenging aspects. Indeed, home, property, and family are lucky for you this year and will continue to be until May 25, 2024.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>If you are in a negotiation, you may come to a final agreement within five days of the full moon September 29. Full moons end matters, so work toward this as a possible date to put talks to rest. Mercury will be in perfect communication with good-fortune Jupiter, so this is as good as it gets! What a wonderful day, especially to sign a contact—it does not get better than this!</p>
<p>At this same full moon, September 29, you will be aching to travel, and even a short weekend trip would go far to refresh you. Mars and Venus will be in sync, a lovely indication of a possible romantic time, when fun, leisure, luxury, good food, and conversation will take center stage.</p>
<p>Venus had been in weak retrograde mode in your opposite sign of Leo, your partnership sector, since July 22 and will go direct this month on September 3. Although a romantic significant other cannot help much with a financial dilemma you may still be thinking about, at least your relationship will become sweeter and closer from now on.</p>
<p>If instead of a romantic getaway you decide your trip will be the perfect time to give quality time to your children and/or your parents, that would be possible too, and it would go exceptionally well. All concerned will appreciate your full attention. No matter what reason for your trip, you will be wrapping up September with a big red bow.</p>
