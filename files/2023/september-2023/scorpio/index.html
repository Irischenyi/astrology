        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>September will start to quicken the pace and lift your spirits, and you will find that much of the work you’ve been doing over the past two months will start to click into place. You may have feared that few things would be working as you felt they should, but by September you will be able to step back and see that indeed, you have accomplished a lot. You’ve been concentrating on several fronts, each separate from the other, but now those pieces will begin to coalesce into a whole.</p>
<p>On September 3 Venus will go direct, after having been retrograde in Leo since July 22, cruising in your prestigious tenth house of career. This means Venus will be shining like a beacon at the very top of your chart, the area that reflects your reputation, leadership, and contribution to others in your industry. Soon you will see how much you are valued in your company by colleagues, clients, and subordinates too, for Venus, newly energized, will show you proof of this in many ways. Best of all, your popularity is, and will, remain high for Venus will continue in this sign until October 8.</p>
<p>You have Leo, the sign of entertainment, at the very pinnacle of your solar chart, so you may work with celebrities, actors, musicians, artists, or others in the fields of theatre, concerts, television, streaming, or in traditional publishing or the digital world. One of these areas may be your focus. Or you may work with luxury brands, designer fashion, elegant new or historic estate jewelry, expensive real estate, yachts, expensive automobiles, or private planes and luxury travel. Additionally, Leo also rules any topic associated with royalty.</p>
<p>Leo also rules the care for children, so some example of Leo industries would include children’s clothing, toys, books, movies, TV programming, children’s theatre, and children’s education. (Infants, maternity, and the needs of the new mothers come under the rulership of Cancer.) With Venus touring this sector, your solar tenth house, these areas are especially fortunate for you.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>You may work in one of these Leo-oriented areas that I have listed because Leo is located at the highest point in your Scorpio solar chart, and you will find Venus in Leo—the solar mid-heaven point— to be quite a blessing.</p>
<p>Not working in any one of these industries? No matter what industry you work in, during September through early October, you will find you are prized at work and that colleagues will admire and appreciate your efforts. As said, Venus will remain in Leo until October 8.</p>
<p>Mercury will continue to be retrograde in Virgo as you enter the month, but it will turn direct on September 15.</p>
<p>Last month you dealt with a lot of delays, redo’s, reversals, forgetfulness, and indecision from others—this list goes on. Mercury rules communication, travel, the post office and couriers like FedEx, DHL, and UPS, messengers, transportation, shipping, and all machines with moving parts or electronic chips. These areas are particularly sensitive to Mercury’s scrambled vibes.</p>
<blockquote><p>To say you are in line to get heaps of praise for your work is an understatement. Knowing this in advance, pull out all the stops to create the best work you can do.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>This is why it is not a good time to sign a contract (communication) when Mercury is retrograde. This particular retrograde period has been harder mostly because Mercury has been—and will continue to be—in Virgo, the sign it rules.</p>
<p>If you have to sign a contract, try to put off the signing until after September 15 to protect the agreement and ensure your venture will go smoothly. If you fear you will lose the offer or opportunity if you don’t sign (for instance, a new job or a great apartment), then you will have to sign papers, yet you can always make changes up ahead. It would be a good idea to have some sort of exit clause.</p>
<p>If you have to sign with Mercury retrograde, at the very least, hire a lawyer to look at the contract before you sign. You need to give the lawyer time to make any small corrections he feels would be necessary to keep the contract fair for both sides.</p>
<p>Wait to buy a computer, car, smart phone, printer, TV, or any electronic item you might need—you can do so with confidence after September 15. (I would also suggest leaving a space of a few days after that date to allow Mercury to fully regulate.)</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>You will love the new pace of the second half of September—it will be like a powerful gust of wind coming in your window. The energy will be high, and the tempo will keep things moving forward.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the shape of September, starting with the top.</p>
<p>As you enter the month, you will have just come through a full moon in Pisces, 7 degrees, on August 30. This full moon fell in your fifth house of romance, specifically affecting Scorpios who are single and dating, or one of your children. Saturn was conjunct that full moon, indicating either serious news or your readiness to make a well-considered commitment.</p>
<p>If you have been dating one person seriously, it looks like it may be time for you to decide about the future of that relationship. If you are in love, you may now get engaged or wed. If you have strong doubts, this may be the moment you suggest you both go to couple’s therapy, or if you are really unhappy, break up.</p>
<p>There is another way this may work out. If you have a child, you may commit to sending your child to a certain school or to finding a tutor or another way to help him or her. If you have not yet noticed news, it may still come. Full moons are influential for five days after the moon appear and then starts to wane—that brings you to September 4.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>Mercury, which takes the lead at this full moon, will receive beautiful vibrations from Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, and from Uranus, the planet of surprise, which might give this episode a positive, surprise twist. It looks like you will find the results of this full moon to be pleasing to you no matter which way things go.</p>
<p>If your birthday falls within five days of October 30, you felt (or will feel) this full moon directly. The same is true if you have Scorpio rising or your natal moon in Scorpio, in either case at 7 degrees (plus or minus five degrees), or have a natal planet in Scorpio, Cancer, Pisces, Taurus, Virgo, or Capricorn within five degrees of 7 degrees.</p>
<p>You might be asking just what is a rising sign and how do you find it? Or just where are your “natal” planets? Your rising sign is the sign that was on the eastern horizon at the moment you were born, and the only way to discover your rising sign (also called your ascendant) is to have your chart done.</p>

        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>This month will put a strong emphasis on your personal life, for the sweet new moon of September 14 in Virgo, 22 degrees, will open up your eleventh house of friendship. This new moon will allow you to make many new friends in coming weeks and also give you opportunities to reconnect and make arrangements with present friends. Events may start to dot your calendar, and after having spent a lot of time concentrating on your career, it will be fun to have new social events to look forward to. Your social life will become much more fun.</p>
<p>The eleventh house, the place in your chart where the new moon will occur on September 15, is also the house of hopes and wishes, so something you dearly want to happen may now start to form in front of your eyes. There is a reason the ancient astrologers would refer to the eleventh house as the house of joy. If there is something you are yearning for, begin to take steps toward that dream. A new moon like the one September 14 in Virgo does not affect you for just a day or a week—it has a long tail, and will affect you up to six months.</p>
<p>This new moon of September 14 in Virgo will be outstanding because it will create a golden triangle of supreme harmony in the sky, linking a number of planets that will work to your benefit. The Sun and new moon in Virgo will be at the first point of this golden triangle, receiving shimmering rays from Uranus in Taurus, your partnership/marriage house (the second point of the triangle) and from Pluto in Capricorn, your third house of short travel, agreements, and promises, and the final point of this golden triangle.</p>
<p>Pluto is in such late degrees of Capricorn that it is straddling the cusp of your fourth house too, suggesting you may have happy experiences with family ahead, specifically with siblings or cousins and also warm interaction with your parents. Or you may give a party this month, inviting both family and friends, for a very genial mix.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>At the same time, action Mars, your ruler, will be in Libra, the most private part of your chart, the twelfth house. This suggests that at work, from now until October 11, you will be in a behind-the-scenes role, mapping out strategy and plans for your company, and at the same time, separately, you may be making plans for yourself and your family.</p>
<p>Your big moment will come when Mars moves into Scorpio next month on October 11 to stay until November 24. At that time, you will experience your most important period of 2023. Mars in your sign will be a great advantage, so it is worth thinking about now what you’d like to start doing then—during that potent period. After Mars leaves Scorpio this year on November 24, Mars will not be back to Scorpio until September 22 to November 4, 2025.</p>
<p>With Mars in Scorpio in mid-October through most of November, you will embark on something new, a perfect time to do so, for your determination to succeed will be very evident, and people will come to you for direction and advice. With Mars in Scorpio, your profile will be high, and others will want to approve your ideas. Your venture will have a superb chance of success, and profits you generate from your new plan will continue to roll in for at least two years, possibly forever.</p>
<p>Mars is your ruler, so while everyone wants to know where Mars is located, its position is more important to you—Mars receives more weight and prominence in a Scorpio’s chart. You have been through many changes recently due to the series of eclipses in Taurus and Scorpio (two signs opposite on the horoscope wheel). Although as a fixed sign you don’t always see the reason for change, there is no doubt change is leading you in the right direction.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>You have only one more eclipse in this family of signs–next month on October 28—and that one will be a very beneficial one for you. After October 28, there will be no more eclipses in the Scorpio-Taurus family of signs for nine years.</p>
<p>Although the month seems to focus mainly on your personal life, your attention will switch back to your work life on the full moon September 29 in Aries, 6 degrees. You appear to be finishing up an important project at that time, and it will be enthusiastically received by others.</p>
<p>Mars, the planet with the biggest role then, will be in close touch with Venus, still touring your prestigious tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement. Venus and Mars go together like coffee with cream, so your popularity and value to others in your company or community will be due for another boost. This is so fortunate! To say you are in line to get heaps of praise for your work is an understatement. Knowing this in advance, pull out all the stops to create the best work you can do.</p>
<p>Keep up your strength, for in the second half of September you will be working on a strenuous yet exciting project. The exciting part is that it will focus you on something new and unfamiliar, so there’s lots to learn. The strenuous part has to do with your need to oversee many details, most likely in concert with a team, and in the process, you may lower your immunity. You are in a powerful period, and you won’t want to be burdened with a cold or the flu. Keep up a nutritious diet, ask your doctor about taking vitamins and whether to get a flu shot, and do your best to get enough sleep. You have an exciting forecast. Stay strong!</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>As the month opens, you are taking love seriously. You want your time with the person you love to count for something, and if you are dating the one you hope to marry, you will be thinking about the various next steps. Hopefully, your partner (or you) will pop the question soon. You are in a thoughtful, reflective mode and may finally discover how your sweetheart feels about the future of your relationship.</p>
<p>If you feel your partner is not marriage material and you want to move on to a new chapter of your life, you may decide to break up. You are now living with a strong sense of purpose, so breaking up would allow you the possibility to meet someone more in tune with your goals and who will support you emotionally.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you have a child, you may be thinking of how best to help him or her, whether by getting him special lessons, helping her make more friends by inviting children over for play dates, or finding ways to protect your child with a secure home if you are in the throes of a divorce.</p>
<p>With Mars in your behind-the-scenes twelfth house, alternatively (or additionally), you may be content to tinker with a creative or entrepreneurial project that is coming to fruition. If this is how the full moon of August 30 (influential until September 4) could affect you, you will have the determination to work hard and polish your project until it gleams.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>Life will become more socially vibrant after the new moon appears on September 14. Friends will invite you to join their events, and you will see your social calendar fill with exciting options. Mercury will finally go direct the day after the new moon, September 15. This is a sure sign that you will feel a blast of energy in the air, and you will be eager to welcome the new season with gusto.</p>
<p>In one of the days that follow, you may be invited to quite a special dress-up party, populated by influential, successful people. Conversation will be intriguing, and people will be warm and welcoming. If you open up and ask advice, one person you meet may have a good idea of how you can go about achieving a long-held dream. It looks as though you will want to cultivate that new friendship.</p>
<p>As you get closer to month’s end, you will be in full swing at the office, working at top speed. It appears you will be looking over the details of an important project. This assignment will likely need to be shipped to the client or your boss within four days of the full moon on September 29. This full moon is well aspected, your client or boss will be pleased and enthusiastic about your effort, so no doubt you’ll be feeling proud—justifiably so.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>This full moon will bring extra kudos to highly original, unique projects, for the full moon will be in Aries, the sign of the inventor. Alternatively, you may be opening the doors to own your own business near month’s end, and if so, you have chosen the right time to do so.</p>
<p>Your sixth house, where the full moon will fall, also rules your health, so it will be imperative that you stay strong and do all you can to avoid colds and the flu. You are being given every opportunity to shine at the office and to expand your social life at the same time. Don’t let illness drag you down—this time is too glorious!</p>
