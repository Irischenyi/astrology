        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>It’s birthday time, and I want you to have the best month ever. September will be a breath of fresh air, after having had two difficult months in July and especially August. Once you get to the second half of September, everything will start to click into place.</p>
<p>As you begin September, you may still be thinking about a relationship which seemed to reach a culmination or end point on the August 30 full moon in Pisces. This full moon lit your seventh house of committed relationships, which includes marriage as well as serious business collaborations and partnerships. One person who has that role in your life is on your mind. All full moons have an area of influence of four to five days, bringing you up to September 4, so sometime between August 30 and September 4 that full moon will deliver its news.</p>
<p>The part that concerns me about this full moon is that it appeared arm-in-arm with Saturn, the planet that forces us to face facts, be practical, and accept what “is” over what we wish could be. That is easier said than done, but you were born with an advantage—you are an earth sign, which makes you naturally clear-eyed and realistic. Those qualities will help you in early September.</p>
<p>One relationship is giving you pause, and I am not sure why. It could be out of compassion, for you may be concerned about the welfare or health of a partner who’s going through a rough time. As a Virgo, you have an admirable ability to keep cool and calm under stress, and that allows you to think about how best to help someone in trouble or when there’s an emergency. This is why Virgos are the ones flown into natural disasters—Virgo can create organization out of pure chaos and bring healing and hope to those who need it most. This a talent others prize in you.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>Alternatively, you may see aspects of a partner’s character that you never noticed before and don’t t like one bit. If it is a romantic partner, this may mark a moment where you’ve come to an end. You’ve tried hard to fix the relationship, but the incident that occurs now may be the last straw. If you are feeling this way about a business partner, agent, accountant, bookkeeper, lawyer, social media director, digital manger, or any other expert you have hired, you will slowly develop a plan to separate and then leave the relationship. Virgo tends not to do things suddenly. You like to plan. You don’t like confrontation, and this episode seems to be no exception.</p>
<p>In either case, you will have to judge whether this is an aberration or if this is part of the personality of your romantic or business partner. If the person is your sweetheart or spouse, was hit with terrible news, and you love each other, then you will want to find a way you can help.</p>
<p>The August 30 full moon will bring Saturn in Pisces tightly opposed to the transiting Sun in Virgo, so it will be very important to keep your own health strong, now and in future months. That aspect involving Saturn can be a very draining. Ask your doctor if you need vitamins.</p>
<p>Venus has spent a lot of time in Leo, your clandestine twelfth house. Venus went into Leo on June 5, went retrograde on July 22, and will turn direct on September 3. Venus will remain in Leo, your twelfth house, until October 8. This is a very long time for Venus to be in one sign, for her normal visit to a sign is one month, not four months!</p>
<blockquote><p>Uranus is based in your ninth house of international travel, so you may be going on a spontaneous international trip, perhaps as a birthday gift from someone who loves you.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>If you have been having a love affair with a person you care for very much but who has not been fully transparent with you, you may find out troubling background facts now. The twelfth house is a secretive house, so you might discover this person is either married or has been cheating on you, which can be too much to bear.</p>
<p>I think the pain of heartbreak can be the most devastating pain of all. I hope you are not subject to this kind of outcome of the full moon of August 30 (influential until September 4). If you do hear news like this, be comforted knowing it’s always better to be dealing with the truth over fiction. You were kept in the dark, you will find out all the facts now. The purpose of a full moon is to shine a spotlight of brilliant daylight on the situation. As they say, daylight is nature’s most potent disinfectant.</p>
<p>This will be a hard full moon for most people. If you were born at the end of August, you will feel it more. Specifically, if you are a reader with a birthday that falls within five days of August 30, you will feel this full moon more directly than other Virgos.</p>
<p>The same is true if you have Virgo rising or your natal moon in Virgo within five degrees of 7 degrees. If you do have such a planetary placement, you, too, will be presented with information of some kind regarding a partner. Look to see if you have a natal planet in Virgo, Pisces, Gemini, or Sagittarius within five degrees of 7 degrees—if so, you will receive news now, too. (This applies if you were born near August 30, February 28, May 30, or November 30.)</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>Almost everyone, however, will find this full moon somewhat tension-producing. Luckily, a full moon will deliver its news, demand a decision, and advance action (even if the action is to take place in the future). It seems to evaporate within days, and then we can move on.</p>
<p>Now you might be wondering how you would know if you have Virgo rising or your natal moon in Virgo and what degrees they are. You can only discover this information if you do your chart. And you can now do your chart—for free—on my Astrologyzone.com website (this isn’t available on my app). You can create as many charts as you want. Just look for “Your Free Natal Chart” above the fold on the front page of Astrologyzone.com.</p>
<p>Your rising sign is just as important as your Sun sign, so you really should read for both to get the full picture. Your rising sign, or ascendant, is the sign that was on the eastern horizon at the moment you were born. Once you have your chart, it will never change.</p>
<p>Now let’s get to the good news. First, Venus, the planet that rules beauty, luxury, love, and fun has been retrograde since July 22 but will go direct on September 3.</p>
<p>If, while Venus was retrograde, you put off dermatological and spa treatments, delayed seeing your salon stylist to ask about a new style or color, or waited to see your cosmetic dentist, you can now make those appointments after September 3. If you are single, I advised you in your August forecast not to have a first date during a weak Venus retrograde, but now you can go out and see if you can find your one truelove.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>Mercury, your ruler, will still be retrograde however, a holdover from August 23, and will go forward in strong direct orbit starting September 15. I always advise you not to sign a contract or accept a new job while Mercury is retrograde, but if you are afraid you will lose the dream apartment or the wonderful job offer if you don’t sign, then all right, sign. You must promise me that you will see a lawyer first and only sign once your lawyer has given you the nod to continue. She may need to make small corrections to be sure you are fully protected. When Mercury is retrograde, having the help of your attorney is essential.</p>
<p>I hope you will put off buying a car, computer, air conditioner, smart phone, or any other mechanical or electronic device you need until after Mercury will be fully direct. Mercury rules the electronic spark in all modern devises as well as all the moving parts in machines. You can shop after September 15.</p>
<p>Ideally, I would like you to hold off on Venus-ruled activities too, like having a first date or changing your appearance, because you are so close to the dazzling new moon in Virgo! Let’s talk about that lovely new moon now, a gift from a loving universe.</p>
<p>The new moon in Virgo, 22 degrees, will occur on Thursday, September 14 (just hours before Mercury goes direct on Friday, September 15). By Monday, September 18, you will be all set to move forward on all your plans and attack them with great energy.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>A new moon in your own sign is a cosmic gift certificate, for you can direct its energy in any way you please. You only get one new moon a year in Virgo, and it always arrives near your birthday.</p>
<p>At the full moon at the end of last month, August 30, the universe spotlighted your partner in love or business, but this new moon on September 14 will turn the tables and put you in touch with your own needs, hopes, and wishes. This new moon is extra sweet and will be capable of fulfilling a desire you are holding in your heart.</p>
<p>If you want something specific to happen, begin working on a way to make it a reality in the days that follow September 14, even if you start with baby steps. This new moon is packed with good news. It will help you to know that although a new moon will be at play and strong for six months, it is extra strong in the 10 days following its initial appearance. That’s when you must act on your desires!</p>
<p>I especially love that Uranus in compatible Taurus will be in perfect position to beam a wonderful surprise. Uranus is based in your ninth house of international travel, so you may be going on a spontaneous international trip, perhaps as a birthday gift from someone who loves you. Pluto will also be at the right place at the right time, sending powerful transformational beams from your romantic fifth house, which also rules children. You might be planning a spontaneous surprise trip for you and your sweetheart or a trip for your children to have fun for a few days before school starts—it would be a gorgeous gesture to create a lasting family memory.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>If your birthday falls on September 14, plus five days, you will strongly notice the benefits of the new moon in Virgo, although all Virgo readers will find a way to find unexpected pleasures and opportunities.</p>
<p>At the new moon September 14, here are other benefits that you might reap from the ninth house aside from travel: Import-export, international relationships, matters involving immigration, citizenship, or residency will also be favored. You may get good news from your lawyer or the court system, alternatively you may like the news you get that is associated with your efforts to get an advanced degree from college or graduate school. The media, including the broadcasting and publishing industries, will be fortunate for you too, and that includes the digital world.</p>
<p>This is not to say everything will be easy for the transiting Sun in Virgo will receive an opposition from Mercury in Pisces at this new moon September 14. The pressure you feel is more likely related to your marriage or business partner. You likely have been feeling this pressure since last March. If you want, you can go to a couple’s therapist—I have heard good things about couples who have done that. And if it’s your business partner, there are therapists that deal in business relationships, just like couple’s therapists.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to the action planet Mars and see what he is doing. Mars will be moving though Libra, a place Mars entered on August 27, and will remain until October 11. During this time, you will be motivated to manage your finances, so you may want to meet with your financial advisor to see how your investments have been doing. You may fill out paperwork for a scholarship or financial aid if you are in college, or a bank loan or venture capital for your business, as some examples.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>Expenses will be running high in September, but it may be because you have not stocked up on many things you need until this month. If you hope to get a new, more prestigious job that would pay you more, you might want to start interviewing selectively soon because I see a solid possibility to land a responsible new, prestigious job at the full moon November 27.</p>
<p>Full moons bring a culmination or ending to activity you started prior to that date, so if you want to make a career move upwards, get started searching for your new position now in mid-September.</p>
<p>Even before that lovely professional full moon appears at the end of November, the October 14 new moon solar eclipse next month might help you find a lucrative new source of income. Eclipses usually ask us to let go of one source in favor of taking advantage of another, more lucrative source. That eclipse will be favorable, so come back next month to find out more—I will give you plenty of detail. New moons are known to start new chapters—this one will focus intently on your way of earning, spending, saving, and paying others, and bring changes for the better.</p>
<p>Speaking of money, you will finish a money arrangement at the beneficial full moon of September 29 in Aries, 6 degrees. You might close on a house, or if you are parting from a marriage, you may settle on the division of property and will likely feel satisfied with the final agreement. Alternatively, you might buy something expensive, like a piece of art or jewelry, or you might sell property, clothing, or jewelry you own for quite a good price.</p>
<p>Next month Venus will be in Virgo starting on October 8, and Mars will enter Scorpio, a compatible sign to yours, on October 11. This tells me you will have a more active social life in October. It will be a fun month.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>This year, 2023, is to be your year to enjoy an adventure. You can travel far and wide for Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, is in a rare visit to Taurus and brightening your ninth house of long-distance travel. Do your best to flee town this month, for you will soon see there are plenty of planets acting like little friends who will want the best for you and will urge you to pack and go and show you reasons why you should listen to them.</p>
<p>You have been working hard under difficult conditions and could use time off if you didn’t take a holiday in May or June, when there were possibilities as well. July and August were challenging for just about everyone.</p>
<p>As you enter September, due to the August 30 full moon, you may be thinking quite a bit about your spouse, boss, father, or a partner/collaborator in business. It may be that this person does not feel well and needs medical attention, and you will do your best to help in any way you can. Alternatively, you may be concerned because you and your partner, in love or business, are not getting along as well as you used to, causing you feelings of loss or anxiety. You may wonder if the relationship may be beyond repair. If your marriage is your focus, you might try couple’s therapy, for it often can bring success to couples who want to stay together. If it&#8217;s a business partner, look for a therapist that specializes in professional relationships.</p>
<p>If the person on your mind in the first days of September is your spouse or a close or important business collaborator, proceed slowly and do not rush to judgment. Mercury is currently retrograde, a holdover from August 23, and Mercury won’t move direct until September 15. During September’s first two weeks while Mercury will still be retrograde, your thought process may be off, and you could make poor decisions.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>Life will improve enormously after the new moon appears on September 14 and Mercury moves forward on September 15. The new moon is in Virgo—the only one of the year—and will create a perfect sparkling golden triangle in the sky.</p>
<p>The Sun and new moon in Virgo will be at the first point of the glittering triangle, the second point will hold surprise-a-minute planet Uranus in Taurus, your travel-oriented ninth house. The triangle’s third point will link to Pluto in Capricorn, and this is the planet of rejuvenation and transformation occupying your fifth house of love and children. The coming two weeks (after September 15) will be yours to enjoy to the fullest—take this rare opportunity to enjoy a romantic getaway.</p>
<p>It looks like a fabulous, spontaneous trip could be in the cards for you, and if you go, it is due to be a happy experience shared with children or with your one-and-only. Spin your compass and choose a city that would require your passport for entry. This month would be ideal to go—the coming months will distract you with other life goals, most likely involving career and money.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>You will be spending more money than usual in September, and in early October another source of money could show up on the new moon solar eclipse October 14.</p>
<p>You likely will send a large check to cover an obligation within five days of the full moon at the end of the month, September 29, but you seem to have known this expense was coming up and are ready to write the check, even if your finances are temporarily tight. A new position with more power and responsibility may come up by the full moon November 27 plus five days. There is no reason to be tense.</p>
<p>Moving forward, your outlook is bright, and if you concerned about drawing from savings and want to replace those funds, you will be able to do so, and you won’t necessarily be set back by the expense. Virgo, you are reported to be careful about money management, so realize there are times you must spend to complete a goal, and there are other times you can save.</p>
