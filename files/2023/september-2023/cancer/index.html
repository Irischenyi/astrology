        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>As you enter the month, you may be in a serious, thoughtful mood. As a Cancer, you are ruled by the moon, so the fact that Saturn is orbiting tightly with the full moon that appeared on August 30 suggests important news reached you or soon will, sometime between September 1 and 4.</p>
<p>Something may be going on overseas. News may involve a foreign business colleague (or person in the home office that’s based abroad), or news may be about a close relative or friend who lives a far distance from you. If the news is personal, involving a beloved relative or friend, you may be concerned about their health or well-being, and you may want to help that person as they go through a rough patch. If, instead, you travel a great distance, you seem to have an important matter to complete, but it won’t be easy to navigate, and you may not entirely get the results you had hoped.</p>
<p>If the circumstance does not have to do with a person at a distance, it may have something to do with your efforts to get an advanced degree at college—or news may be linked someone close to you who is attending a college. Alternatively, legal matters may come to the surface, so you may contact your lawyer to talk about an ongoing case that is reaching a conclusion. One other possible way this full moon could play out would have to do with a publishing or broadcasting piece, possibly made about you or produced by you.</p>
<p>Your ninth house was lit up, and you either heard news immediately on August 30 or soon will, by September 4. The areas I listed all are linked to information coming in or emanating out of specific topics, all linked to the ninth house. I wrote a lot about this full moon in my August forecast, but I will again discuss it here, for this full moon will extend its influence into early September.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>Saturn teaches us that we gain the most pride and feeling of accomplishment from taking on responsibility and working hard. You may get a promotion if you work for a company that has foreign headquarters. Saturn rules your solar seventh house of partnership, so if you are self-employed, you may take on a partner or collaborator—and you both would sign a contract, as the seventh house is mainly a contractual house where a serious promise is made by each party.</p>
<p>If you are dating seriously, you may get or give a marriage proposal or actually wed because the seventh house is also the marriage house. I feel this outcome is less likely, but it is possible. If you were to wed, it seems your partner would have a different religious or ethnic background from yours.</p>
<p>If the news did not emanate from an overseas business associate or bring a need to be concerned about a friend or relative based afar, and you are not getting married, then this full moon might bring a meeting with officials about an immigration/visa/passport/residency matter. The full moon, alternatively, may have centered you on a conclusion regarding your participation as a student in college or university.</p>
<p>Is none of the above resonating with you? If you work in the media, you may have wrapped up a big project in publishing or broadcasting that had a weighty news value. If you have legal case pending, you may get the jury’s verdict, hear a judge’s decision, or, having avoided a trial by doing arbitration, are now getting the answer from the arbitrator.</p>

        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>Saturn condenses and shrinks what it touches, so it could be a somber moment because Saturn forces us all to be practical and realistic, teaching us to deal with what “is” rather than what we dearly wish things to be.</p>
<p>This full moon was in Pisces, a water sign, so you do have to be concerned about flooding or water damage. Neptune, Pisces’ ruler, is traveling in Pisces. Neptune is playing a leadership role in this full moon and is well aspected. Neptune will send shimmering vibrations to both Uranus in Taurus and Pluto in Capricorn. This suggests a happy result from this full moon, so stay optimistic. You may see an unexpected twist to this episode, for that’s what Uranus would do when in a supportive, affirming angle. The surprise help would emanate from one of your friends (or a community you belong to) because Uranus is in your eleventh house of friendships and groups.</p>
<p>If you were born on June 28, plus or minus five days, even though Saturn is involved, you will likely benefit from this full moon. The full moon on August 30 was, and will continue to be until September 4, exactly trine your Sun—a supremely harmonious aspect. Having Saturn in a water sign—Pisces—is another huge plus.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to Mars, which just moved into Libra on August 27 for the first time in two years and will remain in Libra to brighten your home and family sector until October 11. Mars will give you an advantage during those weeks to find housing or to improve the house or apartment you live in now. It will help you buy or sell property, if that’s your aim. You can now buy beautiful new furniture, paint, make repairs, put in new windows to replace the old ones, or even work on the landscaping of your property.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>This same sector rules family members too, so if your parent or grown child need your assistance, you can find an answer. This will be a highly productive period for home and family-related questions and goals.</p>
<p>Also, the year’s eclipses are moving to Aries and Libra, away from Taurus and Scorpio, and this will help you with home and family matters. The next eclipse will arrive as a new moon solar eclipse in Libra on October 14, and it will help you in a big way. Ironically, it comes just as Mars is leaving your home and family sector October 11. Start planning now, and you will be ready at next month’s eclipse to see your plans click into place.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the sugar and spice new moon of September 14 in Virgo, 22 degrees, which will light your third house of quick, short travel. This is a friendly new moon, so in the weeks ahead, you might opt for one or two weekend getaways. Uranus in your friendship house will signal the Sun and new moon, so you may be traveling to see a friend and stay at your friend’s weekend cottage. If you want to take a little nearby vacation, this new moon will make it a wonderful time to go. The third house also rules siblings, so you may be traveling with your sibling or visiting your sister or brother.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you might also decide to have face-to-face meetings with clients based not too far from your office. The third house is a contractual house, so if you hope to sign a contract, this new moon, September 14, arrives just one day prior to the date that Mercury will move out of retrograde. Perfect! Deals you have been working on can now click into place.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>Keep in mind that a new moon is in effect for six months, but its influence will be strongest in the 10 days that follow its first appearance (September 14).</p>
<p>I feel this new moon is one of the best of the year for you. A golden triangle will appear with the Sun and new moon in Virgo as the first point, receiving shimmering rays from Pluto in Capricorn, your solar partnership/marriage sector, from the second point. Pluto is in your partnership house but so close to your financial eighth house that Pluto may bring help from both a spouse or a business partner and also good financial news—it appears you may receive a considerable sum of money in the days that follow September 14. At the same time, Uranus in Taurus will be tightly beaming the new moon as the third point of this golden triangle, so again, you will encounter positive twists, turns, and surprises to the plot that in the end you’ll love.</p>
<p>Saturn will oppose Mercury at the September 14 new moon, so if you do travel, make sure your car is in top working order. Have your car checked by your mechanic before starting out. Make sure you have the correct address, especially if there are two companies with the same name in the same city (such as a hotel name). Don’t drive if the distance is far—you may be asking too much of yourself. The idea is to relax, not exhaust yourself. You can always fly and take Ubers or a rental car at your destination.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to the exciting full moon of September 29 in Aries at 6 degrees. This full moon will be shining at the very pinnacle of your chart, your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement. This full moon is due to give your career a big boost. Jupiter in Taurus will send greetings to this full moon, as will Pluto in late degrees of Capricorn. This full moon is capable of giving you a promotion or news that you are the choice for a top position in another firm where you’ve been interviewing. With Neptune so close to the full moon, your photo may be in the newspaper, or you may receive an award for your creative approach to work on a specific project.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>Aries is the sign of the entrepreneur, so you may be opening the doors to your new business this week, or you may already have your own business. Either way, it looks like you may bring in a big client this week.</p>
<p>Mars will have an important role to play at the full moon September 29, and fortunately, Mars will be in harmonious position to his lover Venus, a planet associated with financial gain (among other things). Venus will be orbiting in its newly strong position, having turned direct on September 3 in your second house of earned income. This suggests that you have an excellent chance of seeing an uptick in income at the time the full moon of September 29 appears.</p>
<p>If you are selling your home, renting out your home (such as with Airbnb or to a location scout for a movie), adding a roommate to share the rent, or getting a tenant for your two-family home, this activity could be another source of income to you.</p>
<p>It’s a busy month, filled with opportunity. I feel you will like September very much, especially from the second half onward.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>It seems as though you want to travel before the seasons change, and with crowds thinning out, this will be the ideal time for you to pack and go. The full moon of August 30 in Pisces will still be exerting its presence in the first four days of September, and you may go to a place near water that will require your passport for entry. You might drive just over the border or to a city much farther away, but either way, the trip will likely only encompass a few days.</p>
<p>Saturn will be orbiting close to this full moon of August 30, so you seem to have an important goal to complete. You may hear from a colleague who is based overseas or from a relative or friend who is dear to you and based at a distance that might need your sympathetic response. In fact, you may plan to see that person. Saturn’s strong presence suggests a serious tone to this full moon.</p>
<p>Watch weather reports and listen to authorities if the area you will be visiting (or live in) has the possibility of flooding. You could be dealing with a lot of water as you enter September for the August 30 full moon is a full moon in watery Pisces.</p>
<p>There are various ways this full moon could deliver its news, not exclusively linked to travel. You may see a legal case finish up, be the subject of a serious media story (or be the person producing it), or enroll in college or graduate school. It is also possible you will marry someone who has a very different background from yours.</p>
<p>In the first four days of September, you will hear the news, and you will need to remain rational, objective, and practical.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>You will have a strong emphasis on home and family because Mars, the action planet, will be bringing a lot of activity to this part of your life. At some point in September, you may be traveling to see a family member, to view real estate to decide about a possible deal, or to simply spend quality time with your children, or (if they’re younger) perhaps you may be designing a fun end-of-summer experience for them.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may be working on improving and refreshing the beauty of your physical home, and you may even decide to make an official home office, beautifully outfitted with everything you need to do your work efficiently and comfortably. This is the first time Mars is putting an emphasis on this private side of life in two years—this emphasis started August 27 will continue until October 11.</p>
<p>If you have a business deal to complete, keep in mind that Mercury will be retrograde, a holdover from last month, until September 15. If you are getting ready to make a legal agreement, do so AFTER that date</p>
<p>If you cannot wait for fear of losing the job offer, the dream apartment, or something else, then sign, but have a lawyer look over the paperwork first, and have an exit clause built in. It’s not a good time to sign, but sometimes we can’t control everything in life. You can always make more changes up ahead if this opportunity turns out not to suit you.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>Now let’s turn to the new moon that will arrive mid-month. You may be on the road again after the new moon in Virgo of September 14 arrives, and it would likely be a destination closer to home, however Saturn will oppose Mercury, so travel may only be possible for a very few days. If you plan on driving, have your car checked out and tuned up ahead of time. Fortunately, Mercury will go direct September 15, and Mercury is the planet of transportation, travel, and communication, including contracts. If you do travel a short distance, you seem to have a matter that you need to work on in a collaborative way, ideally face-to-face.</p>
<p>Due to Saturn’s opposition to Mercury, you may need to sift through all you’ve been told in order to find the truth regarding a puzzling matter, and doing so might not be easy. Neptune is not helping because Neptune will directly oppose the Sun and new moon, clouding information, and forcing you to do research and background checks before moving forward.</p>
<p>There is one exception—if you are working on a creative project collaboratively, this is a perfect time to do so. It’s just not a good time to work on facts and figures. Even in a creative project, aim for clear communication with plenty of time to summarize what you heard to be sure you both are on the same page.</p>
<p>Keep you spirts up because at the same time you will have outstanding support from genius Uranus and big-money planet Pluto, quite a team of heavy hitters. Your friends and your spouse could be quite helpful in any deal you are trying to forge or project you are working through. They can help you sort out facts to look at closely and come up with possible answers. You will also want to consult your lawyer or an expert collaborator at the office. Like the saying goes, two heads are better than one, but in your case, many more heads can be even better to ferret out complexities. Pluto’s position suggests you will see a large sum of money at this time.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>With all this going on, you may only be able to squeeze out a little time for yourself, most likely to take a long weekend in a beautiful mountainous region. Even a few days away might be welcome, considering all you have to do in September.</p>
<p>As the month nears its end, you may get to your very favorite part—the full moon of September 29 will light the highest point in your chart, your tenth house of career honors, awards, and achievement, bringing you an exciting moment of praise and honors—you may get a new professional title, a promotion, or award, or be the focus of a feature story in the press. Neptune will be conjunct the full moon, so your photograph may be in the press, along with a story, for all the world to see. It could be an exciting high point on a mainly lovely moment.</p>
