        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>You are starting September on a very lyrical note. Mars is now in Libra, having first entered for the first time in two years late last month on August 27, putting you in the role of leader of the parade. Having Mars in Libra is a major advantage, for Mars will give you presence, warmth, courage, determination, and a will to succeed professionally. On a social level, Mars can also make you more attractive, confident, and magnetic. Others will be drawn to you, rally around your ideas, and follow you wherever you go.</p>
<p>In matters of romance, you will find it is easier to meet new people, and as a result, your social life should now start to expand. If you ever felt a little invisible (we all do from time to time), you won’t feel that way with Mars in your sign. You will have this lovely privilege of Mars in Libra from now until October 11.</p>
<p>There is more good news. If you found recent months a bit weird and unproductive, it is because Venus has been retrograde since July 22. But she will go direct September 3. Venus rules Libra and also governs many of the enjoyable parts of life: beauty and good looks, the cultural arts and music, luxury and romance, and pure fun. I had advised you that during Venus retrograde you should avoid making any effort to dramatically improve your looks, such as visiting your dermatologist for fillers or Botox or seeing your cosmetic dentist about veneers or orthodontic work, and to put off visiting your salon stylist to get ideas for a dramatically different haircut or color. (To be clear, regular grooming was fine to do, such as hair trim. The key was not to make dramatically different changes.)</p>
<p>Venus also rules high-priced gems like diamonds and sapphires, and I said to wait until Venus goes direct if you are in the market for expensive jewelry. Venus rules luxury, so if you refrained from going to a luxury spa or booking time in a multi-star hotel, you were right to wait.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>I had asked you not to have a first date during Venus retrograde either because first meetings either don’t go well or else cool off quickly, leaving you wondering what happened.</p>
<p>Now Venus will go direct on September 3, and happily, Venus will be in Leo, a sign that blends beautifully with yours. Having your ruling plant moving assertively direct will make all the difference to your spirit, energy, and productivity in coming days. Venus only retrogrades every 18 months, so you have an open road with blue skies and sunshine, free of road blocks.</p>
<p>I will admit that Mercury is still retrograde, however, and this particular Mercury retrograde period has been tough on everyone, for Mercury has been in Virgo, the sign it rules. That means this retrograde is stronger than usual, making the haywire effects that so often occur during a Mercury retrograde period more frustrating. If you felt like you were on a hamster wheel going around and around but getting nowhere fast, that’s understandable. (You see now that having Venus AND Mercury retrograde was a double whammy, the reason why you might have been feeling frustrated.)</p>
<blockquote><p>Your finances are looking up, and you may get a surprise influx of money—if you have not yet discovered you are a money magnet this year, you soon will.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>Whenever Mercury retrogrades, I always ask you not to sign agreements, if possible, and to wait, but some readers wrote saying they were worried that they would lose an opportunity if they didn’t sign. If, for example, you would lose the dream apartment or perfect job, then you have to sign the contract.</p>
<p>I hope you have made it a habit to always consult your lawyer at the time you need to sign papers. And when Mercury is retrograde, it becomes ever more vital that you do. Mercury will continue to retrograde until September 15, so communication will continue to become fogged, and it would be all too easy to sign papers with clauses that are unfavorable to you or that could even put you in jeopardy.</p>
<p>It is also never wise to buy electronics during these periods—Mercury rules the moving parts in all machines, including the electronic chips that create the spark. If an electronic item is going to show wear and tear, it will usually do so during a Mercury retrograde period. My computer printer just died. I will wait to buy a new one until after Mercury goes direct on September 15. (Luckily, I have spare printer, but I always like to have two of everything that I use every day—I will get a new printer later this month.)</p>
<p>We are close to Mercury moving direct, and I would suggest you wait the few extra days—until the second half of the month—before resuming anything you had hoped to do, even though Venus is turning direct September 3. I would like to see both planets moving in forward direction. Venus and Mercury both orbit close to earth, so their influence is strong. Wait, if you can, until after September 15 to resume normal activities. If you need elective surgery, and there is no downside to waiting, then wait, but if the surgery is urgent, do it immediately.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>Now let’s talk about the full moon that arrived last month on August 30 in Pisces, 7 degrees. This full moon arrived orbiting close to Saturn, the planet that teaches us life lessons and the value of dealing with life’s events in a realistic and practical way. That full moon arrived August 30 and will have an area of influence that will extend to September 4. It fell in your sixth house of work-a-day projects, the people you interact with at work, the tools your use, and the place where you work, with an emphasis on team members and subordinates, but not VIPs.</p>
<p>This full moon was conjunct Saturn. Sometimes Saturn conjunct a full moon is good—you make a commitment that you are ready to make, and you will stick to your promise—the matter will have great longevity. Other times, we pay a price for a mistake we made or are criticized for an action we took, but in any case, it seems the misstep is fixable. You can acknowledge the error and show regret, but also confidence that you can do better. As you enter September you may still be thinking about the news it brought and how you would like to respond to any question it might have brought up.</p>
<p>This same house rules your health and all the steps you take to stay healthy. It looks like a creative or complex project was finishing up, and because you spent a lot of time on it, you may feel unusually low in energy and in need of sleep. That’s a common feeling with a full moon in the sixth house, so give in to it.</p>
<p>Neptune was a key planet at the August 30 full moon, and happily, Uranus, the planet of surprise, reached out to Neptune in a very supportive way. Uranus is in your financial house, so in the first week of September, you may get a check from someone, or even the government, that you didn’t expect but that you surely will be happy to receive.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the new moon of September 14 in Virgo at 22 degrees. It holds a number of treasures, benefits, and opportunities for you.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>Your twelfth house will be emphasized, a house that rules privacy and enormous creativity that stems directly to your subconscious. If you are artistic or are paid for your creative ideas, AFTER the new moon of September 14 arrives, find a way to take time alone, away from the cacophony of voices and opinions of others to come up with ideas and expressions for a specific project. It could be a personal project or one for a client, but working alone, you will soon find the ideas you generate will be entirely yours. I feel everyone is creative—just have faith that you can turn out something wonderful.</p>
<p>The transiting Sun and new moon moving through your twelfth house will also strongly boost your intuitive powers, so it will be important to listen to that small voice within—it will be there to help you make the right decisions. You may even have a dream that seems odd, but you should take seriously.</p>
<p>I will give you an example of how a dream helped me in a tangible way. Last year, in late September 2022, I had a dream that I was at my bank, signing papers with the branch manager about identity theft. I never dream about my bank, so when I woke up, I thought it was very odd. I forgot about it, because phones were ringing, and I was also deep in writing your Astrology Zone forecast for October. By evening I thought about the dream again, so I checked my bank’s app. Listed among checks I had written was a huge check coming through that I knew I had not written (luckily, it was marked “pending”). It was made out to a person I didn’t know and never heard of.</p>
<p>The next morning, I visited my bank’s branch manager, and in a strange recreation of déjà vu, there I was, at my bank, signing papers with the branch manager about my identify theft. The branch manager shut down my account immediately, and I ordered new checks. He agreed that although my signature looked similar, the check itself didn’t look anything like my checks. The thief must have had access to one of my checks in one way or another, which is how he had copied my signature, but did a botched-up job trying to mimic the actual check. The moral of the story: Take your dreams seriously. They are often there to help you.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>Your twelfth house, being accented on September 14 and for weeks ahead, also rules confinement, privacy, and rest as well as hospitals, rehab centers, physical therapy centers, and other places of healing, so that will be a good time to reach out to a doctor if you feel the need.</p>
<p>You may interact with medical personnel in the second half of September, either for yourself or on behalf of a friend or relative. Indeed, it is a good time to attend to physical or psychological matters this month. You are getting ready for your new birthday year, and you will want to enter it in top shape. If a family member is dealing with a medical matter, you may help by contributing your cheer and also to be your loved one’s medical advocate (every patient needs one).</p>
<p>Make appointments for your own annual medical checkup, routine screenings, blood tests, and blood pressure reading. Neptune is active this month, so if tests don’t add up or bring a solid diagnosis, get a second opinion. Also, see your eye doctor and dentist. If you want to see a therapist to give up a substance that is hurting your health or to get a new perspective on any psychological matter, after the new moon is the time to do it. You’ll have very encouraging planets, and I would like you to take advantage of them.</p>
<p>There is another way you can use this September 14 new moon. The twelfth house also rules secrets, and if anyone tried to withhold information from you, the new moon would bring that secret up to the surface like a geyser during the second half of September. This includes things going on behind the scenes—any information being held by a co-worker, colleague, business partner, collaborator, or the management, a secret of a friend or member of your family, or actions of a sweetheart or spouse. Anything that the universe feels you should know about will be presented to you.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>I don’t want you to worry—if there are no hidden secrets, you will not feel this interpretation. If there is a piece of information that you need to know, it will likely come out this month, and it seems to be work-related. It will take time and effort to get to the bottom of the mystery because this new moon is ruled by Mercury, and Saturn is found in direct opposition to Mercury. That doesn’t mean you can’t find out—only that it will take patience and subtle, discrete probing.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to another subject—your partner in love. Your spouse, the person you are serious about, or your sweetheart or person in a long-term, established loving and committed relationship will be on your mind at the full moon in Aries on September 29.</p>
<p>This full moon of September 29 will appear in your seventh house of committed, serious partnerships, usually sealed with contractual agreement (a verbal/unwritten agreement is just as binding in astrology as a written contract). This house usually points to your spouse or person you want to marry eventually. It also covers business relationships, such as a business partner, expert collaborator, agent, or other self-employed person you bring in for their expertise. While this house does rule these business-based relationships, I feel you are more likely to feel it in a personal, romantic relationship.</p>
<p>The news should be welcome and heartwarming. Mars will be the standout planet, and Mars will contact Venus in a most loving way. Venus will still be in Leo, a sign highly compatible to your Libra Sun. Venus is currently based in your eleventh house of hopes and wishes, a house capable of bringing pure joy. In fact, something you were hoping and wishing to happen—something so personal to you, held in your heart, that I cannot see what that might be in the chart—could materialize near September 29.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>As a side bonus to this full moon, you may get good news concerning your career progress or praise for work well done recently. You may also receive a check you never expected. It’s all good!</p>
<p>You may attend a happy social event or hear good news from your partner. Keep in mind that a lovely well-placed Venus communicating in a friendly way to Mars would always be an especially good sign for you. Venus is you ruler, so although everyone will like this full moon, having Venus so well positioned means this full moon will be even more positive for you than for most others.</p>
<p>One other planet will be friendly at this full moon—Pluto, from your fourth house of home and family. You may get a financial gift or special help from a family member, most likely from your mother or father or someone you would think of as a parent. You may, alternatively, get good news about a mortgage being approved from the bank for you.</p>
<p>If you are a September-born Libra, from September 24 to October 4, you will get a double dip of pleasure from this September 29 full moon. But no matter when your birthday is, every Libra should have something to cheer about. You will like the month of September, especially from September 15 onward.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Life is getting better and better and, thanks to Jupiter, will be even more so in the second half of 2024 and beyond. I know that seems like a long way away, but it will be here sooner than you think. You have just come through two tough months (July and August), but things are changing for the better. The planets are becoming more congenial, and some of the challenges of 2023 are starting to simmer down.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>Venus, your ruler, has been in a lackadaisical, lazy retrograde since July 22, so your efforts to make progress on almost any front were thwarted and caused you to be puzzled and frustrated. Venus will go direct on September 3, and from then on you can do all the things I had warned you not to do while Venus was retrograde. Specifically, you can see your dermatologist and have procedures done or call your dentist for cosmetic surgery. You can try a new expensive skin care line, have your hair cut or colored in a dramatic new way, spend for expensive items, like a piece of art or tickets to a concert or opera, or splurge on a long weekend at a luxury hotel.</p>
<p>Best of all, once Venus goes direct September 3 you can start to have first dates again. I had warned that dating someone new when Venus is retrograde is never wise. Venus rules the spark of love, including the warmth, affection and even excitement of meeting someone new who seems to have a lot in common with you. However, if your first date happens when Venus is retrograde, that budding relationship can fall flat soon after. (If you went back to someone you used to know, then Venus retrograde would not affect you negatively—you started the relationship a long time ago.)</p>
<p>Mercury is still retrograde in Virgo as you start September, and Mercury will regulate its orbit too, on September 15, the day after an encouraging new moon in Virgo on September 14. Wait to make your biggest initiations until after September 15 if you can. We cannot control everything in life, and if you have a medical emergency or are afraid you would lose the chance to get the lease to the apartment or the shot at the job if you didn’t sign the contract presented, then do sign. Be sure you have a lawyer look at the contract before you put your name on the dotted line, and make sure you have an exit clause in case you change your mind about the commitment later after you are in the situation.</p>
<p>As you enter September you will be busy finishing a big project. It may have been completed either at the end of August, at the full moon August 30, or will be, at the latest by September 4. This project appears to have taken a great deal of your energy, for Saturn orbited close to the August 30 full moon and shows that your recent assignment was arduous.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>It appears you truly needed all hands on deck, but your company may have been streamlining staff and not hiring anyone new, a possible reason so much work fell to your shoulders. Or you may not have had enough help simply due to staff vacations. If you did have staff at their desks, they may have been a little cranky or distracted because they were wishing they were on vacation—not at work. Oh goodness! No wonder so much was put on you to get things done.</p>
<p>Still, you have some wonderful planets on your side. Mercury’s big brother Mars, the energy planet, just entered Libra last month on August 27 for the first time in two years and will stay until October 11. This is great news. Having Mars in your sign is a great privilege that happens for approximately six weeks every two years. Mars in Libra suggests you are setting off on a new venture or exciting relationship, and your plans will be further boosted by the positive, helpful new moon of September 14.</p>
<p>You will command attention with Mars in Libra, so if you ever felt a little invisible, that won’t be the case now. Mars is known to add to your attractiveness, and your profile will rise. At work, your passion for all you believe in will rally others to your side. The seeds you plant now will carry you forward for two years and pay you dividends along the way. It’s a special period, so take it seriously—in many ways, right now you are at the front of the class, the leader of the parade, and the one everyone wants to get to know, support, and follow.,</p>
<p>The recent eclipses in April and May seem to have made you more determined to make money from a new source, and it appears by now you’ve found it. If you say you haven’t, keep looking, as you can and will find a new source soon.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>The new moon on September 14 in Virgo will give you a needed break. Mid-month will be a time of quiet reflection and planning. You won’t want a heavy social schedule, so take a break and hibernate for a week—do this after the new moon in Virgo appears on September 14</p>
<p>Life will go better in the second half of the month because Mercury will finally be moving in direct orbit, and you will feel the tempo of life pick up noticeably. Neptune will oppose the Sun and new moon, clouding facts, so take a week to think through a plan and to do research before announcing a big decision. Your mood will be buoyant and optimistic, even though you are expressing these feelings in a subtle, quiet way. This new moon will be energizing your creativity, so spend time alone, and work on your craft.</p>
<p>By the way, your finances are looking up, and you may get a surprise influx of money—if you have not yet discovered you are a money magnet this year, you soon will.</p>
<p>Your spouse, steady sweetheart, or alternatively, your business partner, agent, lawyer, or other close collaborator will have important news to share with you at the full moon September 29 (plus five days). It’s due to be exciting news that will affect you positively too, simply because you both are so close. Mars will be in charge of that full moon, and Mars in Libra is in close contact with Venus. Mars and Venus go together like cup and saucer—better together, always, and Venus is associated not only with love and beauty but also money.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>Your family may be on your mind too, and again, your clan seems solidly in step with your goals and decisions. If you need help from a family member, ask—chances are you will get it. You may not even have to ask—a parent may send you a generous, surprise check for your birthday, which you will be very grateful to get.</p>
<p>Additionally, at this full moon you may also hear good news about a career breakthrough. So as you see, the September 29 full moon is full of surprises and happy circumstances.</p>
