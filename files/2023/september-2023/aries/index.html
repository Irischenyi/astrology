        <p>September should be a better month than August, for last month you likely encountered many frustrations due to both Venus and Mercury retrograde, which slowed your progress. Venus has been napping since July 22. Venus’ impending move direct will improve your efforts to have more love and fun and to improve your looks, and that will happen September 3.</p>
<p>Still, I would wait a few days beyond then before diving into your social life and making changes to your looks. You have been dealing with the frustrations of Mercury retrograde since August 23, but you began to feel the haywire effects earlier, and those were noticeable mainly in regard to your routine, daily work-a-day activities. (Because Mercury has been traveling in Virgo, a sign it rules, this retrograde period was stronger than most. Also, it’s been stuck in your work-office environment sixth house.) If you feel like you’ve been trying to walk through glue, not making the kind of progress you would normally expect, you can blame Mercury retrograde in Virgo. Mercury will turn direct September 15.</p>
<p>Until you reach September 15, you won’t see a change. During the first half of September, avoid making a major product launch, purchasing an expensive item, or closing on a house, as three examples. Mercury is very strong these days because Mercury is traveling in Virgo, a sign Mercury rules. You may read about Mercury’s lagging effect for two to three weeks AFTER it goes direct, but after doing research over years, I have never seen any after effect. In fact, I see a blast of energy come through my window. I would say to wait only a few days after September 15 to allow Mercury to stabilize, but you need not wait additional weeks.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>Now let’s turn to the recent full moon which occurred August 30 in Pisces, your twelfth house. I wrote about this full moon last month in your August forecast because it concerned me a bit. That full moon orbited close to Saturn (conjunct) and opposed the transiting Sun in Virgo, and you may still be feeling this full moon’s effects from when you enter September through September 4. Demands between the needs of work and at home will be strong, and you may feel tension. The moon is often a prominent woman in your life, and in astrology we start with “mother” in the pecking order, so give her a call to see how she is doing.</p>
<p>Not helping is Neptune opposed to retrograde Mercury and Mars, making this period of Mercury retrograde even more confusing than necessary. Facts will be hard to come by at the very start of September. Money will roll in, though, so use it to hire help if you feel you need an extra pair of hands.</p>
<p>A full moon in the solar twelfth house (as you have August 30, influential until September 4) can bring on a feeling of exhaustion, so make it a point to take it easy. The moon always is associated with the domestic condition too, so you will be feeling the need to attend to events happening at home, even though work-related tasks will be pressing on you as you enter September. Break things up into small tasks, and ask for help. Also, do all you can to bolster your health. Stay practical and face any situation presented squarely. If you are criticized, it won’t be the end of the world. Accept it, be confident and plan to do better. Saturn might bring feedback, but it is only meant to improve your performance, so be glad for it.</p>
<blockquote><p>The good aspects from September 14 to 20 will spill forth like a plethora of sparkling emeralds, diamonds, rubies, and sapphires from heaven.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>This full moon August 30 is at 7 degrees Pisces, so I don’t know if it will be in hard angle to one of your natal planets or not—there is always the possibility this full moon will be friendly. You can now do your birth chart with my new feature on my website. Near the top of the homepage, look for the headline, “Free Natal Birth Chart.” This feature is not on my app, only my Internet site—it’s “above the fold” under my banner, and you can do your chart for free as often as you like.</p>
<p>If you do your chart, look for any planet you might have at 7 degrees (plus or minus five degrees, spanning 2 to 12 degrees) in Virgo, Sagittarius, Gemini, or Pisces—if you have one planet that fits this category, you will feel this full moon’s tension. The full moon could have a favorable outcome if you have a natal planet in Pisces, Cancer, Scorpio, Taurus, Virgo, or Capricorn at 7 degrees (plus or minus five degrees). At any rare, you will find out by watching your life in the first week of September.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you will feel better after September 4 (the range of the full moon) and even better after September 15 when Mercury goes direct. In the meantime, with a full moon in Pisces conjunct Saturn, the planet of the lessons we learn in life, be careful with or near water in September’s first week—flooding, unsafe drinking water, swimming in rough water or rip tides, and so forth. Stress safety in swimming pools.</p>
<p>A sparkly day will arrive on Friday, September 8, when the Sun and Jupiter will be in ideal sync. This is a four-star day—especially for your earned income! News should be very welcome. Circle this day in gold on your calendar. Use it for an important job interview or a sales presentation (or proposal). Your work at the office will start to become easier and smoother even though you are still a week away from Mercury going direct. You have a chance to get organized and ready for the over-the-top busy period that is coming.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>Mars, your ruler, is in Libra, so you will be doing quite a bit of collaboration with others at work, perhaps with key experts you have hired, such as your accountant, lawyer, social media director, agent, or publicist, as some examples. If you are married or dating seriously, you may be focused on your partner.</p>
<p>If you are married, your mate will likely be making headline news in your life. If you have a serious sweetheart, you might be getting ready to become engaged or married soon and be consumed with preparations. If you are not romantically involved, you may be working closely with one or two high-level executives in your firm to polish up a project. Aries usually likes to be in charge, but you may not mind being a team member in September because your staff will be congenial, and the team’s ideas and advice will seem sound.</p>
<p>The new moon of September 14 in Virgo at 22 degrees will occur one day prior to the move of Mercury to direct on September 15. This is great. All the tasks and projects you’ve been working on in the office leading to this point will begin to pay off. The change will be welcome and quite dramatic. I feel this new moon will change the nature of your tasks—something is moving into a more sophisticated, fast-paced schedule. It will be far more fascinating than the work you did over July and August, and it will put you on a more visible level. A new moon is not for “just a day.” See it as a door you walk through that will affect you for six months, although it is strongest in the 10 days that follow its appearance.</p>
<p>This lovely new moon will bring on a rush of activity. It creates a supremely beneficial golden triangle in the heavens—the Sun and moon in Virgo in your work-a-day house will reach out in a fantastic way to Pluto in Capricorn in your house of honors, awards, and achievement, giving you kudos for all you’ve been doing. This may surprise you because over the past weeks, you felt you were pushing a boulder up a steep mountain. You thought no one noticed, but you will soon see that they were, admiring what you did, so all that foundational work you put into your career is starting to add up to something big.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>At the same time, the Sun and new moon in Virgo on September 14 will reach out to Jupiter in your second house of earned income. Money will start to roll in—save some of it. Money you receive will be generous, but alas, your outlook can’t always be THIS special for earning money. You will have a long run, however, through most of May 2024. This could be life changing, for it is likely you will continue to cruise on to a new, higher income level.</p>
<p>See what is happening here: You have Uranus in Taurus, Jupiter in Taurus, and Pluto in Capricorn all in perfect angle to the Sun and new moon, which will be conjoined in Virgo, the reason why I feel you have such an open road to score big mid-month and in weeks to follow.</p>
<p>Typically, money goes up and down in life. Some years we earn a lot, but even when we do, we sometimes have big expenses, so although we make a good living, it may not feel that way. Save some of your bounty, and let it work for you. Have it multiplied while you sleep by consulting a successful financial advisor.</p>
<p>If money is not good now, you have many months to see this generous trend materialize, so keep working on your plan. Put aside some money for taxes, for when you grow into a new income level, the tax rates change, and you may be surprised by the taxes you will owe. (This all falls in the category of good problems to have.) You are in a glorious period of transition, and I am sure you will enjoy the outcome.</p>
<p>As you move through the month, I love the days (actually a week) of September 14 to 20. There will be so many good aspects during those days that they will spill forth like a plethora of sparkling emeralds, diamonds, rubies, and sapphires from heaven. It is the perfect time to start something new, and you will feel the heightened energy from the very start. At long last, no more waiting for a propitious time to launch a product, service, or romantic relationship.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>The new moon will open the door on September 14. On September 15, Mercury goes direct, and on the same day, the Sun is in lovely angle to Uranus, bringing a positive financial surprise. On September 19, the Sun will partner with Neptune, bringing fresh ideas for a creative project. (Just avoid signing papers on September 19.) On Wednesday, September 20, the Sun will be in divine angle to Pluto, an excellent day to make decisions on financial and estate planning. Keep in mind that there is a spill-over effect on all these days, affecting the days prior and after they occur and spreading lots of good cheer.</p>
<p>This month has, in effect, two full moons, and the second one will arrive on September 29 in Aries at 6 degrees. Something of enormous importance to you will come to a culmination and conclusion at this full moon. Uranus will trine Mercury, which rules contractual matters. Travel and your everyday work efforts will go well at this time of the month, for this is a protective, encouraging aspect that could bring you financial gain or praise. Mars will take the lead at this full moon, and happily, Mars in Libra will reach out to Venus in Leo (by this point in the month, Venus will be moving direct in strong orbit). An ongoing or new relationship is apt to go very well.</p>
<p>If your birthday falls on March 30, plus or minus four days, you will feel this full moon directly. The same is true if you have a natal planet, the Sun, or moon at 6 degrees, plus or minus five degrees, in Aries, Leo, Sagittarius, Gemini, Libra, or Aquarius—that planet and house of your horoscope will light up and be helpful to you.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You may have been unusually busy last month—August—so as you enter September, you will be in need of rest and rejuvenation. New and evolving responsibilities are pressing on you, and at the full moon August 30 (still quite influential until 4), you might feel overwhelmed and wonder if you have bitten off too much. Rest assured, you have not. You can handle all that comes your way as long as you get rest after going through a particularly strenuous period.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>This feeling of being given too much to do in too little time is temporary—you will feel more in control soon. Saturn, called the teacher-taskmaster planet, will be the culprit here.</p>
<p>Home and family seem to be a big focus. You may be looking for a new place to live or renovating. Or it may be that daily responsibilities, such as taking care of your children while running your household, and feeling strong career demands, is a lot to handle. Or you may be concerned about the welfare of your mother or other female relative, due to Saturn’s conjunction of the moon. (The moon is read as female in a chart.)</p>
<p>Fortunately, your ability to make good money will remain strong, and if you have not seen evidence of this yet, you soon will. (Aries is never shy about speaking up for good compensation, which will work in your favor.) Having a good income will give you the means to hire help when you need it most.</p>
<p>You may be feeling financially cautious—the first full moon (which actually fell August 30) was a thrifty moon—and although that is admirable, this month you really do need an extra pair of hands, so don’t think twice about hiring help. There are times in our lives that we can save and other times when we are forced to spend, and you must not feel bad about doing so now.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the month will initially move slowly until Venus and Mercury, both retrograde as the month opens, go direct. Venus will turn direct September 3, and Mercury will go direct on September 15. Always allow a few days after the date a planet normalizes its orbit before putting your plans in place. Venus is in charge of love, romance, beauty, luxury, and fun, but when she is retrograde, her powers diminish. Perhaps you put off seeing your dermatologist for treatments, and if so, you were wise to refrain from making the appointment. You can now start calling for an appointment again, but you might want to wait until after Mercury is done being retrograde, which is September 15, to make any changes in your appearance.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>Mercury started to retrograde August 23, and during the three and a half weeks that Mercury is out of phase you may be tempted to rush, not pay close attention to details, become forgetful, and not make solid, well-considered decisions. Mercury also rules the gears and electronic chips in machines, so if you want to buy a new smart phone, computer, car, or dishwasher, for example, wait until September 25, your very best day of the month to buy an electronic item. I love this day for signing papers, too.</p>
<p>By the time you get to the new moon on September 14, (to be influential for months, but strongest in the first 10 days), you will be firmly focused on your work life. It appears you are doing a lot of strategy and behind-the-scenes planning. Pluto is beaming powerful, strong beams to the Sun and new moon, so apparently higher-ups will be delighted with your work. Additionally, Jupiter and Uranus will also be beaming golden vibrations to the Sun and new moon, making this an extraordinarily positive new moon, and you may make more money through a bonus, raise, or company benefits (which would also be valuable).</p>
<p>By mid-month, Saturn will have stopped adding pressure to your domestic life but will switch your focus to your work, and you will need to give it all you’ve got. You are entering a more strenuous period, so be sure you are well rested and taking good care of yourself. Mercury will go direct on September 15, so you won’t feel like you have to backpedal so much. Mercury started to retrograde on August 23, but you started to feel his slowdown two weeks prior to that date.</p>
<p>Mercury in retrograde likely caused to you to redo things more often than usual or to repeat communication. If you felt like you were in a returning loop, going round and round, getting nowhere, that’s a common experience with Mercury retrograde. If you are hiring staff (very possible) at work or at home, hire your choice candidates on or after September 15 for best results.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>Mars, your ruling planet, is currently in Libra, suggesting you are doing quite a bit of collaboration these days at home, in your love life, and at work. Aries is usually most comfortable when in the lead, not collaborating, but this month you may find it a relief to have qualified people around you who are committed to the same goals as you. Interrelationships will be smooth, so together you should get a lot done.</p>
<p>It will be a comfort for you to know that the pressure you feel at the start of September regarding home or family matters, and mid-month regarding your work-a-day projects, will lighten by month’s end. Don’t assume this is how things will always be—things will change for the better.</p>
<p>By the full moon in Aries on September 29, life will start to become sweet again. You will be in the spotlight, receiving kudos from management and clients. Over the past months, you will have learned a great deal in a relatively short period. By this point in the month, you will have mastered your new schedule. Saturn will no longer apply more pressure, so by month’s end, you will feel renewed and rightly proud of all you’ve accomplished.</p>
