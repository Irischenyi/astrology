        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>You have a good month shaping up that will first emphasize your home and family, then later, your growing career, and finally at month’s end, breathless love. September will bring you what you may have felt was lacking over the past two months—progress and productivity. Two major planets that orbit close to Earth, Venus and Mercury, have both been retrograde, the reason for your frustrations, but both will turn forward this month.</p>
<p>Venus will go direct on September 3, having been out of phase since July 22. Venus has been in your travel sector, so if you did travel a far distance, you likely were met with unforeseen postponements or delays, crossed signals, and miscommunications, and in all, August was not the best time to take a trip.</p>
<p>Additionally, Venus rules romance, beauty, luxury, money, and parties, and all these areas were lacking in the enjoyment they usually provide. Venus retrograde makes life seem a little lackluster. In recent months I wrote a lot about Venus in your forecasts, and I asked you to put off treatments from your dermatologist or ones involving cosmetic dentistry. It was not the time to try a radical new hair style or color either. To be clear, scheduling good grooming activities, such as routine hair trims, were OK to do. I didn’t want you to look like a little ragamuffin! Venus retrograde was also not the time to spend on precious gems, if you were in the market for diamonds, sapphires, or emeralds—or anything like gold jewelry. Ah, Venus, what would the world be like without you? Now, after September 3, you can resume all these activities. Venus will not retrograde again for 18 months.</p>
<p>There is one little consideration. As you begin the month, Mercury will still be retrograde, a backward slide that this planet started on August 23. September will have a slow start, but you might like that to get your bearings. Life will pick up speed in the second half, for Mercury will go direct on September 15.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>If possible, plan all your most important actions for after September 15. I would love for you to have both Venus and Mercury moving forward at the same time if you were about to make any important decisions or actions. This would be in an ideal world, which I realize is not always possible. If you can, it’s worth trying to wait. If you are dealing with a medical matter that can’t wait—don’t. Listen to your doctor, for time may be of the essence. I will address Mercury in more detail in a minute.</p>
<p>First, let’s talk about the effects of last month’s full moon in Pisces, 7 degrees, that appeared on August 30, and which will still be influential in your life as the full moon wanes, until September 4.</p>
<p>That full moon lit your fourth house of home and family, and I wrote a lot about the danger of water damage to your home, tainted water, rip tides in the ocean, and more. I made a list so long that my chief editor of Astrology Zone, Edward, called me and asked if he could shorten the list. I said, “OK, you can take out the danger posed from heavy snow on the roof, since that seems unlikely, but nothing else!” Edward, always good natured, laughed and said, “All right, the rest stays.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Your secret sauce will be your ability to bring structure and organization to where none exists and to show a consistent, reliable effort on all your projects.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>Problems related to water are not the only way this full moon may have affected you (and can still affect you until September 4). You may be dealing with concerning news about a family member, most likely a female relative. As astrologers, we always start with mother, then go down the list to wife, sister, aunt, female cousin, and so forth in pretty much that order. If you heard something, you likely have had to swing into action, or soon will.</p>
<p>Saturn was conjunct that full moon on August 30, giving it a serious tone. It is also possible you have decided to buy a house, for Saturn is the planet that makes us think long-term and plan for the future. Saturn often calls for sacrifice for future benefit, for Saturn is the planet that also rules the concept of time—this planet makes us want to use our time well. With Saturn in your home sector, you may, for the first time, feel you need more financial stability and a sense of security, so buying a home may appeal to you. Saturn has not been in this part of your chart for 29 years.</p>
<p>If you’re about to close on a house, with Mercery currently retrograde I would suggest that you not close until Mercury goes direct September 15. But if haven’t begun the process, this full moon may be the moment you decide that this is a worthy goal and begin to save up for a down payment. You might start to look at properties in the area you would like to live to get a feel for costs. If you have been saving and are almost ready to buy, you may now get pre-approved for a mortgage.</p>
<p>Mortgage rates are, for many, prohibitively high, but real estate experts say that you will get the largest array of choices now because fewer people are buying houses. You can buy now with the plan to renegotiate the interest rate with your bank as soon as rates start to come down, provided you get a fixed mortgage.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>I also feel that the seller might be willing to drop his asking price to one that is more attractive to you, especially if the seller has not found many people showing an interest in the property he has. (For clues, check how long the house or apartment has been listed.)</p>
<p>Ask your financial advisor and broker for their advice on your situation. I am simply transmitting information I see in the press. I will say this: There is a strong chance you will decide to buy property while Saturn is in Pisces. Saturn first entered this sign in March 2023 and is due to leave in February 2026.</p>
<p>Alternatively, with Saturn in Pisces, you may help a family member financially to get though a tough patch. If this is true for you, that person will be grateful for all you are doing (even if they don’t say so). Saturn shows the area where we can achieve the most substantial personal growth, and for you, that would be your actions toward home, other property, or family between now and February 2026.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to your career, which will get a big boost at the new moon in Virgo, 22 degrees, on September 14. This new moon will bring you many weeks of opportunity to get ahead in your career, but it will be up to you to show that you are ready to take on more responsibility and a higher profile in your industry. This new moon will open the doors for you just after (not before) it appears on September 14.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>You are very fortunate that Mercury, which rules your prestigious career growth solar tenth house, will turn direct on September 15, one day after the new moon occurs. This remarkable new moon will be the first point of a shimmering golden triangle of harmonious planets. Uranus, the planet of surprise and innovation, is currently in Taurus, your sixth house of daily work assignments. Uranus will be sending a tight electric beam to the new moon and Sun in Virgo on September 15. Your secret sauce will be your ability to bring structure and organization to where none exists and to show a consistent, reliable effort on all your projects.</p>
<p>Uranus is known to be the sometimes-bad boy of the solar system, known to turn tradition on its head when he senses it is time to change—and he acts quickly and decisively. You may need to be experimental and maybe even a bit rebellious, while at the same time realistic about what the public is ready for. As Steve Jobs said, “People don’t know what they want until you show it to them.” That is the spirit to have, dear Sagittarius.</p>
<p>Uranus is the planet of sharp intuition, and with it being so supportive of the new moon, you are up to this task. (Neptune is the other planet tied to on-target intuition, and both planets will be remarkably friendly to this September 14 new moon and to each other—an aspect rarely seen.) Creating something new and individual to you is a tall order, but you can navigate this narrow path.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the third point of the triangle will center on Pluto in Capricorn, your second house of earned income. This will complete the golden triangle of pure harmony. Pluto’s position shows clearly that there’s good money to be made from both your creative approach to your work and the growth you’ll achieve, as you soar to greater heights in your specialty. Keep to your program, and don’t be discouraged. The public is waiting for your next innovation, and most importantly, the universe is listening and watching.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>Nothing will happen fast because Mercury, the planet governing your career growth, will almost exactly oppose Saturn. Things will take time. Saturn is well-known to slow things down, partly because Saturn insists on striving for excellence. But while your competitors run out of energy and drop by the wayside, you will show staying power, being energized by doggedly pursuing your dream and fiercely fueled by your passions. With the sweet planetary support you will have now, you will be unstoppable.</p>
<p>Will life only be about a home or family situation and working toward major career growth? Actually, no. There will also be room for fun and romance, so you truly have a great chart in September.</p>
<p>You will have a lovely full moon in Aries, falling at 6 degrees, on September 29, a peach of a full moon tailor-made to bring a major uptick in your love life. It will light your fifth house of true love and new love, and you will feel the influence of this new moon within five days after it appears, from September 29 to October 4. As the full moon grows to its peak, you may see evidence of this as early as September 27 or 28.</p>
<p>A full moon in Aries, the place of new love in your chart, will be welcome news to you if you are single. You may meet someone you would like to know better, so look your best September 28-29 and over the weekend that follows. Mars will be the key planet at that time, and his conversations will give a big hint at the outcome of this full moon. Here is good news. Miraculously, Mars will be deep in a warm and affectionate conversation with Venus, his long-time lover. I have high hopes over this full moon for you to have a genuine and loving weekend.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>Venus and Mars are well known to get along like sugar and spice. Mars is in your friendship sector (eleventh house), Libra, an air sign that blends perfectly with your fire element. It seems a friend may make the fateful introduction, or the meeting may be a gathering or party. And Venus is in fellow fire-sign Leo.</p>
<p>The eleventh house also rules groups, and whenever people come to gather for a common cause, that’s an eleventh house activity—the area of your chart that is glowing brightly for you. You may meet at a convention, seminar, church breakfast, spiritual retreat, industry luncheon, or other function, such as a charity, humanitarian, community, or political fundraiser. You might meet a special someone while traveling, your favorite activity, when someone interesting sits next to you on an airplane. Alternatively, you might meet a new romantic interest when you stay for a week or weekend at an elegant resort not far from home.</p>
<p>If you are already attached to the person you love, start planning to make the September 29 weekend special.</p>
<p>This same house being lit on September 29 rules conception, birth, and the care of children. The ancient astrologers wrote so much about the fifth house covering children that I was beginning to feel that romance was, for them, an afterthought. That’s not true in modern times, though, as astrologers know the fifth house rules both love and children. At this full moon you may find out you or your partner is expecting a baby, and because the full moon will be so friendly to Pluto, Venus, and Mars, chances are, you will be happy to discover this.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>If you have your children, you can plan a surprise outing for them. Children who are older than five or six can remember happy times in more detail than you might suppose. Here’s your chance to create an indelible memory woven in golden threads that they will remember forever.</p>
<p>Another way this full moon may work out is that you may finish up a deeply personal creative expression or project for yourself or for a client that you’ll be proud to show. A full moon in Aries suggests that praise and applause for your work will emanate from your willingness to take a creative risk. At this full moon, use Uranus’ role as innovator and his urging to consider flying in the face of tradition, for if it fits and you handle it right, you will be hailed as a rock star.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>As you begin September, you will be thinking about your home, other property, or a family member. Saturn will conjoin the moon, suggesting that you will be spending money on your property or moving into a new space. Alternatively, you may be renting a vacation home. At the start of September, home and family will take your full concentration.</p>
<p>Many Sagittarians are coping with water damage due to the presence of Neptune in this same fourth house of home and property in your chart. Neptune has wrought havoc on many Sagittarians’ property and lives ever since this planet entered watery Pisces back in 2011. The fact that Neptune is in Pisces and also rules Pisces only made its actions stronger.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>It would be wise for you to get as much water damage and flood insurance for your home as you can muster. Flood insurance is not a normal part of a home owner’s policy, so you need to ask for a rider. Many insurance companies are refusing to add insurance for flooding and other water damage, so you may have to do a bit of research. Once Neptune leaves Pisces, this planet will not be back to Pisces in your lifetime, as it takes Neptune 168 years to rotate around the Sun. Neptune is due to permanently leaves Pisces and enter Aries in January 2026.</p>
<p>If your home or other property is not your focus at the start of the month, due to the full moon of August 30, influential until September 4, you will likely be thinking about a family member. The moon points to a female—you may be trying to help your mother, grown daughter, sister, or other beloved female relative. Full moons require quick action, so it appears you will act, the situation will be solved, and you will move on.</p>
<p>Mercury will still be retrograde, a holdover from August 23, so you will find that things will move along slowly. Don’t rail against the inability to get hold of the VIPs who you need to get final approvals from others first—chances are, you are not dealing with the final decision maker. Even if you are speaking to the person with the power to say yes or no, delays will benefit you. Mercury will get back into its groove when it goes direct on September 15.</p>
<p>This is good timing, because a superb new moon will occur on September 14, to be influential in your professional tenth house for six months. Keep in mind, however, that this new moon in Virgo will be strongest in the two weeks after it occurs—the second half of this month. This new moon is gorgeous, one of the best of the year, and if you are ambitious, this glittering new moon will reveal opportunities to scale greater heights in your career. You will have to do your part and look for those openings, but if you do, this new moon will be your fairy godmother.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>This new moon is special because it will occur at the very pinnacle in your chart and will be in close touch with Uranus (surprise) in Taurus, your solar sixth house of daily assignments. This new moon will also be in perfect conversation with Pluto in Capricorn, your house of earned income. This suggests that you will make a tidy sum from your hard work and growing reputation at work. In other words, hard work plus your growing reputation and consistently fine performance will lead to generous compensation. This seems logical, but life is not always fair, and doing a great job does not always lead to more money. For you, however, it does.</p>
<p>Romance will be in the air at month’s end thanks to a big, tender full moon on September 29 in Aries, lighting your fifth house of true love. You may meet someone new who you would like to know better. It is also possible that you will be talking about an exciting impending event. It would be one that would involve many people, such as a large celebration party or a fun convention—something that you are looking forward to attending. Matters related to children and romance will be stellar.</p>
<p>At the same time, you may be ready to unveil a creative project you designed and spearheaded at this same full moon of September 29, plus five days. If so, you will find this project turns out to be a jewel in your crown, for it will be very well received, and others will view you in a new light—putting you on the short list of one to watch, for you are likely to make even greater accomplishments in the future.</p>
