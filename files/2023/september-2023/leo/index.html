        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>As you reach September, you may still be thinking about news that came up at the August 30 full moon in Pisces, 7 degrees. It appears to have been news that centered on money, most likely a large sum that you would have to pay.</p>
<p>Saturn was conjunct that full moon, so you would have no ability to delay or negotiate the payment, but it seems you expected it. You are ruled by the solar system’s brilliant star, the Sun, and being this was a full moon and Saturn was in opposition to the Sun, you will likely feel some strain, financially, emotionally, physically—or possibly all three.</p>
<p>If you are not paying a large invoice, then you should check your bank account and credit card statements in case you have been subject to identity theft. If you expected a check that someone said they sent you and it did not arrive, call that person to follow up. Here is why.</p>
<p>Post office mail theft in the US has become rampant, and perhaps this has been unbeknown to you. The thief washes the name of the recipient (you) on the check and places their own bogus name in its place. (The police department posted signs in the lobby of my Manhattan high-rise apartment building saying not to send any checks by mail in the future.) You can Google “mail fraud” to find out where mail fraud is happening, possibly near you (I hope not!). You can talk with your bank, too—they are well aware of this problem.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>Identity theft multiplied during the pandemic when stimulus checks were being sent out to a great many people. If the check is large, I suggest you ask the sender to wire you the funds (and offer to pay the bank fee if there is one). If the person sending you money prefers to write a check, ask it to be sent by FedEx, UPS, DHL, or messenger. (If someone is to send me money, I will sometimes send them a FedEx airbill from my account for their convenience.)</p>
<p>If you say this full moon of August 30 did not deliver its message last month, it will do so no later than September 4. I wrote a lot about this full moon last month in my August report for you. I mention it here because I think you will still be dealing with the news and deciding how to handle this financial matter.</p>
<p>If you are not dealing with money management as the month opens, then you might be going in for surgery soon, as the eighth house, where this full moon falls in your chart, also rules surgery. If it is elective surgery, like a face lift, I would wait until after Mercury goes direct (September 15). If it is urgent, by all means have the operation—September is a very positive month and far better than July and August were.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Virgo new moon September 14 is a peach and will seem like a beautiful fairy godmother ready to help you achieve your dream of making a good salary.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>If you won’t be having a medical procedure, it might be a close member of your family, or a friend, who is. You might volunteer to be that person’s cheerful helper or advocate.</p>
<p>Now that Mars has exited from Virgo, recently on August 27, the heavy expenses that seem to have been coming at you should simmer down. It seems you have been facing a lot of expenses, and most likely you had good reason, so seeing the number of bills drop will be good news. We just all have to get through this August 30 full moon (no matter what our zodiac sign happens to be). We all will feel better as we move deeper into September.</p>
<p>With Mars in Libra, you will get a chance to travel a little, even if it will only be to nearby scenic places. The seasons are changing now, the light looks different—in the Northern Hemisphere, it’s turning a deep golden yellow, complete with long dark shadows, a perfect backdrop for the brilliant changing foliage. In the Southern Hemisphere as spring starts to bloom, the harsh light of winter begins to turn a soft pink-bluish white as days grow longer. That softer light is kind to the tiny flowers of every description and every pastel that will soon appear everywhere. You might want to celebrate the season by taking a drive into the country or a train to a weekend resort at a location not too far out of town.</p>
<p>Venus has been retrograding in Leo since July 22, but will, at long last, go direct on September 3. This should boost your popularity and charm in every way, for Venus will continue to remain in Leo until next month, October 8. Venus works best when her lover Mars is close and beaming lovely rays to his sweetheart, and that will happen now that Mars is in air-sign Libra. They will move close enough to be almost in an exact sextile—a lovely opportunity aspect—by the new moon of September 14.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>Once Venus is direct (September 3), you can schedule those dermatological and cosmetic dental treatments or ask your stylist to create a new way to wear or color your hair. You can buy diamonds and emeralds and give a lavish party—having Venus back to strong orbit is always fun. You can also begin dating again. I would wait until Mercury goes direct September 15 before doing most of these activities, however. Here is the story on Mercury.</p>
<p>Mercury, the planet in charge of meetings, negotiations, communication, contacts and agreements, buying and selling, travel, and transportation, and also rules the electronic chips and all moving parts in machines, has been retrograding since August 23.</p>
<p>Happily, the new moon in Virgo will appear on September 14, and Mercury will go direct (in Virgo, too) the next day, September 15. You will start to see things move ahead with a blast of energy immediately. Why not wait for both Venus and Mercury to be direct before you plan your biggest initiations? These two planets orbit close to Earth, so they (along with Mars, which is in fine shape) are the planets you feel most when retrograde.</p>
<p>What is the new moon about on September 14? More good news. This new moon is the best one of the year to help you make more money. If you had a difficult time with money at the full moon of August 30, this new moon could help you reverse that trend and help generate quite a bit more income. While the August 30 full moon had brought a sobering financial conclusion (or you may have lost something), this new moon on September 14 will open a fresh path toward generating personal cash. This new moon will appear in your second house of earned income.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>Best of all, this new moon and Sun in Virgo at 22 degrees will be part of a golden triangle. The Sun and new moon at one point of the triangle (Virgo) will receive golden rays from Pluto in Capricorn, your work-a-day sector of projects and the second point of the triangle. It looks like a new, lucrative assignment is about to come in. The third and final point of the triangle will hold Uranus, planet of surprise, in Taurus, beaming this new moon from your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement. It seems this new assignment could be quite prestigious and allow you to work on more projects of this caliber if you work hard and do well on this one. If you are self-employed, do some advertising or self-promotion or plan a social media campaign to generate business. Your efforts will pay off.</p>
<p>If you are making a deal, make sure you have “crossed all your t’s and dotted all your i’s” because Neptune will oppose the new moon and could fog some of the facts and conditions of the deal with miscommunication or misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Yet Neptune will not spoil the pudding. Neptune is the planet ruling all creativity and the arts, so if you are working on an artistic project, Neptune’s participation will actually be a plus and help you create something quite beautiful.</p>
<p>Speaking of working hard, taskmaster Saturn will oppose Mercury at the time of this September 14 new moon. It makes me think that you will work hard in weeks and months ahead—Saturn likes to see that you will give him undivided attention. The fact that you will concentrate on the job at hand is perfect—it will ensure your success.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>The month will close on a fun note. You have a lovely full moon coming on September 29 in adventuresome Aries, 6 degrees. This full moon will urge you to hop a plane and visit a foreign country. You may be going for personal reasons, perhaps flying overseas or a far distance to see a sister or brother, or to find a sunny location where you can relax and be active in sports. There is another possibility: You may be flying to an exciting spot to enjoy quality time with the person you love and make it truly romantic. With Venus in Leo, things should go exceptionally well.</p>
<p>If you are working on an immigration program and hope to be admitted to another country with a visa or residency card or be given a passport, this full moon may be the moment you awaited. It’s all good.</p>
<p>There is a chance you might travel for work to negotiate a deal in person. If this is the way things work out, you may be signing a contract, and by this point in the month, Mercury will no longer be retrograde. You may not have to fly at all, but rather, you may be on the phone and email a great deal with a VIP client or colleague who is based in a foreign land.</p>
<p>Mars will be the key planet at this full moon in Aries on September 29, and thank goodness Mars will still be cuddling up to Venus, even being a little closer in degree than he was mid-month! Having a well-placed Mars at this full moon would be very important for a good outcome, so the fact that Mars will be so warm and loving to Venus (which I can see mathematically) nearly ensures you will be pleased with the results of this full moon and the experiences you have at this time.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>You may reap other benefits from other areas of life too, so here is the list: A legal case may be settled in your favor, or you may get superb publicity in the press for noteworthy work you’ve been doing. If a book you wrote is being published at this time, reviews should be stellar. If you are an undergraduate or graduate student (or hope to be admitted to an institution of your choice soon), this full moon should bring good news and progress.</p>
<p>If you are a Leo with a birthday that falls on July 29, have Leo rising, or have your natal moon in Leo, in all cases at 7 degrees, plus or minus five degrees, you will get a double dip of pleasure from all that comes up for you near September 29. The same is true if you have a planet in Leo, Aries, Sagittarius, Gemini, Libra, or Aquarius at 7 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. Watch what happens—that planet will be lit up and go the distance to help you.</p>
<p>Before I close, a quick note about your rising sign and natal planets (which I just mentioned above). Your rising sign is the sign that was on the eastern horizon at the moment of your birth, and the only way to determine your rising sign is to have your chart done. Knowing your rising sign is as important as your Sun sign, and you should read your forecast for both signs once you know it. Having your chart will also tell you where all your natal planets are, that is where all the planets were (and at what degree) when you were born.</p>

        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You will be doing a lot of money management in September, and you will see this trend take root immediately. The full moon that occurred near the end of last month on August 30, which lit your eighth house of other people’s money, will still be strong in the first days of September.</p>
<p>Saturn conjoined that full moon and opposed the Sun, so your determination to earn more money will become an urgent goal. It may be triggered by having to pay for an obligation you had committed to earlier and need to pay now. Of course, a new expense may also come up, but it appears you expected this invoice. There will be no way to delay the payment.</p>
<p>Your timing for finding more or better work has never been better, because of all the zodiac signs, you are most likely to make spectacular career progress. Jupiter, the good fortune planet, will help you every step of the way. Jupiter has not been in this, your most prestigious career sector tenth house, for 12 years, and Jupiter is ready to roll up his sleeves to help you get your dream job. You have not had huge cosmic help like this in over a decade.</p>
<p>Your career status will quickly rise in the marketplace, and you have an equally strong likelihood of commanding a commensurate compensation package. This was a great full moon, August 30, to be hearing back about recent interviews you’ve been having with various firms. (Add five days to August 30 as the area of influence for this full moon.)</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>There is also a warning—with teacher planet Saturn in your eighth house, you’ll need to make timely payments for taxes and credit cards and keep your overall credit rating in excellent standing. Saturn is known for his tough-love methods and has not been in Pisces, this financial sector (ruling taxes, loans, credit cards and more) since 1994-1996, so this trend may feel new to you. Work with Saturn’s demands, for he has your best interests at heart. It also seems like you are moving into a new tax bracket. Keep in close touch all year with your accountant so that you are sure to make timely tax payments, too. This would be doubly true if you are self-employed.</p>
<p>You will start to see progress on the financial front mid-month, for the new moon on September 14 is a peach, appearing in Virgo, and will seem like a beautiful fairy godmother, ready to help you achieve your dream of making a good salary. All new moons open a door, but this one is special because it will appear in your salary and income sector and will joyfully signal Uranus in Taurus, the planet of surprises in your esteemed tenth house of professional awards and advancement. The new moon and Sun will simultaneously send a golden beam to Pluto, a major financial planet, in your sixth house of work-a-day projects. Keep to your program—you are on the right track—and this new moon will likely help you achieve your goal.</p>
<p>Neptune will oppose the new moon and Sun, so you will have to look closely at the fine print of any new deal you enter into. This planet is known to obscure facts, causing the other party either to keep you in the dark or leave out certain pertinent information. Have a lawyer at your side to look closely at the details. If you are entering into a creative project, however, Neptune, as the planet that governs the arts, will be very helpful in coaxing you to come up with original, breathtaking ideas.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>The process will not necessarily be easy because the new moon of September 14 finds Saturn opposed to Mercury (and Mercury rules your solar income sector). You will have to keep your eyes on the road and your hands on the wheel. Life can be a hot, sweaty process at times, but don’t give up, not with the Sun, new moon, Jupiter, Uranus, and Pluto all rooting for you and bringing the right kind of opportunities if you look for them.</p>
<p>In terms of romance, Venus has been retrograding in Leo since July 22, which may have put a damper on your love life. Happily, Venus will turn direct September 3 and will stay in Leo, this time in strong shape, until October 8. With Mars in graceful air-sign Libra and Venus in Leo, a dynamic duo, you will be unstoppable.</p>
<p>Mercury will be retrograde until September 15, so plan on signing any contracts or doing any major ventures after this date. Your best day to sign papers will be September 25—that’s a day that would be hard to beat for happy results and for making good money. You’ve got this, dear Leo!</p>
<p>As the month closes, the full moon on September 29 will help you if you’re publishing or have a legal case, and with the likelihood of a positive outcome, you might then decide to travel. With Venus in Leo, you may decide to hop a plane with your sweetie and go see the flora changing to reds, oranges, and yellows in the Northern Hemisphere or the blossoming pale pastel colors of spring if you live south of the equator. Although the month may start slow, September will pick up speed and end well.</p>
