        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>Everything is coming up roses for you in September. After months of frustration, feeling like you were living through Groundhog Day—a circular loop of no progress, just the same day repeated over many times—now, a breakthrough is due. You have been hampered by Venus retrograde. Venus is your ruling planet that goes into a slow motion every 18 months for approximately 40 days. It may have felt longer. Venus will go direct on September 3, and often when a planet goes direct, news comes in right away—see what happens on September 3 or in the few days that follow that date.</p>
<p>Venus rules love, good looks, luxury, beauty, and if you refrained from first dates, dermatological treatments, luxurious spa treatments, and buying that one beautiful expensive item you’ve had your eye on. You can resume these and related normal activities soon.</p>
<p>You were also hampered by Mercury retrograde in Virgo, the sign it rules, making this retrograde extra strong. Mercury turned out of phase on August 23, but you felt the slowdown two weeks earlier, turning August into a quagmire of delays, miscommunications, errors, and other of life’s frustrations. Mercury will go direct on September 15.</p>
<p>You will soon see life move forward with great speed after September 15, and it will be exciting and gratifying. If you wait to act on important things until after September 15, you will be glad you did.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>Now let’s talk about the full moon that occurred last month in Pisces on August 30 that will affect you until September 4. That full moon lit your eleventh house of friendships, so one friend was your focus. Either your friend was difficult with you, or you may have heard news that your friend was going through a hard time and needs your help. This full moon alternatively may have brought news from a club you belong to (or had summitted an application to join). Saturn, the planet of the lessons we learn in life and the responsibilities we take on, was conjunct this full moon, which created a serious tone and urged you to face what “is” rather than what you wish “could be.”</p>
<p>Saturn was opposed to the Sun, so something going on in your family or residential property may have at the same time been vying for your attention. You may go to a social or group gathering that has a serious undertone as the reason for meeting. Neptune will play an important role in the same house and reach out in a friendly way to Uranus in Taurus, or the meeting or event might please you and work to your favor quite unexpectedly, even though it has a somber reason for being. My point is, you can turn events around and find a silver lining in the first days of September thanks to help from surprise-a-minute planet Uranus. This tells me the final resolve of this full moon should be positive, although you may doubt this to be the case initially.</p>
<p>Good news comes for your romantic life at the new moon September 14 in Virgo at 22 degrees, and it is one of my favorites of the year for you. It will light your fifth house, which covers true love, matters related to pregnancy, birth, and the care of children, as well as artistic expression.</p>

        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>If you want more love in your life and you are not dating, this new moon, from September 14 moving forward, will be the best time of the year to circulate. Be open to meeting all kinds of people. Ask friends to make introductions. This would also be the right time to take a vacation, for you might meet someone from your own city on that trip.</p>
<p>You currently have Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, in your own sign for the first time in 12 years. Having Jupiter in your Sun sign is the best aspect you could ever have to meet the love of your life. By all means socialize as much as you can this month because you also have that encouraging new moon of September 14 to help you. Your will have opportunities for love until Jupiter leaves on May 25, 2024—however, this month could work out to be extra special. This month the most likely place to meet someone new will be at a party, not at the office. Jupiter is also known to broaden your outlook, so this would be an absolutely wonderful time to take an overseas trip.</p>
<p>If you are attached (married or dating seriously), Saturn opposed to the Sun may put your partner under a strain at work. Do what you can to keep homelife stable and happy because this month it appears your partner is handling a lot of pressure. (In a chart, the Sun is read as male, so if this is not your partner, check in with your father.)</p>
<p>If you hope to start or add to your family, this new moon of September 14 could find you shopping for baby clothes sooner than you thought possible. (If you are not ready, be careful.) If you are younger than 35, this is also the time to freeze your eggs to give yourself options. (It is not a painful process—they put you to sleep, and they ask you to have a friend pick you up. Freezing their eggs has been a lifesaver for many women who may want a baby someday.) This is also a fantastic month for news that your adoptive baby is ready for you to come meet and to take your new child home.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>If you are creative, this new moon—which will send great vibrations to you for months, but is strongest just after it appears, September 14, plus 10 days— may bring a new project that appears to be tailor-made for you.</p>
<p>Mars moved into Libra on August 27 to stay until October 11, a period when your work life will be very busy. This is not the time to change jobs necessarily (unless you have Capricorn rising) because Mars in the sixth house would only bring a job with equal status and similar in responsibility to the one you already have. Said another way, it would not represent a step up. Once Venus is moving direct (September 3) and Mercury is too (September 15), you will be pleased with the progress you make in the second half of the month. Of course, if you are very unhappy at your job, need to get out, and are not necessarily interested in advancing your position in the industry, then yes, you can accept a new position in the second half of September.</p>
<p>Let me pause here for a moment and talk to you about your rising sign, also called your ascendant, which I mentioned above. You can only find your rising sign by doing a personal chart, and you can now do your own chart on my site. It’s right on the front page of Astrologyzone.com (it’s not on my app, only on my Internet site). Just look for the headline “Free Natal Birth Chart.” It’s easy to put in your information, it’s free, and you can do your chart as many times as you’d like. Once you know your rising sign, you should read for both your ascendant and your Sun sign.</p>
<p>Now, back to your report.</p>
<p>Monday September 25 would be a superb day to travel for Mercury in Virgo will be in superb angle to Jupiter in Taurus. You will start to feel this incredibly beneficial aspect over the preceding weekend, September 23-24. September 25 would also be a perfect time to negotiate and sign a contract.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>You will encounter another full moon on September 29 in Aries, 6 degrees. This is a great full moon, full of happy surprises and spontaneous news. This full moon should be used as a restful period. If you hope to travel, don’t overpack your schedule with activities. With Mars in perfect angle to Venus, that would be a lovely time to visit a family member. If your family lives out of town, even better—Mercury in Virgo will be trine Uranus in Taurus on Saturday September 30, an ideal time to travel. You’d have lots of fun. Or you could spontaneously decide to visit mom and dad.</p>
<p>As you see, after September 15, you have a near-perfect month, sure to bring happiness in every way.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Life is coming together perfectly in September, even though you may have doubted recently that anything would click into place. You will see, things are getting better and better. July and August may have had moments of frustration, so September will be a breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>September is a supremely graceful month, although as you enter it, you may be concerned about a close woman friend. The full moon of August 30 will still have a strong influence on you until September 4. That full moon would be in Pisces, your eleventh house of friendships, so you would be drawn to a friend (the moon always points to a woman). Saturn will be very close to the moon, possibly giving concern for her wellness or about a difficult patch she is going through. You may decide to help by occasionally cooking meals for her family, or you may volunteer to care for her children from time to time while she goes to meetings, appointments, or medical treatments.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>Alternatively, this same full moon may bring an opposite experience—a falling out with a friend. You have to see how things go.</p>
<p>This full moon can bring to fruition one of your deepest hopes and wishes, so something you’ve long wanted to see materialize—a dream—may finally happen near September 1 to September 4. There is an indication that you will be surrounded by friends and perhaps some acquaintances, too. (It is also possible you already experienced this full moon on August 30 or August 31.)</p>
<p>There is plenty of activity going on at home, and whether you are planning to wed or are already wed or living together, you may notice that your partner is under a strain, that he or she is handling a great deal of responsibility at work. Be sympathetic and helpful by doing what you can to keep things peaceful and steady at home</p>
<p>Turning to the new moon of September 14, this point of the month will be a joyous one—and it could work out to be one of the best new moons of the year for you. This new moon will appear in Virgo, your fifth house of true love, and receive shimmering rays from both Jupiter, the good-fortune planet, and Uranus, planet of surprise. Both are in Taurus. Celebratory news could easily surface, and there are several different main messages it may bring.</p>
<p>If you are single, a surprise, exciting first-time meeting with a new romantic interest could happen at a party or other social event. If, instead, you have been dating seriously for some time, you may get (or make) an unexpected proposal. If married, your partner may have been putting together a surprise for you that may involve a whirlwind international trip to a place neither of you have been and can discover together.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>If you are hoping for a baby, with so much planetary activity directed toward your fifth house, a place in the chart that also rules children along with love, you may discover that you will be expecting a baby soon.</p>
<p>If you are artistic, this new moon of September 14 will be a blessing, for you might also start an important creative project that would be perfect for you—in fact, it may seem almost tailor-made for you. This month, of the 10 celestial bodies (eight planets plus the Sun and moon), you will have six in earth signs, so as an earth sign yourself, you will feel very at home with the atmosphere of the month.</p>
<p>The full moon on August 30 (plus five days) and new moon September 14 (plus weeks ahead) will both be in perfect angle to Jupiter, suggesting you will be paid well for your artistic project, or if the full moon brings a personal celebration, you will receive generous, valuable gifts. (Be sure to register your preferences online in case friends ask—they will!)</p>
<p>Pluto will also be well aspected too, so you may have an international connection to the topic you are focused on this month. If so, you will garner enviable support from that person based afar.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>Saturn will oppose Mercury on September 14, so you will feel a bit of pressure, for Mercury is taking the lead at the September 14 new moon. It may seem that there is so much to do with too little time. (Saturn rules the concept of time among other things, like responsibilities.) Planets in earth signs send out an objective, responsible vibration, so you are equipped to break tasks down into smaller ones and delegate some if necessary.</p>
<p>At work, with Mars adding activity, you have plenty to do there, too. Yet despite all you have to do, you are impressing your boss or client and getting positive reviews for your diligence, judgment, intelligence, and good work ethic.</p>
<p>By month’s end, the full moon will appear on September 29 in Aries, your twelfth house, a place of privacy and rest. You will need time to collect your thoughts and reflect on events. Mercury has been retrograde since August 23, but as of September 15, Mercury will be direct, and you likely will see the speed of events pick up after that.</p>




        <h2>Your September Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>Venus has been retrograde too, since July 22, but Venus is to go direct this month on September 3. This is significant too, not only because Venus is in charge of love, happiness, beauty, and luxury, but just as importantly, Venus is your ruling planet in charge of looking after your interests. When any planet is retrograde, its powers are reduced and hard to access, but this month, as both Venus and Mercury turn direct, the doors will open, and impediments will drop away.</p>
<p>You can have dermatological treatments like Botox or fillers, and you can buy a new skin care line if you have been thinking of trying a new routine. Venus has been languishing in Leo while in retrograde, but will soon move into Virgo on October 8 until November 8, your sweet spot for attracting and expanding love and for finding the perfect ways to refresh your look. You have a very happy outlook in months to come.</p>
