        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>As the month begins, a full moon in Sagittarius at 13 degrees will appear on June 3, so you may be spending precious, quality time your parents or children, and with Mars sending happy beams to this full moon, life might feel deliciously warm and cozy. Your travel house is briming with happy planets, so you may have taken a trip with your family (or traveled to see your family) to make this time memorable.</p>
<p>Saturn will be in hard angle to the Sun and full moon on June 3, so inside you may feel the weight of caring for your family and wondering why no one—not friends, siblings, or other relatives—seems to truly understand how many obligations you have been juggling on a daily basis. Nevertheless, as a Virgo you will never turn away from helping a person in need, and it is this very quality that others find so loveable in you.</p>
<p>With Mars behind the scenes now (twelfth house), having begun when Mars entered Leo on May 20, you will crave privacy and rest. Last year, you worked very hard on your career from August 20, 2022, to this year, March 25, 2023. If anyone deserves a rest now, it is you. You seem not to want to be overly social (you likely had your fill from March 25 to May 20), but will be content to do one-on-one lunches with friends and enjoy phone calls to catch up.</p>
<p>There are other possibilities associated with this full moon June 3. You may be moving house, selling property, or renting or buying a house or condo. As a full moon will conclude things within five days of the its appearance, it seems to be a done deal, and you may be moving in now. You may alternatively decide to stay put but spruce things up by buying a beautiful new piece of furniture, making needed repairs, or calling in the painters. Or you may ask a landscape designer to liven up your property. There are many things that may be finishing up within five days of this full moon of June 3. Anything you do, even small improvements, will instantly make living at home more enjoyable.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>This month Jupiter and Saturn will be in perfect sync, creating a four-star aspect that has not occurred in a similar way since August 2017. The full moon in Sagittarius will put Jupiter in the center of all that is happening at this full moon, so if you are buying a house or condo, renovating, or buying furniture, your investment will likely give you years of pleasure and will actually help to appreciate your home’s value.</p>
<p>This four-star aspect involving Jupiter and Saturn will not happen again for years and will peak in perfect sextile (bringing a brilliant stabilizing opportunity) on June 19. Both planets are slow-moving, so Jupiter and Saturn will already be within mathematical significance on June 3, the full moon, and you will reap the benefits.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to your career, which is showing lots of action this month. If you have been thinking of looking for a new job, or hoping you would be promoted, the new moon of June 17 and the days and months that follow would be perfect to schedule interviews. All the work you did last year while Mars was in Gemini from August 20, 2022, to March 25, 2023, should put you an excellent position to find something new. If you are self-employed, the same outlook applies, and you can now start to look for new, prestigious clients after June 17.</p>
<blockquote><p>The new moon June 17 will mark one of the most important points of this year to bring you fresh opportunities and new ventures to consider.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>This new moon does bring opportunities for advancement, but you need to be careful. Neptune will be in hard angle to the Sun and new moon, fogging information and details. You may be enthusiastic about the new position and rush to accept it before you know the parameters of all you will be expected to do. You need to find a way to get full disclosure, and perhaps the only way you can get it is by asking detailed questions and possibly being able to have access to other employees who would work at your level. Sometimes the latter is possible. I am not saying that your prospective employer is consciously trying to withhold information—it all may be purely unconscious.</p>
<p>Saturn will be in hard angle to the new moon, so the job you discuss is likely to be a responsible one but will come with power and influence, too. Saturn is in your seventh house of partners and collaborators, so there is another detail to watch.</p>
<p>Your agent, job broker, headhunter, manager, business partner, or even your spouse may urge you to take the job because of the solid salary being offered. But the possible commission or extra money that person would make if you did take it might impair his or her his judgment. If you are on the horns of a dilemma about the job, you will need to do your due diligence on this offer and not rely on anyone who holds the role in your circle that I listed.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to romance, which could manifest in one of two ways. Astrologers call the close orbit of Venus and Mars a celebratory aspect, for their coming together sets off the sparks of attraction that often leads to love. On June 5, Venus will enter Leo, joining her lover Mars, already in Leo. These two lovebirds will remain within four to six tiny degrees of closeness during the rest of June. That is considered very significant mathematically.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>As said, there are two ways this may turn out. If you are attached, you may decide to take a very private getaway this month for “just us two.” It could be one of the most romantic of the year. The fact that Venus and Mas are in Leo suggests you are in the mood for some pampering, so you might want to check into a beautiful five-star hotel for a long weekend this month to enjoy the spa, the pool, and breakfast in bed.</p>
<p>The other way this could work out, albeit not as likely for a Virgo, is that you may be drawn into a clandestine affair where one or both of you are committed to someone else. You may not know the object of your affections is married—you may not find out until much later, as one example. These types of attachments rarely work out well, and I don’t think this is the way the closeness of Venus and Mars will affect you, dear Virgo because of all the signs, Virgo is a spiritual sign known for faithfulness and ethical conduct.</p>
<p>Here is another important fact to consider: Next month, starting July 22 and continuing until September 3, Venus will go retrograde in Leo, shutting down Venus’ gifts of love, romance, beauty, elegance, funds, and financial reward. Venus will remain in Leo until October 8, a very long time for Venus to stay in one sign.</p>
<p>You will finally have Venus in Virgo later this year from October 8 to November 8—a period when your charisma will be at an all-time high. Venus will turn direct on September 3, so by the time Venus moves into Virgo, she will be in good strong shape for you.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>There are some activities to avoid when Venus is retrograde. Her association with beauty and good looks tells me that that this is not the time (July 22 to September 3) to have a face-lift, Botox or fillers, or cosmetic dental work. Don’t ask your stylist for a radically different hair style or to have a dramatic change of hair color. Men, don’t shave off your beard. Stick to the status quo.</p>
<p>You can schedule those appointments now in June or wait until after September 15. I like October even more when Venus will be in Virgo, but stay clear of the two eclipses October 14 and October 28. Mercury, your ruler, will retrograde August 23 to September 15, so avoid that period, too. You see how I have to look at the entire sky when I give advice to you!</p>
<p>Before I go, I want to tell you that you have a tender full moon in Capricorn on July 3 to light your fifth house of true love. It looks like you will be starting next month, July, on a VERY romantic note. This same house rules the care and fun with children, pregnancy, and birth, as well as the deepest expression of your creativity and artistry. You have plenty to look forward to in July!</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>In the first week of the month, home and family will be your entire focus. You may be moving house, having new furniture delivered, or seeing some sort of change in your physical space come to a conclusion.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>Alternatively, you may want to spend time with your family—your children, your parents, or both. You may get news about a family member who is about to have an impending change in their life, and you might want to help your relative—sister, brother, aunt, uncle, parent, or one of your children—ease into a new situation. Mars will be very supportive, so you’re likely to enjoy your time with family. If you are trying to help a parent or grown son or daughter, you may have to maneuver around a few obstacles as you go along because surrounding planets will not be cooperating with one another. You will need to be clever and resourceful—you’re a mutable sign, so you, of all people, can do this.</p>
<p>Also, at the very start of the month someone at work, possibly a subordinate who reports to you, might seem stubbornly intransigent, and you will need to use your gentle Virgo talents in communication to persuade and cajole this person into seeing your point of view. If you feel deadlocked, wait a little—this aspect is due to Mars still at the tail end of an opposition to Pluto, a holdover from May 20 and still influential until June 6. Open a new conversation after the first week of June.</p>
<p>Your attention could easily shift to your career after the new moon arrives June 17. This moment will mark one of the most important points of this year to bring you fresh opportunities and new ventures to consider. Neptune will be in hard angle to the Sun and new moon, however, so you may misunderstand, not be told what you will be expected to do, or not be aware of all the ramifications of joining the venture. Neptune is known to throw a veil over reality, making everything look soft and pretty, but hard to see details.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>Sometimes having Neptune in a position like this can make a job opportunity appear glitterier and more special than it really is. It would be best to go slowly and ask many questions—don’t jump into a new offer without doing some research. Colleagues (agent, manager, business partner, spouse, and so forth) won’t be much help—they may be blinded by the money you will make, of which, through commission or fee, they will partake, too.</p>
<p>With Saturn square the Sun, the job would be quite responsible, so you would be taking on a weighty position. Whether you take it or not depends on what else is going on in your life—you may have the time and eagerness to take it on, despite the weighty responsibility, in which case you should. However, let’s say you have a new baby or need to move house soon. In that case, you might want to take a job that still gives you a step up but at the same time doesn’t apply more pressure on you. It is clear your work and focus on your career last year (August 2022 through March 2023) has impressed higher-ups, and they will speak well of you behind the scenes.</p>
<p>If you write, speak, persuade, negotiate, edit, or write code for a living, you are on the right track this month for a job you would like, and that includes public relationships, marketing, social media, arbitration, sales, app and software development, or one of the other related communication arts. Jupiter and Saturn will work together this month to help you get on the short list of applicants to talk to further—VIPs will be impressed with you.</p>
<p>Clearly you are the more qualified applicant—your aim must be to express your desire for the job, offer your ideas, and show higher-ups why you’d be a perfect leader and team player. When you want something badly enough, with your talent in speaking and writing, you can run rings around the competition. Good energy attracts more good energy, dear Virgo—so if you want it, and you have taken the time and done your thorough research on the job, then go for the gold.</p>
