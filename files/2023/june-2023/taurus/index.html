        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>Life has not been easy for you because a series of eclipses in Taurus and your opposite sign of Scorpio have been coming by every six months since November 19, 2021. Eclipses always fall on a new or full moon, and they are very powerful—they have the strength of three new or full moons rolled into one. The most recent eclipse arrived as a solar eclipse on April 19, 2023, and was mainly friendly. Two weeks later, as is usual, we had a full moon lunar eclipse on May 5, 2023. As a fixed sign, dear Taurus, every bone in your body urges you to maintain the present structure of your life, but if the eclipse touched the degrees of your birthday Sun, or another planet in your chart, you had to understand that change had arrived, and you had little choice but to accept it and adjust.</p>
<p>Two recent eclipses were among the most difficult I had seen in a long time—the one last month May 5, 2023, and the one late last year on November 8, 2022.The part that made these two eclipses rattle many Taurus readers was due to the strong role Uranus, planet of wild and unexpected outcomes, played in both eclipses. If you felt either of those two eclipses, the news was likely completely suddenly out of left field because that is how Uranus works.</p>
<p>The eclipses are over, and if you noticed news last month (or in April near April 5), you may be dealing with some of the residue from the changes one or more of the eclipses wrought.</p>
<p>Additionally, if your birthday falls near May 5 (within five days) and you did not hear news last month, there is still a chance you might notice news of the May 5 eclipse on the full moon June 3 (plus five days). For about 15 percent of readers who would be affected, the message of the full moon lunar eclipse in May will be delivered one month later on or near the full moon in June, the range of influence being from June 3 to June 8. In addition to readers born May 5, plus or minus five days, would also be included readers who have a natal planet at 15 degrees Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, or Aquarius—those were the four signs most challenged (or if you have natal planets in those signs at or near 15 degrees).</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>If you have natal planets in Virgo, Capricorn, Cancer, or Pisces within five degrees of 15 degrees, even if you experienced troublesome news, you will ultimately benefit from the May 5 eclipse.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at June. This month will have a much larger than usual focus on money. The full moon of June 3 (not an eclipse) will fall in Sagittarius, 13 degrees, causing a financial matter to come to fullness. It may involve a bonus, commission, royalty, or insurance policy payout if you sent in a claim, or you could experience a settlement to a divorce or court case. Or you may receive severance, unemployment insurance, an inheritance, or other types of funds that would come to you outside of flat salary in your paycheck. Saturn will be in hard angle to the Sun and full moon, so you may have to pay a certain bill that’s due (or possibly even a bit late) but is hard to do.</p>
<p>The planets surrounding this full moon will not be getting along with each other. Many planets will be gathering in Taurus, your identity sector, and Pluto in Aquarius and Mars in Leo will be locking horns with each other, intent on riling up the planets in Taurus. This particular configuration will be putting pressure on a partnership—romantic or business—so it would behoove you to consult with him or her before moving forward with any large decision.</p>

        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>Your eighth house, where this full moon will land, also rules surgery, and if you need an operation, you may have decided to have the procedure done now. Mars will beam lovely rays to the full moon June 3 and be in tight friendly angle to the Sun. This will help your recovery—the Sun is the giver of gifts and strength, and the full moon is in your house ruling surgery, transformation, and other people’s money (such as payments from your health insurance provider, which may cover the cost of a health procedure entirely).</p>
<p>Still, this is a good month. Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, traveling cordially with long-term Saturn, indicates the decisions you are making now will likely bring you closer to a dream of yours that may involve a new home of your own or the chance to purchase special items you want in order to make life easier and more vibrant. Watch, in particular, June 19 when Jupiter and Saturn will make an exact alignment—the only time in 2023 this will happen! You will feel this aspect all month (because both move slowly and are within significant mathematical closeness), but I will admit, June 19 will be special for you to make any long-range decision or commitments.</p>
<p>Let’s backtrack two days. We find the theme of money management (from the full moon) continuing with the new moon of June 17 in Gemini at 27 degrees. The difference is that this time you will get a chance to find new revenue streams. A new moon almost always points to a fresh start, not an ending, so you will have a chance to negotiate for a raise or to be paid by someone who has owed you money. You may also find ways to streamline your outgo so that you save more money. There will be some crosscurrents at this new moon, so not everything will be a piece of cake, but you will have a chance to make financial progress. The problem planet will be Neptune, known to create fog and confuse the details of any deal. If you say to yourself, “Wait, this sounds too good to be true!” it probably will be, with trap doors that you may not initially see.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>Now let’s turn to a sparkling and rare aspect involving Mars and your ruler Venus, both moving through your fourth house of home and family, the elegant sign of Leo. This is an area of your life you could be hoping to improve. You might want to find and move into a sunny new space, own your first house, rent a vacation home, renovate your kitchen, or dress up the décor of your present space—any of these options would be a worthy goal.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may be thinking about a family member and want to find a way to care for that beloved person and improve that person’s life by giving financial help—you can do that now, too, and find workable solutions. Home and family will be areas of warmth in June, so at the very least, you might want to give a small, or even a large, party at home, and Venus will help to make it beautiful. Or you may want to simply cook a great meal for your partner at home for just the two of you—home is where love will flourish.</p>
<p>I should let you know now that Venus, your ruler, will soon retrograde, from July 22 to September 3 (which is the day before Labor Day in the US). That will encompass 44 days, so you might want to plan for this retrograde by getting as many things done as possible this month first.</p>
<p>During Venus retrograde, starting next month on July 22, don’t schedule any radical changes to your appearance. Instead, make your appointments now to see your dermatologist (for Botox or fillers), your hair stylist or barber, or cosmetic dentist. You will need to stay away from making these improvements to your appearance while Venus is retrograde because Venus is all about your face and good looks. Venus is also associated with everything that embellishes your life—fine food, wine, imported chocolates, spa visits, perfumes, precious gems, and luxury events. None of these will deliver the pleasure that you anticipate while Venus naps in retrograde.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>Venus is also about having fun, so from July 22 to September 3 don’t give a lavish party or charity benefit (charitable donations will be lower than expected because Venus is associated with money, too). Instead, keep things simple. You are fortunate that your ruler does not retrograde that often—only every 18 months. Your neighbor Gemini, next door on the horoscope wheel, is ruled by Mercury, which goes retrograde every 12 weeks for a three-week period. By comparison you are lucky.</p>
<p>When Venus is retrograde, you won’t have the usual favor that your ruler gives you, so it would be best not to date someone new (Venus rules love). If you are already attached, going out with your steady partner would be fine. It is not the best time for an engagement or wedding, though, for you would be building Venus retrograde into the DNA of your new relationship. It’s also not the right time to launch a new business project (as said earlier, Venus is tied to money and profits).</p>
<p>On June 11, Pluto will retreat back into Capricorn (away from Aquarius), which should benefit you until he returns to Aquarius on January 20, 2024. Pluto, as he backs out of Aquarius, can cause stress for any Taurus born at the end of April, so your outlook for June, after this date and for the rest of 2023 should improve quite a bit.</p>
<p>As you get closer to the end of June, you will start to feel the coming full moon in Capricorn on July 3 (influential for a plus or minus five days). This will be a very happy full moon and could send you on a wonderous, long-distance trip. Capricorn is an earth sign (like Taurus), so consider a mountainous setting with thick woods, yet one that provides quite a view. This full moon will blend perfectly with your Taurus Sun, so find a way to enjoy it.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Last month you had a full moon lunar eclipse on May 5 that may have shocked or worried you regarding the behavior of a romantic partner or one close business partner or collaborator. If the universe deemed that alliance weak or in need of immediate attention, the eclipse would have presented you with the information. It is very possible that person is now showing their true colors, and if he or she had a hidden agenda, it was revealed.</p>
<p>Sometimes an eclipse will deliver its news one month later (which would be the case now on or within days of June 3) or one month earlier (which would have been April 5). All these dates are full moons, so it appears a matter in the relationship is reaching critical mass, and it can no longer be ignored. Alternatively, you may have lost a beloved relative or pet. Sometimes eclipses can be exceptionally difficult, and this last one was a hard one. I am so sorry to transmit this to you.</p>
<p>As you begin June, planets are squaring off—Pluto, Jupiter, and Mars—each close to 90 degrees from one another—and that spells tension. All these planets are on the “key angles” of your chart: Jupiter in your first house, ruling your personality and identity; Pluto in your tenth house of career progress fueling your ambition; and Mars in your fourth house of home, suggesting there’s work to be done there, either for your own home or on behalf of a family member (most likely a parent). This pattern suggests that the desires you have in each of these areas have to be integrated into a whole rather than be addressed separately.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>Let’s say you get a job offer that you’re excited to accept, but doing so would require you to move to a new location. That would immediately put a pressing consideration on the needs and desires of your immediate family, possibly including the needs of an aging parent and your desire to oversee your parent’s care.</p>
<p>Despite the emphasis on home and family, professional progress, and your own dreams and desires, the full moon of June 3 will also put money at the core of discussion. The area of your chart being lit is your eighth house of other people’s money. This house rules money that goes out (such as taxes, mortgage payments, student loans, and credit card debt) and money that comes into you that is outside of salary (bonuses, commissions, royalties, prize money, gifts, tax refunds, inheritances, or insurance payouts as some possibilities).</p>
<p>As an example, if you need to move, you may be selling your current space while buying or renting a new one, which would likely include putting in an application with your bank for a mortgage or home improvement loan. If you accept a new job, you may be in talks about company benefits, like health insurance and vacation days, flex time, and possibly a year-end bonus.</p>
<p>When you have what’s known as a T-square, like the one shaping up at the full moon June 3, the house without a planet (in your case, the seventh house of close committed relationships) will get the main brunt of the energy. That suggests you will need to listen to your partner (or ex-partner) before making a decision. The universe applies pressure so that you will come to a conclusion and move forward, even if you don’t feel ready to do so or don’t like what is happening. At times like these we must face reality and be practical. This is how the universe creates progress.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>You will have an opportunity to earn good money as soon as you reach the new moon in Gemini, your second house, on June 17. You need to be careful that you are hearing what is being said and not what you hope you are being told. You may mistakenly assume a deal sounds good but is not—hearing what you hope to hear—but if you remain realistic and avoid high-level risks, you can do well.</p>
<p>Mercury rules your second house of income, and at the new moon Mercury will receive warm messages from both Venus and Mars. This suggests you may receive money from the sale of property (including anything you own, such as clothing or jewelry, along with furniture, a house, condo, or land) or from family, possibly coming in the form of a generous cash gift for your birthday or a family loan to help you bridge expenses until your situation improves.</p>
<p>Jupiter moved into Taurus for the first time in 12 years on May 16 and is set to stay until next year, May 25, 2024. You are in a rare period of reward and increasingly will find yourself at the right place at the right time to take advantage of a lucky break. You will be especially fortunate when it comes to enjoying distant travel, seeing advances in career and money, and expanding your circle of friendships. It’s just the start of a golden 12 months for you.</p>
