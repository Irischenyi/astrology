        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>This month starts out with a gorgeous full moon on June 3 in fun-loving Sagittarius, 13 degrees, and it seems you have a special event on your agenda over the beautiful first weekend of June 3-4. All full moons have an extra five days of influence as the full moon wanes, so your event might take place as late as June 8.</p>
<p>You may be attending a party, reunion, a pal’s wedding, baby shower, or a weekend getaway with friends at a rented cottage. The event seems to draw many happy people together, possibly from a wide number of international countries. Alternatively, this event might express the traditions of one of your friend’s ethnic backgrounds (Sagittarius is associated with foreign cultures), so you may be going to an authentic wedding of a couple from India that’s taking place in your country. Or you might set off on a trip to New York City to enjoy the sights and a Broadway show, or you could simply meet up with a group of your friends to go to a Thai or Mexican restaurant.</p>
<p>Mars in Leo will be very friendly to this full moon, so if you have a romantic partner, he or she will be enthusiastic about coming with you, even if your partner doesn’t always feel that way. You both would have a lot of fun. This is quite a joyous weekend for you.</p>
<p>There will be one caveat—taskmaster Saturn will be in a hard, square angle to the Sun, so whatever you do, you will want to watch how much money you spend over this weekend. Aquarius loves apps, so I bet you have an app to track your credit card expenditures and a banking app that reports withdrawals—both can be a big help to stay in control.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>Aquarians born on February 2, plus or minus five days, will be the ones most strongly touched by this full moon. The same is true if you have Aquarius rising at 13 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. If you have a natal planet at 13 degrees, plus or minus five degrees, in Aquarius, Libra, Gemini, Aries, Leo, or Sagittarius, that planet will light up for you because it will be energized by this full moon.</p>
<p>You have more happy news because June is meant to be all about enlarging the fun in your personal life.</p>
<p>The new moon in Gemini, 27 degrees, on June 17 will light your fifth house of true love and is sure to add vibrancy to your love life. If you are single, this is very good news, for you will enter a period where meeting a new romantic interest will be very possible. If you are attached, you will be able to give more attention to your partner and have more time to go out and enjoy life together. This same area of your chart rules pregnancy, birth, and the care of children, so you may have discussions about having a new baby or how to best care for the one or more children you have now.</p>
<p>Again, money will be a consideration but not because of Saturn’s influence. Instead, it’s due to Neptune, which is in the same area of your chart, your second house of income and possessions, and will be in conflict with the new moon and the Sun. You will need to watch how much you spend.</p>
<blockquote><p>The new moon in Gemini on June 17 will light your fifth house of true love and is sure to add vibrancy to your love life. If you are single, this is very good news</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>There is another way Neptune can affect you. When in hard angle to the Sun and new moon based in your fifth house of love, Neptune can make you idealistic but not realistic about a new love interest—you may lift your new sweetheart onto a lofty pedestal and assign all kinds of wonderful attributes to your partner that aren’t quite accurate.</p>
<p>It is natural to assume the best about the person we are smitten with. It is easy to trust our feelings and make what we think are reasonable assumptions about someone we don’t know very well. We do this by what I call “filling in the blanks” (the areas we don’t know about). However, this is how you can go down the wrong road, which is sure to bring disillusionment in the end. The only way to prevent problems is to get to know your romantic interest before you become deeply involved.</p>
<p>There is good news, too—Mercury will have the last word on how things go with this new moon on June 17 and the following weeks it will influence. Mercury will be in compatible Gemini and will be perfectly in sync with Venus and Mars, both in congenial Leo. This is great—if you meet someone intriguing, you can proceed. Just resist the urge to go forward quickly. Take your time, get to know your partner’s friends, and enjoy the thrill. There is no reason to rush.</p>
<p>If your birthday falls on February 16, plus or minus five days (and thereby affecting some early-born Pisces),you will feel this new moon, and in the coming weeks, you will likely benefit from the flurry of social activity and the heartwarming effects of genuine and lasting love and affection due to the appearance of this new moon. The same is true if you have Aquarius rising at 27 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. Also look to see if you have a natal moon or planet within degrees of 27 degrees of Gemini, Libra, Aquarius, Aries, Leo, or Sagittarius.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>If you are living with your sweetheart in a long-term, serious, and established relationship or if you are married, you have excellent news. Not only will the new moon on June 17 help you, but alluring Mars and Venus will, too. Here is the scoop.</p>
<p>This month Mars will be in Leo, a sign compatible with yours. It is a sign Mars entered on May 20 and will continue to tour until July 10. Mars is currently brightening your committed relationship and marriage sector (seventh house). It is well known that Mars always longs to be with his lover Venus, but because these two planets have very different orbits, they can rarely be together.</p>
<p>However, the beautiful news is that Venus is due to arrive in Leo on June 5 and will remain in that constellation until October 8, a very long time for Venus. (I will get back to that to tell you why her stay will be so long in a minute.) Although Venus and Mars will not make an exact conjunction this month (that has to wait until February 22, 2024, when they conjoin in your sign, Aquarius), these two cosmic lovebirds will be close enough to be mathematically significant in astrology—from June 5 on, they will be within four to five tiny degrees of each other. That’s fantastic!</p>
<p>Both Venus and Mars will be in Leo, your marriage and commitment seventh house, and will add a touch of happiness and pure joy to your life. If you are attached and happy, I want to urge you to plan something—any event—to celebrate your love for your partner. I particularly like Saturday, June 17 for your festive night out.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>Now let’s talk about your home and family situation. You may have decided you need to move or renovate since you have been hosting Uranus in your house of home and family since 2018 (the preview time—Uranus has been more permanently settled here since March 2019). Moving or renovating can be hard, especially if news comes that you would have no choice but to find a new place, redo a kitchen or bath, or make other repairs suddenly without any notice. If your physical home has not been your focus, then you may have been thinking about and finding ways to financially help a family member, such as a parent or one of your children.</p>
<p>Now the universe must feel guilty that it may have given you a hard time with this tender area of home and family and is set to bring abundant rewards to this part of your life.</p>
<p>Here is a delightful bit of information: This month a very rare aspect will come up on June 19 that will only happen once in 2023 and then not again for several years. It will involve the friendly collaboration between good-fortune Jupiter and teacher Saturn.</p>
<p>Both Jupiter and Saturn are slow-moving planets, so you will feel the glow of this aspect all month, not only on June 19. Here’s what is so exciting. For the first time in 12 years, benefic Jupiter entered your home sector last month on May 16. The very area that may have brought you tension and concern about, namely, your home or family, will now be the area of your greatest growth, luck, and happiness. Jupiter, now in your home and family sector, will stay here until May 25, 2024. You have such a wonderful outlook to make your home all you hoped it to be and to also help a family member, if you have been thinking about that.</p>
<p>The part that is so remarkable is that Saturn is currently in Pisces, your salary and earned income sector, and is tightly collaborating with Jupiter.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>You may be saving up for your first house or condo, or if you have already bought a home, you might want to trade up to a bigger one (or downsize to a smaller one). You could also decide to buy a vacation cottage in a beautiful location not too far from home so you can visit it frequently.</p>
<p>If property is not on your wish list, you may be looking for a way to get a dear family member proper care and relief from the stress he or she might be suffering from. The universe will work with you now to find a workable and affordable answer that you will like.</p>
<p>Take this five-star aspect seriously because the decisions you make while Saturn and Jupiter are working together in June and early July will bring you long-lasting effects, giving you a sustained and comforting sense of financial security. I have pointed to buying, repairing, or fixing up property or acquiring additional real estate because Jupiter is in the house that rules these matters.</p>
<p>If you want to buy a house, experts are saying that although the interest rates are very high, get into the market anyway because later, when interest rates drop, you can renegotiate your loan with the bank. Experts are saying you will receive the widest selection of properties to buy now—but later, when interest rates fall, bidding wars for houses and condos will be much tougher, and prices for the houses and condos will rise. This is something to think about because, as an Aquarius, you are the single best sign for finding good luck in the real estate market. (Note: Always consult a professional real estate agent.)</p>
<p>Before I go, I want to urge you to accomplish as much as you can in June because next month Venus will go retrograde from July 22 to September 3.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>Venus rules love, beauty, luxury, parties, and pampering, and all these areas go bland and lackluster when Venus naps. Venus also rules money and products and services devoted to women (Mars is more male oriented), so this would not be the time to launch anything directed at women.</p>
<p>The first point I want to make is that you should not schedule any plastic surgery, a face lift, Botox, or fillers during Venus retrograde. Top dermatologists are in high demand and are usually hard to get an appointment with, even if you are a regular customer. If you were thinking of going in for a treatment during the period of July 22 to September 3 (the day prior to Labor Day in the US), I suggest you call right away to reschedule before all the appointment availabilities have been snapped up. (Although Venus is more associated with your face, I say avoid liposuction, too.)</p>
<p>Do not change your hair color or haircut dramatically during Venus retrograde, and men, don’t shave off or grow a beard during this retrograde. Keep to the status quo. Venus is very involved with how you look, but you may not like the results when Venus withholds her powers while retrograde. (Regular trims and good grooming are always OK—I would never want you to be a little ragamuffin.)</p>
<p>If you are single, avoid starting a new relationship with Venus retrograde embedded into the birth of the relationship. Affection is likely to cool off too quickly, leaving you wondering why you became involved in the first place. Married and Aquarian readers in long-term relationships will not be affected by Venus retrograde, only those single and looking for a new romantic partner.</p>
<p>Never come too close to the start and end dates of a retrograde planet. (For example, with Venus, keep a distance of a few days from before July 22 and after September 3.)</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>Here is an important point I want to make. In ONLY Aquarian charts, Venus rules the solar fourth sector of home and family, so decisions made between July 22 and September 3 would not be as favorable for you regarding property. Venus also rules money, so this is not the time to decide on ways to financially help a relative. Venus only retrogrades every 18 months for a six-week stay, so you won’t run into this again anytime soon.) July is not the month to focus on home and property—June is.</p>
<p>This month is when Jupiter and Saturn will be in ideal sync, peaking in an elegant sextile on June 19, but this gorgeous five-star aspect will be influential all month. July does not have this advantage, but admittedly, you will have the help of Jupiter all the way until May 25, 2024.</p>
<p>I should add that the next Mercury retrograde will overlap with Venus retrograde, for Mercury will be out of phase from August 23 to September 15. We tend to not feel the outer planets when they retrograde, but we strongly feel the three planets that orbit closest to Earth: Mars, Venus, and Mercury. Luckily, Mars is in fine shape. As you see, Venus and Mercury are nearing a time when they will need to nap. Get things done now in June, and you can work in July too, up to July 15.</p>
<p>You have a sensational forecast.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>The full moon on June 3 could bring a joyous event involving one or more friends, such as a wedding, birthday party, or baby shower over this month’s first weekend.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>Life has not been easy for you over the last month, for the May eclipse has been bringing unexpected news to you, causing sudden rumblings. You may have felt as though the Earth was moving underneath your feet. Even if you were not directly affected (not likely, but if you escaped change), you would have had to take on more responsibility due to the departure of others, possibly at home (such as a nanny or housekeeper) or at work where you were undergoing enormous shifts.</p>
<p>Having a fun social event to look forward to over the weekend of June 3-4 would do you a world of good. If you don’t have an invitation, plan something you want to do.</p>
<p>You may be concerned about saving money because thrifty Saturn moved into your financial sector in March, and by now he’s making his presence known. Find a way to see your friends, and do so as economically as possible.</p>
<p>The tension you might notice will stem from planets in fixed signs, each taking up a position that is at odds with the others. Mars in Leo is in direct opposition to Pluto in Aquarius. Neither of these planets was friendly to the full moon lunar eclipse in Scorpio on May 5 either—the eclipse that brought news that a career matter was reaching a full point. That eclipse directly opposed Uranus in Taurus, which set off changes in not only your career but also your home or in regard to a family member, and you had no way to prepare for what you were hearing.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>The fixed signs of Aquarius, Taurus, Scorpio, and Leo are hardwired to retain and hold up the structures they have built or are responsible to maintain, and they are made to resist compromise. When these signs square off—they are called configurations of disharmony—they add so much pressure that they force change and break the deadlock of stagnation. This has been happening over recent weeks.</p>
<p>In June your ability to adapt to change (and even welcome it) will be the main theme. The bright spot in your life, dear Aquarius, will be in feeling the warmth of friendship and very possibly the joy that being in a loving romantic relationship can bring. (If you don’t have a romantic partner, the new moon on June 17 may bring a person into your life who intrigues you in the days that follow.)</p>
<p>Jupiter’s entry into the home and family area of your chart last month—to last through May 2024—will create a safe haven against the vicissitudes of life. Truly, for the rest of 2023, and part of 2024, home will be where your heart is found.</p>
<p>If you are seeking a solution for a parent, you will be able to find it. Despite recent jarring news regarding your home and family that may have come earlier this year and in years prior, good-fortune Jupiter has arrived and will help you manifest your heartfelt dream.</p>
<p>The best part of all is that Jupiter and Saturn will work together in rare collaboration all month and through to the first week of July helping you feel the kind of home-related security that you’ve worked toward for a long time. If you want to buy a home, June is a great time to look and to put in your bid. The long-range decisions about property or family you make now will turn out to bring you long-term financial security.</p>
<p>If you feel none of this applies to you because you can’t buy a house, I say this: There is a reason Jupiter is also called the planet of miracles.</p>
