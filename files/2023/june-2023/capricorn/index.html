        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>As you begin June, you seem to crave a period of soothing peacefulness with time to be alone, to think and reflect on recent events. The full moon on June 3 will appear in Sagittarius at 13 degrees in your twelfth house of privacy, and at this point, you don’t seem in the mood to travel. You appear interested in saving money, as lately your expenses have been heavy. Besides, being on the road in traffic or in a crowded airport won’t be your cup of tea in early June.</p>
<p>If you do go away, you might prefer going to a thickly wooded area near a lake set against tall mountains. A weekend relaxing in cool crisp air, taking in sunshine in a secluded setting where you would not likely run into anyone you know sounds good. A tiny pocket of privacy can be quite luxurious. You have been working hard and may feel a need to eliminate the stimulation of a busy life.</p>
<p>Also at this full moon, Mars will be in a strongly supportive position in your financial eighth house, so news of money soon to come may lift your spirits, for it will ease a possible cash flow problem. Saturn will be active too, but will present an obstacle from Saturn’s perch in your third house of agreements, so you may be temporarily at an impasse over a contractual matter that you have not been able to resolve. Saturn is your ruler, so the matter must be important to you. You can overcome obstacles, however, due to a very rare and gorgeous aspect that will happen this month. Here is the scoop.</p>
<p>Jupiter, planet of good fortune, and Saturn, the planet of long-range gain, will make a rare, friendly (sextile) configuration that suggests a coming breakthrough or opportunity. This is a sensational aspect, one that everyone of every sign will appreciate, but in many ways, you will benefit from it more because Saturn rules Capricorn and beneficial aspects that include Saturn are always weighted more heavily toward you. In this case, if you have a contractual negotiation that seems stuck, you can find an imaginative solution, for Jupiter is currently in your creative fifth house. This is the area of the chart that encourages the talent for thinking outside the box. Don’t be afraid to offer up an idea that seems new and untraditional.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>A quick moving new moon in breezy Gemini (June 17) will stimulate news about your work assignments as well as business. If you work in sales, or if you are self-employed, this would be an ideal time to pitch new clients. If you are looking to change jobs, this new moon could bring an offer. It would not represent a step up but rather a job similar to the one you had previously. That might be fine with you for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>For example, if you are taking on more responsibilities in your life, such as if you recently brought home a newborn baby, you might not feel you can handle more responsibility on the job, too. Or if you don’t like the atmosphere of your current job or didn’t get along well with your boss, a lateral shift to a new but similar type job may be exactly what you need. In that case, send out feelers for interviews. On the other hand, if you are looking for a part-time gig to supplement your present income, that would also be possible in the days and weeks that follow the new moon, June 17. With a new moon in Gemini, the sign of the Twins, you may get two offers or two assignments.</p>
<p>There is a problem with the new moon in that Neptune will be in a difficult position and could lead to your misunderstanding of the scope of work you will be expected to complete. Ask many questions and don’t make assumptions. By going the extra mile to be on the same page as the client (or your boss), you will save valuable time and not go over budget.</p>
<blockquote><p>With Jupiter in Taurus until May 2024, you can experience an artistic renaissance, find authentic love, have a baby, hear good news about a child you have now—or all of these!</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>The new moon of June 17 will fall in Gemini, 27 degrees, and could be the time you resolve a question about certain terms in a contractual agreement, if you have one on your desk. If you need a date to sign or start a new job, pick June 19. I should say that you will feel the boosting effect of Jupiter and Saturn all month, not just on June 19. These are two planets that move slowly, like little turtles in deep space, and thereby will stay within mathematical significance longer than faster moving planets. That means these two planets can spread their joyous gifts of financial luck, creativity, and longevity to you all month. Of course, you have to make an effort, but once you do, Jupiter and Saturn will be standing by to give you a big boost.</p>
<p>This all means that Jupiter will bubble up optimism and a broad range of possibilities, while Saturn will keep you from going over the top—continuously advising you to be realistic and practical too—which adds up to a winning combination of planetary energies. Jupiter is also always associated with money. This five-star aspect and major feature of 2023 will be become more noticeable after the appearance of the June 17 new moon.</p>
<p>Each planet brings the best of both worlds to you—realism and practicality on one hand, and vision and creativity on the other. Take this aspect seriously, for it will not repeat for many years, and when it does, next time Jupiter and Saturn will be in different positions and different constellations. As you see, this moment in time is unique and special. Saturn, the great teacher, can help you set a foundation on which you can build your future financial security.</p>
<p>With Mars in your eighth house, you’re spending will remain high, but that will simmer down once you get to July 10. Even a part time job could be welcome this month.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>The areas of greatest gain for you will involve writing, speaking, editing, or coding, for these areas are ruled by Gemini. You may be working on a manuscript for a book or screenplay, a scientific white paper, a report for your company, the design and code for a new digital game, a new app, the design of a new website, or the design of a digital e-book—there are many possibilities. Gemini also governs the travel business, including the automotive, rail, and aviation industries, as well as public relations, marketing, sales, and other areas of the communication arts. These areas will burn brilliantly for you, and they are about to grow even brighter in 2024.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to another topic: your ability to enjoy time off in the coming weeks. Let’s look.</p>
<p>It does not appear that you will be able to travel this month for a proper vacation, but your time is coming soon. When Mars tours fellow earth-sign Virgo from July 10 to August 27, that would be your best time to plan a trip. Within that time frame, my pick for you would be August 16—a Wednesday—so include this day within the time you take off. This will be an absolutely superb day for you to spread joy and fun to the days surrounding August 16. Three transiting planets in Virgo will be in sweet angle to Uranus, planet of surprise, making that week out of town heavenly.</p>
<p>Looking at the big picture, last month on May 16, Jupiter, giver of gifts and luck, moved into Taurus, your solar fifth house of true love, for the first time in 12 years. Best of all, Jupiter will remain in this part of your solar chart until next year, May 25, 2024. If you are single, this recent move of Jupiter to fellow earth-sign Taurus makes you and Taurus the two zodiac signs most likely to fall in love during the coming months. Here I am talking about real, genuine love, not a fling or a casual romance.</p>
<p>If you are already in love and attached or married, you can look forward to having more quality time and fun together, as Jupiter in Taurus will encourage you both to deepen your love and grow closer. As a Capricorn, you work hard, and now the universe wants you to take time to create a richer, private emotional life for yourself.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>The ancient astrologers devoted much of their writing to the subject of children regarding the fifth house, a house that rules love but also pregnancy, birth, and the care for your offspring. Many Capricorns will welcome a baby to their home sometime during this 12-month period. If you already have children, you will have more time—and more giggles—with them, too. It’s also likely that at least one of your children will make you proud during the coming months.</p>
<p>In the rare chance you are in the middle of a divorce and worried about the well-being of your children (perhaps due to a conflict over custody), keep in mind that you have Jupiter in the very best place to protect your children. Jupiter is the good-fortune planet, and it is also called the planet of miracles.</p>
<p>Anyone who has children knows that a parent always wants to help protect them, no matter their age. If your children are grown, life and time with them will expand and likely warm your heart.</p>
<p>If having children is not for you, this position of Jupiter will also work with you to help you develop an innate talent. In the coming months, and for a year until May 25, 2024, you have a stellar chance to create and show an important artistic project to the world. If you want to establish your name as an artist, now is your time to concentrate on your project with a powerful sense of purpose. If you are already established as an artist, and want to reach a new level of artistry and imagination, this coming period is yours to showcase all you can do.</p>
<p>All these areas are special and not mutually exclusive. You can experience an artistic renaissance, find authentic love, have a baby, hear good news about a child you have now—or all of these! You would have to work on each area to show the universe your intent. If you do, the universe will work with you to help you achieve your dream.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>Although June will find you mainly taking care of business much of the time (with some notable exceptions on certain sparkly days), you will find next month—July—will bring a big improvement to the overall mood and tempo of the month, giving you more time for romance and leisure.</p>
<p>As you get down to the last days of June, you will start to feel the growing energy of next month’s full moon, this time set to appear in Capricorn on July 3. Something of enormous personal importance will come to culmination within five days of this date. Jupiter will signal this full moon, making it a standout, and Jupiter’s involvement will make all the difference in this tailor-made-for-you full moon.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You seem anxious to get your life moving forward, but in April and May, planets created a few roadblocks. Last month you had an eclipse in Scorpio, your friendship sector, on May 5, and whatever came up seems to still be on your mind. (Sometimes an eclipse delivers its news almost exactly one month later, so news may arrive this month in the first week of June.) Your eleventh house rules friends, so you may have felt betrayed by a friend or not happy with the treatment you received from the leadership in a group you belong to, such as a professional or social club, charity, or community organization.</p>
<p>You are about to see a welcome contrast of circumstances. At first you may have received jarring news about a friend or person you were dating (or news involving one of your children) that knocked you sideways—eclipses always move us to action, quite unexpectedly. However, you have reason to be optimistic about how well you can turn things around. Jupiter entered your fifth house of love on May 16 to stay for a full year, so no matter what news the eclipse brought, keep the dream you have in your heart alive.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>Do not give up on grasping your dream that involves love, children, an artistic project, or regarding a friend. Be confident and optimistic, despite any disillusionment you may have felt when the eclipse arrived. Last month’s eclipse arrived May 5, but Jupiter had not yet arrived in the perfect place to help you yet—that happened May 16, and now Jupiter will help with all phases of your social life.</p>
<p>If you are creative, you may be working toward producing a special project. Jupiter is among the planets in your fifth house and will send luck to all these areas. Jupiter is like Santa Claus—always protective, always willing to shower you with gifts to spread happiness.</p>
<p>Switching attention to this month, June, you will quickly be greeted by the full moon in Sagittarius on June 3, which will find you craving rest and rejuvenation. Carve out a peaceful time to be alone so that you reflect on recent events. You might want to meditate or pray while you envision all the things you want to create in your life. Early June will not be a period to do anything strenuous—you should aim for some time of soothing calm.</p>
<p>Your life will certainly be bursting with activity after the new moon of June 17 arrives, when a new project will keep you very busy. You may be working on a writing, speaking, or editing project because the new moon of June 17 will be in Gemini, the sign of the journalist. Gemini is also the sign of the Twins, the reason why you are likely to get two important assignments at nearly the same time.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>Neptune will toss a veil over everything—pretty, but a softened picture of reality can obscure underlying details, and facts can be confusing. It will be vital that you clearly understand the steps you will be expected to take to create a successful project, one that your client or management wants. You might want to write a summary of your understanding of the project and get it approved by your boss or client.</p>
<p>Do you need to go on a perfect vacation? Plan it for the time between July 20 and August 27. Your very best week within that period will include Wednesday, August 16—a fabulous day when everything will seem to go right. Best of all, that day will spread its charms to all the surrounding days, making that week sparkle for you.</p>
<p>As you get close to the very end of June, you will start to sense something of great importance to you reaching a culmination point. This comes thanks to the approaching full moon in Capricorn, due July 3. It’s a sweet one, for benefic Jupiter will be active, so good news is due. You have every reason to feel hopeful!</p>
