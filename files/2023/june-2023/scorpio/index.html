        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>Your life is full of change, and each day may look and feel different from the day before. As a fixed sign, you would prefer to either keep things as is or have time to carefully plan for change, but life doesn’t always work that way. The eclipses have been coming in pairs every six months since November 19, 2021 (as triple-powerful new moons and full moons) in the signs of Scorpio and your opposite sign of Taurus. Some of the eclipses in this series have made you adjust instantly to fast-moving conditions.</p>
<p>The eclipses in the Scorpio-Taurus family were unusually strong because other planets circulating in the solar system, many of which were also in fixed signs, were not in friendly positions to the eclipses or to your own Scorpio planets. As a result, you were forced to adjust—instantly—to rattling news.</p>
<p>Of all the eclipses in the series, the full moon eclipse in Scorpio last month on May 5 was particularly tough because news came out of left field. Another eclipse that came last year on November 8, 2022—a lunar full moon eclipse in Taurus—highlighted your partnerships of all kinds, from marriage to business associates.</p>
<p>Readers whose birthdays fall in the first week of November were doubly sensitive to thesetwo eclipses. If you have Scorpio rising at 15 degrees, you likely felt vast changes from one or both of these eclipses, too. Scorpios and those with Scorpio rising should not feel singled out. A series of eclipses all fall in different degrees, so everyone within one sign is likely to feel one or two of the eclipses directly.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>Only one more eclipse in this Taurus-Scorpio series is due—it is coming on October 28 as a full moon lunar eclipse. I feel you are likely to benefit from the events brought by this eclipse as good-fortune Jupiter will be orbiting very close to the full moon on October 28 in Taurus. This eclipse will be much friendlier than the earlier one, and you might like the effects very much. So as you see, you are almost done. The new series of eclipses are moving to Aries-Libra (the first one was a solar eclipse in Aries this year on April 19). The next one will fall in Libra as a new moon solar eclipse on October 14, so you’re nearly finished with the Taurus-Scorpio series. Eclipses tend to return to a family of signs everynine years.</p>
<p>In truth, all eclipses are our friends. They insist on moving us to stronger, more productive relationships and situations, although as we are going through them, we don’t always see their value immediately, especially when news is presented suddenly (which is an eclipse’susual method). Eclipses look for weak links, and when they find one, they zero in and present their evidence to you instantly. New moon solar eclipses open new doors, and full moon lunar eclipses bring a finish or culmination, for in the case of a full moon lunar eclipse, there is no more to be learned or benefitted from a situation—you are ready to move on.</p>
<p>Now as you enter June you are still working on the changes that have been afoot since late April.</p>

        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>This month will have a strong focus on money management. You will see this to be true on or within five days of the full moon on June 3 in Sagittarius, 13 degrees, set to light your earned income sector (second house). You may ask for a raise (an excellent time to do so), or you might be paying bills, filling out paperwork, if you are joining a company as an employee for a new job, or you could make an important purchase, such as a car. Alternatively, you may be changing your status to self-employed, perhaps starting a corporation, for example. If you recently wed, you might want to take out a new joint bank account that you would both contribute to on a monthly basis, or you may change one or two credit cards.</p>
<p>Mars, one of your two rulers, will be beautifully supportive of your efforts to organize your finances in the most beneficial way possible. You may want to set up a retirement account, or if you already have one, you could call your broker to see if any changes would improve the performance of your retirement or investment portfolio. Mars will link the money you are working with to your career because Mars is currently in Leo, your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement, and the full moon is in your house of earned income. All or most of your actions may be linked to things going on in your career.</p>
<p>Saturn is based in Pisces, your fifth house of love and children, and will be in harsh (square) angle to both the Sun in Gemini and the full moon in Sagittarius. This suggests that you will feel the weight of responsibility to care for your children’s future. That may lead you this month to open a special bank account for your child’s college fund, save up for special lessons to develop his or her talent, or give your child a tutor to help with a subject he or she is struggling with. If you don’t have a last will and testament, this month would be the right time to have it done. This is also a favorable time for estate planning.</p>
<p>This month’s new moon in Gemini comes on June 17, and many of the same matters are covered by your eighth house of other people’s money. You may be setting up a commission or royalty agreement, applying for a mortgage, or filing a claim to your insurance company, as some examples.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>There’s a problem with this new moon—Neptune will be in hard angle to the new moon and the Sun, both in Gemini, 27 degrees. Neptune can cause a misunderstanding or create confusion, for Neptune is known to fog details, and when dealing with financial matters, that can be problematic. If you have to sign papers, you will have to see your accountant and lawyer to go over all the language in the contract with a fine-tooth comb to clarify the clauses and add any necessary provisions that were left out in error.</p>
<p>I would prefer you attend to most of your key financial matters early in June prior to this new moon only because you would have to overcome Neptune’s static for clarity (necessary in all legal documents). You can—you need a lawyer’s help.</p>
<p>Yet there is a five-star aspect coming, which is a rare feature of 2023, and it will be quite a blessing for setting up financial programs.</p>
<p>I love that you are doing financial planning in June for there is a rare and very special conjunction that will take place on June 19 that will affect the entire month. Jupiter in Taurus and Saturn in Pisces will make a rare sextile (opportunity) aspect that will only happen once this year on June 19 and not again for several years.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>Jupiter is the good-fortune planet, and Saturn is the great stabilizer known to bring long-term gain and profits once you set up the right structure. (Saturn rules structures of all kinds.) Jupiter and Saturn are magical when in combination. Both are very slow-moving planets, so they will be within significant mathematical closeness throughout June and during the early part of July. If you have bills you want to begin to pay down, this aspect will allow you to move mountains. If you have any financial goal, start now, for you can reach it with care and a disciplined approach.</p>
<p>Thanks to fortunate Jupiter working closely with teacher Saturn, the decisions and actions you make in your financial world in June can bring long-term profits. The kind of security you’ve always dreamed you would have will now be within your grasp.</p>
<p>This month also accents your career, since Mars, your ruler, is in Leo, your most prestigious sector (solar tenth house) for your professional life, ruling honors, awards, and achievement. Remarkably, Venus, Mars’ sweetheart, is also moving into Leo on June 5 and will be orbiting with him in a lovely dance across the star-studded skies this month.</p>
<p>Mars and Venus adore being together but are rarely able to do so because they have very different orbits, and the universe sends them to divergent constellations on distinctassignments. All they can normally do is gaze at one another across the midnight skies and hope to someday be close again. That will happen in June. Venus and Mars won’t make an exact conjunction in June (not until February 22 next year), but the good news is that Mars and Venus will be within four to five tiny degrees of each other in your tenth house of career success for weeks.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>What is the result of Venus and Mars being in close orbit to each other? You will be loved by your company, your industry, and possibly the world at large. VIPs will admire you, and subordinates will want to work for you.</p>
<p>You can do no wrong, so take the outstanding support you will be given from higher-ups seriously. It is precious energy that does not come often—be grateful for all the faith others have in you. You are poised to create great things, and soon your name may be in lights.</p>
<p>You might ask, what about love? If you are single, once Mars moves into Virgo next month on July 10, you will have all the social activity you could ever wish to see—be patient. (The kind of career aspects you have now are the envy of the zodiac, so concentrate on your professional advancement.)</p>
<p>Additionally, ever since Jupiter entered Taurus on May 16, you suddenly became the sign most likely to wed between now and May 25, 2024. Of course, that is only possible if you have been dating someone seriously. If you are already wed, you will see your partner do exceedingly well. That means you will have options as a couple that you’ve not had previously, and together you can work on a life goal, such as buying a house, having a baby, or taking a long trip of a lifetime (as three examples).</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>Saturn is now in your fifth house of true love and will be signaling Jupiter (as mentionedearlier) in your house of marriage—love, in your case, leads to marriage. (That is not true for everyone, I am sad to say.) This aspect will help you establish a loving, stable relationship on which to build your life.</p>
<p>If you are not interested in marriage, you can use this new energy being brought to you by benefic Jupiter in your seventh house of partnership to develop a solid and profitable business relationship with a colleague. Some examples include finding a new business partner, agent, accountant, or lawyer. You may connect with the perfect real estate broker, wedding planner, or any other business collaborator who would be thought of as equal to you (working as an expert) and work with you in a confidential one-to-one way. With Jupiter shining in your collaboration and marriage house, this person will be a source of great luck, profit, and happiness.</p>
<p>Dear Scorpio, accomplish as much as you can this month. Next month, Venus will go retrograde from July 22 to September 3. Venus rules love, romance, beauty and pampering (like the way you’re treated at a spa), and also gems, fine dinners, and parties of all kinds—in short, the fun in life. When Venus sleeps for six weeks, we all have to be patient for life gets a little less exciting until Venus awakens and begins to beam her generous gifts to us.</p>
<p>If you are single, it is not wise to start a new relationship while Venus is retrograde as you would not want to build this aspect into the birth of your relationship. Your feelings for each other may cool off in time, and a relationship without warmth and affection is not a good one to be in.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>You should not schedule a face lift, plastic surgery, Botox, fillers, or cosmetic dentistry during Venus retrograde from July 22 to September 3. (Always leave an extra space of days before and after the official dates of the retrograde.) Do not ask your stylist for a new hair style or color. Men, put off growing your beard or shaving yours off during Venus retrograde. Keep things as they are. (Regular, small changes like having a trim, for example, are fine.)</p>
<p>Venus is associated with money and profits, and doubly so if you have a product or service directed to women. (Venus has a strong association with women, just as Mars is strongly associated with men.) Do not plan a product launch or a charity benefit during Venus retrograde. If you want to host a big, lavish party, wait until after the retrograde. I am trying to give you advanced notice so you can prepare.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you have a dazzling month ahead, so enjoy it dear Scorpio. Use June to your full benefit!</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Last month was not an easy month because there was a major lunar eclipse on May 5 in Scorpio, and whatever news you received will still be lingering in your mind. You may also be scrambling to find answers. This news may have involved a close collaborator or romantic partner—someone you think of as an equal and who helps you in daily life, personally or professionally. An eclipse often will “eclipse out” someone important to you in your life—a favorite boss who protected and nurtured your career or a romantic partner you truly cared for—life has a way of turning things upside down when we least expect it to happen.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>You are ruled by both Mars and Pluto, and Mars made a decisive opposition to Pluto last month on May 20, showing a separation of sorts was happening, possibly beyond your control. Fortunately, Mars is slowly moving away from his 180-degree tug-of-war with Pluto, and the tension will be drained away by June 6.</p>
<p>All this month (and in early July) Venus will be orbiting close to Mars in your prestigious tenth house of career advancement, and both planets will see that you are regarded enthusiastically by higher-ups. At the same time, Mars will be touring Leo, an excellent place for Mars to be because Mars will give you access to high-level people in your career—you will have no trouble connecting with the most influential people you need to meet.</p>
<p>The full moon on June 3 may find you focused on money, and if you speak up, your aspects are excellent for earning a great deal more. You may receive a raise or offer for a new job that will pay you more generously. If you are self-employed, you may decide to raise your rates. Mars is in your solar tenth house of prestigious career advancement and recognition and will send a beautiful beam to the full moon in your salary sector, indicating money appears to be on the way to you, provided you speak up.</p>
<p>More financial matters will come up for discussion on the new moon on June 17. Within five days of this date, you may be thinking about company benefits, bank loans, setting up a new bank account for you or your child, or other money gained outside of your regular income. Again, nothing will seem as easy as pie. Mars in your prestigious career sector (tenth house) will be in hard angle to Uranus, the planet of unexpected developments, so there will be obstacles to sort out with any financial matter you are working on.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>If you are trying to divide marriage assets due to a divorce, you need to view your partner as prone to being unpredictable. The period between June 17 and June 26 may bring up an unexpected difficulty that will require you to display strength, fortitude, and grace, and to be at your most resourceful. Always aim for the fair and just answer. Also, strive for claritybecause Neptune will add the fog of confusion.</p>
<p>Despite the wild and wooly environment of that aspect in June, you do have one stabilizing vibration on June 19 when Jupiter and Saturn send each other friendly energy beams. Saturn is in your fifth house, ruling true and genuine love, children, and creativity and will have a direct line to Jupiter in your partnership sector. All of these areas will be helped, improved, or protected.</p>
<p>Yet this rare aspect between Jupiter and Saturn will not be repeated anytime soon. I love this aspect, for it will help you in many ways this month, especially in helping you stabilize your financial picture so that you will be poised to pay down any bills and build your wealth. Decisions you make in June can start you on a path where you will grow your profits for many years. You have an excellent chance to create financial security.</p>
<p>While you may feel like you are in a vortex of change, you will be moving to a far better place. Change can be wonderful and necessary for growth. Although it can be hard getting through it at the time, in hindsight you will see the universe was working to your benefit.</p>
<p>You are the hero of this story, so as you walk the tightrope, don’t look down at the ravine below. Don’t glance from side to side. Just keep your gaze straight ahead, putting one foot in front of the other. You’ve got this—you are heading to a far better place, and the chaotic changes you’ve already been through have only rushed you forward faster to your place of safety and reward.</p>
