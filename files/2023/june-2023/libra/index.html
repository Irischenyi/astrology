        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>Your outlook for increasing your income is superb. Last month you had a large emphasis on your career in your chart, and you may have started inquiries. On June 2, at the beginning of the month, Venus will receive sparkling beams from Neptune, the latter based in your assignment house. This indicates VIPs are impressed with you, especially with your creative way of thinking. If you have a meeting scheduled on June 2, it will go well.</p>
<p>Although the eclipse last month on May 5 may have brought more financial concerns, soon after, on May 16, Jupiter entered your eighth house of other people’s money to stay for a year, until May 25, 2024. From now on, you are set to be quite a money magnet, and your financial picture will change, possibly quite dramatically.</p>
<p>If you work on commission, royalties, or licensing fees, your income will be especially high. You may do well with a court or divorce settlement, inheritance, or cash (or valuable) gift from family, or you may be surprised to find out that you have a large tax refund due. You might want to buy a small book of charity raffle tickets—you could win. (Lotto tickets are too hard to win.) You do have superb financial aspects, and that has to be heartening to hear!</p>
<p>You have other wonderful aspects this month. Fun, exciting travel is written all over your horoscope, so it looks like you will be pulling your suitcase out from under the bed and using it quite a bit. In fact, you will see this is true almost the moment the month begins.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>The full moon in Sagittarius set to appear on June 3 will bring a special opportunity to take a short trip, and it appears it will be plenty of fun. Mars, currently in compatible Leo, will send a brilliant beam to this full moon in Sagittarius at 13 degrees and to the moon’s partner, the Sun in Gemini. Mars is in your friendship house, so you may receive an invitation to stay with a dear friend in his or her country home. Saturn will be in hard, square angle to the Sun and full moon, however, so you may have special work to finish at the office before you can head out. Work quickly, dear Libra—you will love this trip.</p>
<p>Also at this full moon, you might be asked to sign a contract because the full moon is falling in your third house, which rules agreements (in addition to travel). Mercury is no longer retrograde, so after you show the document to your lawyer for his or her approval, you can sign it. If you have a writing or speaking project, it will likely wrap up within five days of June 3.</p>
<p>The June 3 full moon will especially favor those Libras who have a birthday that falls on October 6, plus or minus five days. It will also benefit you if you have a planet at 13 degrees (plus or minus five degrees) in Gemini, Libra, Aquarius, Aries, Leo, or Sagittarius, for this planet will work hard for you and add to the experience of the full moon on June 3.</p>
<blockquote><p>You are set to be quite a money magnet, and your financial picture will change, possibly quite dramatically.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>More travel opportunities may come up two weeks later on June 17 when the new moon will arrive in Gemini, 27 degrees. This time, you are likely to go a further distance than you did earlier in the month. This new moon will occur in your ninth house, which rules not only distant travel but also opportunities in international relationships, import-export, immigration (residency, citizenship, passports, and visas), publishing, broadcasting and digital media, higher education (college or graduate school), and legal matters.</p>
<p>There is one problem with this new moon, and that has to do with Neptune in hard angle to the Sun and new moon from his perch in your work-a-day assignment sector. Neptune can cloud information and cause some confusion, so if you are working in the realm of the media, such as speaking, writing, editing, or coding, be sure you are clear about what needs to be done.</p>
<p>A few days after the new moon we’ve just discussed, something very special is happening.</p>
<p>On June 19 you will see a five-star aspect when the planet called the giver of gifts and luck—Jupiter—will be in a strong, supportive angle to Saturn, the planet of structure and long-term gain. Jupiter is currently in your financial eighth house—ruling loans, mortgages, commissions, royalties, bonuses, advances, prize money, and gifts—and will be in lovely attitude to Saturn in your sixth house of work projects. These two planets will not meet again for several more years (and only once this year, on June 19). You will be given a rare and special chance to build the sturdy foundation of financial security you’ve long dreamed of having. This aspect is slow moving and will be in play all month.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>Achieve as much as you can this month because you are being helped by several planets. Just as importantly, note that Venus will go retrograde next month on July 22 until September 3 (which, in the US, is the day before Labor Day). Venus rules Libra, so you will find your goals will be temporarily placed on hold during those six weeks. It will be harder to make progress, so you will have to be patient. That’s why I feel you would be wise to get things done in June rather than putting anything off until July or August. Once you get to September 3, the end date of Venus retrograde, you will run into Mercury retrograde from August 23 to September 15.</p>
<p>Venus rules beauty and attractiveness but will shut down her best powers from July 22 to September 3, so avoid making important changes to your face. Venus retrograde is not the time to have a face-lift, Botox, or fillers, or veneers on your teeth. Do not ask your stylist to change the color or cut of your hair. Trims and regular grooming are, of course, OK. I am talking about radical changes to your looks and expensive changes, like Botox. A stylist or dermatologist might be in high demand, so set your appointments now. When you make your plans, leave a space of days before July 22 and after September 3.</p>
<p>Men, stay to the status quo, too—don’t grow a beard or shave one off. When you act while Venus is retrograde, you may not like the results or the response of those you love, for they may be resistant to the changes you make.</p>
<p>If you are single, Venus retrograde is not a favorable time to start a new romantic relationship. Your new alliance may be exciting at first, but in time, it will cool down so much that you may wonder what could have caused things to go so wrong. Or you may start to feel like you are dating a sibling, not a romantic partner. Venus rules warmth and affection, and Venus cannot give us the finest parts of her gifts when retrograde.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>If you are already attached, this trend will not affect your love life because you sealed your relationship some time ago, most likely when Venus was moving in strong, healthy orbit. (Venus retrogrades every 18 months for approximately 40 to 42 days—six weeks.)</p>
<p>Venus rules all things that embellish, so put off the purchase of a gemstone, for example, and hold off on buying that new, expensive perfume during the Venus retrograde. Venus also rules lavish parties and charity balls, so you’d get a far better outcome if you avoid giving your party or benefit during Venus retrograde. If you do host a lavish fund-raiser during Venus retrograde, the donations will likely be lackluster.</p>
<p>Venus is associated with money too, and for Libra, Venus controls your eighth house of other people’s money. This house rules credit cards, taxes, mortgages, bank loans, insurance payouts, government programs, and inheritances, and this is where your progress will seem to be temporarily stuck. Check all your statements for possible errors, and if you’re self-employed, your business will likely start to slow down in late July, but it will pick up again in the second half of September.</p>
<p>As said, this is a good month, and it has one spectacular aspect that I will describe now.</p>
<p>Mars, the alluring, action planet, is now in Leo and will remain in compatible Leo until July 10. Mars loves to be with his sweetheart Venus, and all this month Venus will be in strong, positive orbit. (Venus will not go retrograde until next month on July 22). When Venus and Mars are together, their job is to set off the sparks of attraction—that wonderful chemistry you sense when you have met someone special. Starting on June 5, Venus will enter Leo and edge very close to her sweetheart Mars in the night sky. I will be more specific.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>Although Venus and Mars will not make an exact conjunction this month (not until February 2024), they both will remain remarkably close, within four to five tiny degrees of each other from June 5 onward, encompassing all of June. This is remarkable. Venus and Mars will be in tight mathematical significance—close enough to whirl their magic wand for you.</p>
<p>Everyone of every sign will find ways to enjoy this closeness of Venus and Mars, but you are extra lucky because Venus is your ruler (weighted more heavily in your favor), and these two planets are also in the perfect part of your horoscope to make you happy—Leo, a fire sign that goes perfectly with your air-sign Libra element. Leo is your eleventh house, which includes happiness, joy, friendship, and social activity.</p>
<p>These lovebird planets are setting the stage for a light, breezy, and fun time for romance this month. If you are single, circle June as the month you will make an effort to meet a new romantic interest. Your house of friendship is lit up, so a friend might want to introduce you to someone. You may want to spend your weekends (or longer) this month at popular destinations for single people.</p>
<p>If you’re attached, enjoy your partner, and plan a trip or event you can look forward to together.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Last month you were dealing with a somewhat stressful financial situation that might have come up on or near May 5, the full moon lunar eclipse in Scorpio. You appear to still be working on the details of the news that eclipse brought up and deciding on an action to take. Although you may have been rattled by news, Jupiter, the great benefic planet, moved into your eighth house of finance a few days later for the first time in 12 years, so you will now have a large element of financial luck.</p>
<p>There is something you will have to do first before you get to feel the cornucopia of financial luck flowing to you. Pluto is still in a rare, hard angle to Jupiter, which is in your eighth house of money. This seems to suggest you will need to address a long-standing bill, possibly involving taxes or a student loan that must be paid soon. You are tired of financial stress and are changing the way you handle joint finances, credit cards, mortgages, or other types of other people’s money. This matter may also have to do with an impending expenditure you had hoped to make this month on behalf of a child or your need to invest more money in a creative project. In your career, you are loved and admired, and your time for advancement is coming, especially if you underscore your creative, out-of-the-box thinking.</p>
<p>Your chart also shows lots of possibilities for travel this month, and considering the pressure you’ve been under, you may jump at the opportunity to enjoy a little time away. The first opportunity will come at the full moon when you could take a short respite near June 3. A longer, more expansive trip may take place on (or after) the June 17 new moon, and it will bring you welcome relief. Staying out of town for as long as two weeks may be too hard to manage, for you have work projects coming down the assembly line that will rapidly need your attention.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>Whether you’re home or away, love seems to bloom brightly. Venus and Mars are orbiting unusually close—a wonderful indication of happiness and chances to enjoy romance. You have a certain brand of magnetic charm that simply won’t quit. You will be popular, and you will receive invitations, but you need to be smart about the ones you accept and those you don’t.</p>
<p>Last month’s eclipse will urge you to be careful with how freely you spend money as you move forward socially. Neptune is in a hard position at the new moon on June 17, so you may not know the full story—keep an eye on your credit card app to see how your balances look so that you won’t be shocked later when your statement arrives.</p>
<p>It looks like a new day is dawning, dear Libra, especially when it comes to money. Note on your calendar that Jupiter and Saturn have formed a collaboration to peak on June 19, but it will color the entire month. This aspect can give you the financial security you have worked toward for so long—decisions you make this month can go a long way (thanks to Saturn) to building the financial foundation for your life that you’ve always dreamed you would enjoy.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>Next month, the full moon in Capricorn may bring a move to a new address or some other action going on at home or in connection to your family. It’s an outstanding full moon, due July 3. You have so much to look forward to.</p>
<p>Although this month puts a strong emphasis on money, it also shows that you’re taking steps to find an ideal work-life balance. You’ve made it a priority, and that’s why you can find the perfect mix.</p>
<p>Venus, your ruler, will be flying hand-in-hand with her lover Mars in one of the sweetest, most affectionate parts of your chart, the fun-loving sign of Leo. You have a shot at enjoying genuine, lasting love as you enter this month—make plans!</p>
