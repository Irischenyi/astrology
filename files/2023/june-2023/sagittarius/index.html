        <p>April and May each brought an eclipse and changes along with them, but you are a highly flexible, mutable sign, so you generally deal well with the need to adapt to rapidly shifting conditions. June will be an easier month than May, and July will be even smoother.</p>
<p>This month opens with an important full moon in Sagittarius, 13 degrees, on June 3. Something of enormous importance to you, possibly involving a relationship, will come to a culmination within five days of this date. You will get a clear picture of what will make you truly happy, and in the process, you may reprioritize your list of goals. A key relationship may be an important focus at this full moon, too.</p>
<p>Mars, the action planet, currently in fellow fire-sign Leo, will be beautifully oriented to this full moon, adding vibrancy and energy. Mars is currently in your travel house, so this full moon could set off an important long-distance trip, possibly overseas, for work or pleasure.</p>
<p>Saturn will be in hard angle to the June 3 full moon, however, reminding you that you have obligations at home to a family member, such as a parent or one of your children (as two possibilities), or it may be that a situation involving your physical home needs attention. If you need to fly to a distant city for professional reasons (very possible) and you cannot delay the trip, you will need to designate a trusted, responsible person to keep things humming at home while you are away. Something happening there seems like it will press on you.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>Mars recently started to move through your travel sector (ninth house) on May 20 and will remain until July 10, so this really is a perfect time to pack and go, if you can organize things at home just so. Here is what makes this particular tour of Mars so special.</p>
<p>I need to explain that Mars adores Venus, his cosmic lover, but due to their very different orbits, they are rarely together. The best they can do is gaze at one another through binoculars across the deep space sprinkled with thousands of twinkling stars. That changes in June.</p>
<p>On June 5 Venus will enter Leo, the same part of the sky as Mars. While Venus and Mars will not make a conjunction this month (that full embrace won’t happen until February 22, 2024), they will be remarkably close—within four to five tiny degrees of separation, which is mathematically significant. This all means that your travels would not only be successful but also very happy. If you can manage to take care of your home and those who depend on you, this month would be an ideal time for a vacation or business trip. Early July, until July 10, would be great, too.</p>

        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>I should let you know now that although Venus only rarely retrogrades, Venus will go retrograde next month from July 22 to September 3, a period of six weeks. (In the US, September 3 is the day before Labor Day.) To complicate things a little more, Mercury will also retrograde during part of the time Venus is retrograde, from August 23 to September 15. We don’t generally feel the retrograde action of outer planets sharply, but we do feel the planets that orbit closest to earth when they’re out of phase, namely Mercury, Mars, and Venus. Mars will stay in healthy direct speed, but both Venus and Mercury will overlap in retrograde.</p>
<p>Now let’s focus on Venus, for she is first to retrograde next month, and it would be wise to prepare for this period. Venus rules love, beauty, fun, luxury, and also profits. Venus retrograde would not be the right time to schedule plastic surgery, Botox, fillers, cosmetic dentistry, or a dramatic change to your hair cut or color. These are often expensive beauty procedures, and you might not like the results if you schedule them while Venus is napping. (Trims and touch-ups are OK as there is no need to look like a little ragamuffin.) If you have appointments set, change them right away to be sure none of yours fall between July 22 and September 3. Men: Don’t grow a beard or shave one off. When it comes to improving your looks during Venus retrograde, stick to the status quo.</p>
<p>In matters of love, if you are attached, you will not be affected by Venus retrograde. If you are single and hoping to find the love of your life, Venus retrograde would not be the time to date new people. You may be attracted to someone and feel like everything is great at the start, and then see the relationship cool down to the point that you’re just friends (or even find yourself ghosted by the other person.) It is best not to make the birth of the relationship have Venus retrograde embedded in it.</p>
<p>Put off buying precious gems (Venus rules all things that embellish or beautify). If you are giving a charity benefit, try to move it to the second half of September. (June would be fine to host your fund-raiser if you have already scheduled it, but don’t edge too close to the start date of Venus retrograde on July 22.) Put off a lavish party until a time when Venus is strong. During Venus retrograde, donations would be lower than expected because Venus is associated with money, too. If you have a product or service aimed at women, delay it—Venus is associated with women.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>As you see, it’s best to get things done this month.</p>
<p>On June 17, the new moon in Gemini, 27 degrees, will give you the impetus to combine forces with a person who is special and important to you. You may get engaged or wed, or professionally, you may sign with a new business partner, accountant, lawyer, consultant, real estate broker, or even a wedding planner or other expert you will work with confidentially on a one-to-one basis.</p>
<p>The problem with the June 17 new moon is that Neptune will be in a hard, 90-degree square to this new moon. This means that if you are getting engaged, for example, you may be carried away with the vision of love, but you’ll need to be a little more realistic about your expectations. Neptune is known to cover reality with a gossamer veil that makes everything look soft, sparkling, and as beautiful as a fairy tale. In matters of business, you may become so enthusiastic about a project that you might not perform the due diligence you know you need to do. Think about your assumptions—sometimes when we don’t know everything about a person or project, we become so enthusiastic that we fill in the blanks with what we feel are logical assumptions. Those might not be so logical with Neptune having a strong presence in the weeks following the new moon in Gemini on June 17.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to a spectacular aspect that is due on June 19—it will color all of June and the first part of July. At this time your ruler Jupiter in Taurus will be in perfect alignment with Saturn in Pisces. This aspect will not be repeated this year—this is the only time—and it will not come again for several more years. The rarer an aspect is, the more you feel it because you have not had a great deal of experience with it. Taskmaster Saturn is in your house of home, and as I mentioned earlier, Saturn is giving you responsibility for the care and well-being of a family member or for your physical home itself. For example, you may be saving or actually buying your first home and learning about the entire process, or you might have expenses associated with your home that are weighing on you.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>Here is the great news about Jupiter’s collaboration with Saturn—the decisions you make this month can have very long-range ramifications by helping you build a foundation of financial stability and an increased sense of security. Everyone of every sign will love this aspect, but because Jupiter is Sagittarius’ ruler, it is weighted more heavily in your favor. Saturn is in your home area (fourth house), and that is where Jupiter will pour his liquid golden light of benefits. Jupiter is currently in your work-a-day project sector (sixth house), so you will be very busy, your business will be brisk, and the new clients you bring in will likely stay with you for a long time.</p>
<p>Jupiter is also strongly associated with travel, so if you are getting married and you know each other well, your honeymoon to an exotic location overseas should be quite divine.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Ever since the solar eclipse appeared in Aries on April 19 and the lunar eclipse on May 5 in Scorpio (eclipses always come in pairs), life has felt like a carnival ride—sometimes thrilling, sometimes frightful, but never boring. You are a mutable sign, which means you are flexible, versatile, and adaptable, so you came out better than most under these eclipses.</p>
<p>Amid the changes around you, you now have a full moon in Sagittarius on June 3 that will help you center yourself and decide what is most important to you. Once you know your deeply felt priorities, the pieces of your plan will fall into place. This full moon may take you off on a trip, and it could also have you focused on a relationship. Saturn, however, is pressing you to help a family member or address a situation regarding your residence.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>Elsewhere in your horoscope, planets in fixed signs are pulling energies in various, opposite directions and not showing any mood for cooperation. Fixed signs are hardwired to maintain their positions. Since many planets are in fixed signs now—Mars and Venus in Leo, Uranus, Mercury, and Jupiter all in Taurus, Pluto in Aquarius (until June 11), plus a recent lunar eclipse on May 5 in Scorpio—it means no one around you is willing to yield an inch. You seem to be facing a deadlock. Sometimes this happens. Don’t try to force or rush matters because that will not work. Be patient—all planets move continuously and will pass through their stubborn positions.</p>
<p>It would be best to wait for the new moon on June 17 and the days that follow to resume talks with a potential new partner. New moons usually change up the energy and herald new chapters. This new moon will not exactly bring a miracle, however, for it has a problem of its own attached to it—namely a difficult Neptune bent on clouding facts. Yet this new moon is in Gemini, your opposite sign, so it therefore refers to the person with whom you are ready to create an agreement. Gemini is a versatile, mutable sign just like yours.</p>
<p>All month (and reaching an apex on June 19) Saturn, the long-term, stabilizing planet, will send a rare, quite special, and friendly boost to benefic Jupiter, your ruler. (Whenever your ruler is involved, the aspect is given more weight and importance to you.) This tells me you can come to an excellent final resolution, but it will take some work to get there. There seems to be various, unrelated, unconnected, and disparate elements pulling at you simultaneously, making this situation hard, but not impossible, to untangle. Saturn and Jupiter are looking over you—the decisions you come to now have the ability to create long-term stability and financial security. You will have to perform your due diligence—research your new relationships and ventures thoroughly and have realistic expectations. If you feel solid about all you discover, move forward.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>At the same time a friendship or romantic relationship (or one involving a child) could be on your mind, along with a need or desire to change or improve your physical home. You may be meditating about where to live or in what style. Or you might be quite concerned about the care and well-being of a family member—a question you might come back to several times this month.</p>
<p>Thankfully, your work assignments will pour in abundantly, and they will pay well. Your responsibilities to these projects seem to be coming to a resolution on other fronts.</p>
<p>Mercury will be the one key to getting the best from this new moon, emphasizing a partnership on June 17. The excellent news is that Mercury will be in a fine position to help. Mercury will send happy vibrations to Mars and Venus—both will be orbiting together in fire-sign Leo, your ninth house of international travel and ventures (which, in itself, is quite positive for Sagittarius). A foreign person who either lives in your country or abroad could bring you ideas, positive news, or wise advice. If you are working with a lawyer, your well-aspected ninth house rules legal action, so your attorney could have encouraging guidance for you as well.</p>
<p>In all, I feel you can make a lot of progress this month, and I find you will like the direction you are heading.</p>
