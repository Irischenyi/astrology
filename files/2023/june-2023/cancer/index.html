        <p>The past few months have been difficult due to planets in fixed signs that seem bent on sticking to their positions and not willing to compromise. This month is a little better, but June opens with Mars in Leo still opposed to Pluto in Aquarius, and both will be in harsh angle to Jupiter in Taurus. This is a tense aspect where both sides vie for control or to be proven right.</p>
<p>This conflict between Pluto and Mars at the start of June is likely to make you temporarily concerned about cash flow, perhaps due to higher than usual expenses that you’ve recently experienced, which can be blamed on Mars in Leo, but they’ll dissipate when Mars moves on to Virgo on July 10.</p>
<p>A full moon comes quickly at the start of the month, too, on June 3, and falling in Sagittarius, 13 degrees, your work-a-day sector (sixth house), suggests a project is coming to an end and is ready to show to management or the client. Alternatively, it may be that you will see a trusted worker announce a departure. I would normally say this would be coming at a bad time, but there is never a good time to see a valuable employee leave. It means you will need to take time to interview others and then train the new person, an exhausting process. Of course, it is possible that an employee has not been working out, and it would be your decision to ask the person to leave. (It is never easy for a Cancer to fire anyone, so if this is how things work out, you could feel some stress.)</p>
<p>Saturn will be in hard angle to the full moon and Sun of June 3, so you will feel the weight of responsibility you have taken on your shoulders at work, and Saturn will remind you that you’ll need to be practical and clear-eyed. You may be feeling a little tired and worn to the bone—see if you can treat yourself to extra sleep.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>The saving grace is that Mars (ruler of your prestigious tenth house of career reputation) will be in a great angle to the full moon, so management or your client is likely to feel you did a wonderful job—no worries about that! Also, there is the prospect at this full moon, June 3, of more money as a result of the work you did. That should help the cash flow situation you might be feeling.</p>
<p>As you see, this full moon is mixed, with many different messages, but in the end, things should work out to your favor. I feel this way because the full moon will be in Sagittarius, putting Jupiter, which will be in fine angle to Saturn, in the lead, and this is a rare and sound aspect suggesting decisions you make at this time could have a long-term, stabilizing effect on your finances. Saturn and Jupiter are slow-moving planets and will be within mathematical significance of each other on the full moon of June 3. They will reach peak, perfect aspect on June 19—this is the only time these two planets will meet this year—and this is a gorgeous aspect.</p>
<p>Keep that date of June 19 in mind if you need to commit to anything important, for it sparkles brightly, but again, I am splitting hairs—Jupiter and Saturn will be close enough for you to benefit from their proximity all month.</p>
<blockquote><p>You have plenty to celebrate now with good-fortune Jupiter in Taurus. Suddenly people in your company and industry are paying attention to you. Enjoy the fanfare, dear Cancer.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>I say you will do well in June, fully aware that concurrently, Jupiter in Taurus will be in conflict with Pluto in Aquarius early in June, but that simply means you will need to tweak your budget, put a dent in credit card balances as quickly as possible, and re-examine spending and investing in the light of current conditions. Cancer is one of the four signs said to be especially talented with financial management (Taurus, Scorpio, and Capricorn are the other three), so I have no doubt you will emerge stronger and on firmer ground after this full moon.</p>
<p>The new moon arrives two weeks later on June 17, and, like everything else this month, brings messages both positive and not so positive, mainly in terms of delays or unclear communication. It is falling so late in Gemini (27 degrees) that Cancers with birthdays on June 21, June 22, or June 23 may feel the effects of this new moon strongly. If your birthday has been named, there will be a matter of enormous personal importance that you will initiate because this new moon will be making an out-of-sign conjunction to your birthday.</p>
<p>This June 17 new moon will have a mild but positive effect for you, as it will light your twelfth house of creative or intellectual work you would do in solitude. If you need to do research or are working on a writing project, such as a novel, column, screenplay, thesis, white paper, or other important document, the Sun and new moon, both in the communicative sign of Gemini, will help you create a stunningly good work.</p>
<p>This new moon suggests quiet contemplation, and if you are creative, expression and experimentation would bring positive results. This is also the area ruling the subconscious mind, so if you feel you would like to speak to a therapist about something that has troubled you, or feel it is time to enter a rehab center, this new moon on June 17 would be your very best time to do so.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>As you see, this can only be called a strange month, straight out of a Federico Fellini movie—a bit surreal and as distorted as a strange dream. Still, if you look closer, things will always be anchored in reality.</p>
<p>Earlier I mentioned expenses that have had you feeling tense but that they would calm down after Mars leaves Leo on July 10. There is one mitigating factor in June that I am excited to tell you about, for it could, if you try, help increase your income.</p>
<p>Mars is orbiting within four tiny degrees of his lover Venus all month. As of June 5, both planets will be in the same constellation of Leo, which is your financial sector. Venus is associated with money and luxury, and both she and her sweetheart in Leo will be in a stronger position to help you. You do have a magnetic quality and can attract moneymaking opportunities, but it will be up to you to look for them.</p>
<p>I should tell you that next month, Venus will go retrograde in Leo from July 22 to September 3 (in the US that’s the day before Labor Day). This is rare for Venus—she goes retrograde only every 18 months for approximately six weeks—so you are not used to seeing Venus out of phase. It is never wise to schedule changes in your appearance during a Venus retrograde period, for Venus rules beauty and good looks and, therefore, is associated with your face.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>It would not be the time to have a face lift, Botox, fillers, cosmetic dentistry, or a complete change in your hair style or color. Schedule those appointments now or in the first 10 days of July, no later, or wait until after the new moon in Virgo, September 14. Venus rules all things that embellish life too, so it’s not a good time, from July 22 to September 3, to buy precious jewels, for example.</p>
<p>Most astrologers feel if you are single, Venus retrograde would not be a good time to start a new relationship because Venus rules love and affection, and during her retrograde, she strongly caps her benefits to you. You may start a relationship in June, but keep it on a slow simmer. If you meet when Venus is retrograde, you may find the relationship seems initially exciting, but the relationship’s warmth of might not last. If you build Venus retrograde into the birth of the relationship, love will cool off too quickly, leaving you feeling like the two of you are just friends or siblings, not lovers. If you are already attached, you won’t likely be affected because you started your relationship long before.</p>
<p>Venus rules parties, spas, and charity balls, so you would do best to have those now, in June or during the first two weeks of July, or else delay having your party until after September 3. Always leave a space of days at the start and end dates of a planet’s retrograde. When it comes to a charity ball, with Venus’ association with money, donations are likely to be lower than anticipated, and payments might be delayed. It is not the time to ask for a raise, either—do that now in June.</p>
<p>I know it is disappointing to hear that Venus will retrograde. Still, you have plenty to celebrate now with good-fortune Jupiter in Taurus. Until last month, May 16, Jupiter was in Aries, helping you to establish yourself as a winner in your career. Suddenly people in your company and industry paid attention to you, and some wanted to know the recipe to your secret sauce for success. How did you manage to do so well? There are no rules that say you have to share your secret—that hard work and genuine care for others is at the core of your effectiveness. People who don’t have your qualities would never understand anyway—enjoy the fanfare, dear Cancer.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>Now with Jupiter in Taurus until May 25, 2024, a year from now, you will have many more opportunities to have fun. Love, long-distance travel, relaxation, and time with your children all will rate high on your list. We have to first get through Venus retrograde from July 22 to September 3, so at that time stick to the status quo. Keep in mind that your chart sparkles for personal fun and reward from September through most of May 2024. Great reward and personal, emotional satisfaction will all come to you this year and next. No one deserves it more than you.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>The planets are in a weird mood. There are three orbiting in fixed signs, forming what’s known as a T-square, with Mars opposing Pluto, both filling financial houses, and both in square to Jupiter, so money is on your mind, and it seems like a hard question to figure out. You have been doing outstandingly well at work, impressing management and clients, so you appear to have every reason to make a good salary. Yet your expenses are clearly running high. You seem frustrated that you may have to put aside a purchase or expenditure you had set your heart on. If this is true for you, keep your chin up and remind yourself that “not now” does not mean “not ever.” I see this as a temporary situation.</p>
<p>With planets, including good-fortune Jupiter, moving into your eleventh house of joy and happiness, finances will turn to your favor in July. Additionally, Mars is due to move into a better position on July 10, allowing you to get a good grip on financial matters. For now, be patient and temporarily put off spending for high-ticket items. Life will return to normal, and I promise that you will feel less tense.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>The full moon of June 3 will bring a work project to conclusion, or it may be that you will come to a decision about a person who reports to you—whether to keep that person on staff or not. Letting someone go is never easy for compassionate Cancer. Saturn will be in hard angle to the Sun, so whatever is cresting at work seems to be taking a toll on you. Yet on the other hand, you can’t have people reporting to you that are not doing their job, so you may have to bite the bullet.</p>
<p>Last month Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, moved into Taurus and will stay a full 12 months, until next year, May 25, 2024. Your friends will become a marvelous source of happiness, and you are likely to bond closer to them. New people will enter your life too, and one or two have the strong possibility of becoming a close friend. Also, among the faces that pour into your life, you may meet a romantic interest this month—someone you will want to stay in your life a long time. You tend to be a homebody, but in the coming months, make an effort to be out and about, for both personal pleasure and to circulate professionally to advance your career.</p>
<p>You are moving into a period where you will need to switch from working formally—by writing proposals and reports—to adopting a high-profile public persona and being seen by those you know, and those you don’t, in your industry. Your greatest growth will come through socializing.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>After the new moon June 17, if you are single and unattached, you may meet someone new that may intrigue you. Avoid getting involved quickly because Neptune will be active and spin a vortex of confusion. Neptune will present you with a veiled view of life—pretty but not realistic. The new person you may be interested in might still be committed to another but conceal this fact. As it’s been said, trust but verify.</p>
<p>Also at that new moon in Gemini on June 17, if you have not yet, find a way to unwind and withdraw from the daily fray of life so you can recharge with rest, for it will become necessary at this point. You may feel depleted by needing to be attentive to others’ needs and fulfilling expectations. Treat yourself to a small luxurious experience and pampering—perhaps at a spa—because it could give you a major boost. If you feel a need to talk over a problem, therapy taken after June 17 would be an excellent idea. At the very least, give yourself time to think, to pray or meditate, and to work in solitude on a project—possibly an artistic or literary one—where you can enjoy a peaceful pace. July will be quite special, so you have plenty to look forward to.</p>
