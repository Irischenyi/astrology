        <p>As June opens, you will be thinking a lot about money, concerned that you will need more soon to keep up with large expenses this month. Your chart, however, suggests that you have nothing to worry about. Last month, as of May 16, Jupiter, the great benefic planet that brings gifts and luck, entered your second house of earned income for the first time in 12 years and will remain here for a full year, until the May 25, 2024. You may be currently negotiating a raise or the salary of a new job. If you are self-employed, you may be pitching a lucrative new client.</p>
<p>You might find the negotiations initially hard because Pluto is pushing back on Jupiter. These two planets have been getting along, but just not now. This means you might not get the salary you are asking for but, rather, a bit less. In that case, if you feel the job interests you but the salary is disappointing, you might delicately ask about when you will be reviewed for a raise. If the answer is in six months, that’s good news, and if the answer is (let’s say) in three years, you might want to look at other options. If you are self-employed, make sure you have realistic expectations—with Pluto square Jupiter for a few months, you may have to be more conservative in your expectations.</p>
<p>Still, having said that, I feel you are in a period of enormous financial reward—this period is just beginning and is set to last 12 months. If you are new at negotiating for yourself, read up on how to approach a negotiation so that both sides come out feeling good about the results. (Getting to Yes by Roger Fisher is my favorite book on this subject.)</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>You have a slew of sparkly aspects, so stay positive. You have good-fortune Jupiter on your side and Venus, too. (Venus is also associated with wealth and additionally, beauty and luxury.) Besides Jupiter, Uranus (planet of surprises) and Mercury are all crowded into your solar second house of salary and possessions. Just as significantly, last month on May 19, you had a new moon in Taurus, 28 degrees, and that new moon lit this same second house of salary, ready to trigger news. You may have had some budding financial opportunities or discussions since that new moon arrived, and the energy of that new moon will continue to carry discussions forward into June.</p>
<p>There is another reason I am so optimistic about your ability to see an increase in earned income. Saturn will be in the ideal position all through June to bolster Jupiter’s effort to bring you reward for all the hard work you’ve done over the past few years. Even though you may encounter a Doubting Thomas (in the form of Pluto), keep looking for financial gain. If you stick to your program, Saturn will give you a solid sense of financial security, so, as you see, you have plenty of aces up your sleeve—be confident, and considering your performance and experience, ask for what you feel is fair compensation.</p>
<p>Let’s look at Mars for a moment, because Mars is Aries’ ruler, so his position matters quite a bit when looking at your outlook for June.</p>
<blockquote><p>Jupiter, the good-fortune planet, will contact Saturn in a friendly way on June 19. This could turn out to be a five-star day that will come laden with opportunity.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>Mars had been in Cancer and put a strong spotlight on your family and home. Then on May 20 last month that changed, and Mars went into an even better sign for you—fellow fire-sign Leo—and this move will spell much more fun for you during Mars’ stay in Leo until July 10. You will also now have a chance to develop your creativity in an impressive manner, so if this thought is one you find exciting, spend time on your craft this month.</p>
<p>By midmonth, something enchanting will happen—Mars will be within range of his sweetheart Venus. These two planets always long to be together but rarely are, as the universe gives Venus and Mars different assignments that send them into varying far-flung regions of the universe. Lucky you, Venus and Mars will be just a few degrees apart in your fifth house of true love and happiness throughout the month, and will be as close as three tiny degrees from each other on June 27.</p>
<p>If you are ready to meet someone new, ask friends to make introductions for you—the days from June 17 through the end of the month will be special for love. June 17 will help you on another level too—it will mark the date of the new moon in compatible Gemini, an air sign that makes your fire element of Aries burn more brightly.</p>
<p>I need to tell you that next month, Venus will go retrograde on July 22 until September 3. (In the US, September 3 falls the day before Labor Day.) This does not happen very often—Venus goes retrograde only every 18 months for approximately six weeks.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>Venus retrograde requires some planning. It’s not a good time to make any startling important changes to your appearance. That means you should not schedule Botox, fillers, veneers, or a radically different haircut or color, or for men, to grow a beard or shave one off. Stick to the tried and true. If you make changes during Venus retrograde (July 22 and September 3), the chances are you won’t like the way things work out. It can be hard to get in to see popular dermatologists or stylists, so if you’d like to make any change to your appearance, make your appointments now (and don’t make the appointment too close to July 22 either. Leave a space of days.)</p>
<p>Venus retrograde, July 22 to September 3, will also not be a favorable a time to buy anything ruled by Venus—expensive jewels, for example. Venus rules fun and luxury, so then would not be the best time to give a lavish party or charity benefit, either. Life is usually more subdued when Venus is out of phase. Venus rules love, so if you are single, it is not, as a rule, a good time to start to date someone new—the relationship may become chilly after the first blush of love, and in time you may feel a distinct lack of warmth and affection.</p>
<p>The month we are in now, June, is a positive, solid month, so for the time being, focus on all you can do to enjoy it.</p>
<p>Travel will be a strong emerging theme. You may ache for a change of scene, and at the full moon June 3 in Sagittarius, 13 degrees, you may take a trip. Between June 1 and June 8, a trip would do you a world of good. Once at your destination, you may want to explore the vicinity and engage in your favorite sports. Your ruler Mars will be in ideal position to support the full moon of June 3. You will be feeling adventurous, playful, and jovial, so if you get a chance, by all means go.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>Other areas of gain for you on or near June 3 include international relationships and foreign people and places: matters of immigration, residency, passports, and visas. You will also find opportunity with the media in publishing, broadcasting, or digital forms as you may get an offer for a part-time or permanent job as editor, columnist, researcher, fact checker, or producer or any other role in TV, radio, podcasting, or publishing. Additionally, efforts you make toward either a college or graduate degree will show impressive progress after the full moon NEXT month appears July 3, plus five days.</p>
<p>More travel may come up as a result of the new moon this month on June 17 in Gemini. This trip, if you take one, will likely take you to a setting that’s much closer to home. Still, it could be fun, too.</p>
<p>You may get important papers to look over, and provided your lawyer says the document is ready for your signature, you can proceed, for Venus and your ruler Mars will be highly supportive. Saturn, however, will be in hard angle to Mercury, suggesting you may have to perform a lot to satisfy the agreement—make sure you understand all you will have to do. The one part I worry about is that Neptune will be in hard angle to the new moon June 17, clouding the opportunity or the responsibilities you would take on, so again, you need to ask many questions.</p>
<p>Next month after Mars leaves Leo on July 10, your work life will jump into high gear, and you won’t have as much time to travel. Before you get to July 10, though, Mars in Leo will encourage you relax, see friends, enjoy romance, play and delight with children, and do sports, so now is when you should take time and step off the merry-go-round of life to nurture your personal, emotional life.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>There is more evidence that July will become a powerful time for your career. Next month’s full moon on July 3 will be your most important career full moon of the year—this one will light your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement. If you have been discussing a job, one of your very best offers will come through at this time. If you are self-employed, you may hear thrilling news that you have landed a very prestigious client.</p>
<p>As you see, if you can travel in June, take the opportunity because it will get very busy professionally in July. This is all good news!</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>June has plenty to offer, but it’s a month that will require some careful sidestepping of obstacles. You will also need to be sure not to be lured into a conflict when someone tries to provoke you. In this case we can blame Pluto.</p>
<p>The full moon will appear on Saturday June 3 in Sagittarius, your travel sector, making it a perfect time to enjoy the season and plan a getaway. Your mind is craving new things to see, new people to meet, and fresh colors, sights, and sounds to take in. Saturn will be in hard angle to the Sun and full moon, so you may have obligations to meet before you can go, but if you are organized, you can take care of those in advance.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>At the same time, Mars, your ruler, will be sublimely supportive as he continues his tour of Leo, brightening your possibilities to enjoy true love, children, and leisure, as well as allowing time for pampering. With Mercury conjunct Uranus at the very same time as the full moon, you may spontaneously want to go shopping—it sounds like fun, so clear your desk so you can enjoy yourself at this time.</p>
<p>The new moon in Gemini on June 17 will also set off a yen in you to travel, this time a little closer to home, yet still give you an equal amount of pleasure.</p>
<p>If you are discussing a new deal, especially in mid-June, Neptune will be active, so you may misread a situation and assume it represents a better opportunity than it is. This is a new moon, so you could be starting a new chapter—be sure to ask plenty of questions because details will count. You don’t want to build a future on a venture that seems good but has risky elements you will not be aware of at the onset.</p>
<p>Several days later Jupiter, the good-fortune planet, will contact Saturn in a friendly way on June 19. This could turn out to be a five-star day that will come laden with opportunity. A confidential meeting with your financial advisor or accountant could lead to long-term results that will lead you to a richer and more secure future. Considering that the new moon June 17 will be in hard angle to Neptune, be practical and realistic—avoid excessive risks. Seeds that you planted several years ago near December 2020 will now start to grow and show profits. It will be gratifying to see your hard work pay off.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>Jupiter, the good fortune planet, moved into Taurus last month on May 16, so this generous planet is currently in your second house of earned income. You have moved into a period of great financial reward. By the time Jupiter exits this area of your chart next year on May 25, 2024, you could increase your net worth and enjoy a feeling of great financial security. If you play your cards right, you can lower debt and invest your surplus wisely.</p>
<p>Your career is likely to enjoy an uptick in income, and you also have Pluto about to move back into Capricorn, your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement, on June 11, to stay in your prestigious professional sector until January 20, 2024.</p>
<p>Once you get to January 20, 2024, Pluto will move into Aquarius, never again to be in your professional house during your lifetime. (Pluto takes 248 years to make a complete revolution around the Sun, so it will take that long to return to your career sector.) Accordingly, starting on June 11, you will get another shot to make a name for yourself in your industry between June 11, 2023, and January 20, 2024, for Pluto will help you become more powerful and influential, so plan to work hard and smart in that period.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>Your best time for love will be after June 17, a Saturday, when Venus and Mars will be close to each other. These two planets are called the cosmic lovers, and they will be gazing into each other’s eyes in Leo, your solar fifth house of true love, throughout the second half of June, never being more than a few degrees apart. Wow.</p>
<p>Ask friends to make an introduction for that date, June 17—and through all of June—if you are single, and if you are attached, plan something special for the two of you to celebrate the love you have found with your one-and-only. This time will be very special. Make plans!</p>
