        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>Last month, in May, you had a gaggle of planets crowded into your prestigious tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement, so most Leos had exciting news to share—a new business or a major promotion, an honor or award, or enviable publicity. Your star is on the rise, and you are just cranking up.</p>
<p>Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, is now in Taurus, a place Jupiter entered last month on May 16 and has not been for 12 years. Jupiter’s position is significant because he is positioned at the very pinnacle of your chart, shining like a beacon in this very same tenth house of major career advancement. This is not a house of everyday work projects—that’s a different part of the chart (sixth house)—this house is linked to your ultimate contribution to the world and your work over a lifetime that later adds up to your legacy. The coming months, all the way to May 25, 2024, will be the time to make your mark in your career.</p>
<p>While you will always get chances during your life to rise through the ranks to new professional heights, after Jupiter leaves at the end of May 2024, you won’t have it as easy to break through career barriers as you do now, not until Jupiter returns in April 2035 to May 2036. I am trying to convince you to use this precious energy and to work hard with a sense of purpose and aim for your career dream.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at June and all the social potential it holds for you. Mars will still be in Leo, a holdover from last month when Mars entered Leo on May 20. It is almost always a plus to have Mars in your sign—Mars will give you presence, courage, confidence, and charisma, as well as energy and drive. It’s the perfect time to go after dreams that are important to you. There is a little problem in that Pluto is giving you a hard time by standing in the doorway, preventing you free access, and vying for power. This is a temporary aspect, but you may feel someone pressuring you in early June. If you do, know that this aspect, although slow moving, will be out of range by June 6.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>In the meantime, you will encounter the full moon June 3 in Sagittarius, 13 degrees, which should be a romantic, happily emotional moon. You may meet someone new and have a divine experience together. The meeting seems to be a social, personal setting, so you might meet at a party, but not at work.</p>
<p>Over this weekend of June 3-4, you may be invited to a festive event, such as to a friend’s exquisite wedding or lavish birthday party. Your fifth house of true love will be lit up, so you may have a magical romantic episode. Mars in Leo will be beautifully supportive of this full moon, so you could feel that you are going through a dream experience. Saturn in Pisces will be in hard angle to the Sun in Gemini and full moon in Sagittarius, however, so you may be concerned about the cost of participating in an expensive event. You might have to travel far or buy an entirely new outfit to attend. It does sound memorable though, so see if you can make it happen. There’s more.</p>
<p>Benefic, generous Jupiter will be in ideal angle to responsible Saturn, suggesting that new friends you make may actually help you with your career, possibly by meeting someone at this event that will be a good contact and who you can work with in the future. Or you may hear of a tip that helps you go after business that will make you money—enough to cover the cost of this event and more, making your attendance to be quite fortunate for you.</p>
<blockquote><p>Having Venus AND Mars in your sign is outstanding and will likely make for a marvelously fun month with plenty of moon-lit moments to enjoy with the one you love.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>Leos with birthdays that fall on or within four days of August 4 will feel the influence of this full moon the most. You will also benefit if you have a natal planet in Aries, Leo, Sagittarius, Gemini, Libra, or Aquarius at 13 degrees (plus or minus five degrees).</p>
<p>More good news about fun and love is on the way. Mars and Venus are known as the cosmic lovers, for when together, their job in the universe is to start the spark of love. On June 5, Venus will enter Leo and orbit very close to Mars, within four to six degrees all month. They won’t make an exact conjunction, but they don’t need to. Because they will be so close, they will be within mathematical significance.</p>
<p>Venus and Mars will be perfectly capable of spreading joy all over your chart. You will be at your most charming and magnetic. Your outlook for fun and love this month is simply staggering. Venus always wants to be with Mars, but due to their different orbits, this is hard to accomplish. Usually all they can be is content to gaze at one another through binoculars across a star-studded sky. They will be so happy to be near each other from June 5 onward, making this a highly romantic, fun month for you. Imagine—Venus and Mars will be in Leo. It can’t get any better than this!</p>
<p>The theme of getting out to see friends and being with others, while you take a break from all the career planning and success you may have had recently, will continue with the new moon on June 17 in Gemini, 27 degrees. You may be attending a fun convention or seminar or having a series of dinners with different friends. If you belong to a club, you may be intrigued by the events they’re putting on this month. You are dying to get out of the house, and you should—you have a superb chance to make a new close friend, which is always a happy prospect. A new moon lasts for weeks and months, but it’s strongest in the 10 days after it appears.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>Neptune will be in hard angle to this new moon, so the theme of needing to be mindful of the money you are spending will come up. Neptune is currently positioned in your eighth house, a financial sector, and Neptune is known to fog situations, in this case financial ones. I am trying to help you avoid having sticker shock later when you receive your credit card bill, so see friends, but keep watching your credit card app to see how much you’ve spent.</p>
<p>Get as much done during this highly productive month as possible. While all planets retrograde, the planets that orbit closest to earth are the ones we pay close attention to, and those are Mercury, Venus, and Mars. Mercury and Mars will be fine—it is Venus in Leo we have to watch for 44 days, starting next month.</p>
<p>Venus is due to go retrograde in Leo next month on July 22. Venus rules good looks and beauty, parties and fund-raiser events, precious jewels, expensive special-occasion dinners out, spa treatments, financial matters, and profits, as well as anything you would do to improve your looks. When Venus retrogrades, she cannot send you her gifts.</p>
<p>Starting next month, July 22, and continuing until September 3, do not have a face-lift, Botox, or fillers while Venus is retrograde. Don’t give a big expensive party, launch a new product or service (profits will be lower if you do), or give a charity ball (donations will be lackluster during this time). It is not the time to make a radical change to the way you wear your hair or have it colored.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>Stick to the status quo until early September, leaving a space of a few days before and after Venus goes retrograde. Also, if you are single, do not start a new romantic relationship—you are likely to find the relationship, with Venus retrograde built into the start of the relationship, will cool off, and you’ll wonder what happened. Venus rules love and affection—ingredients a romantic relationship needs to flourish.</p>
<p>You have the very best aspect for any of these activities NOW in June. Get busy. Make all your Venus-oriented actions, like the ones I listed above, this month, in June, while things will continue to glow for you all month!</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You are a fixed sign, and as such, you are not usually enthusiastic about accepting radical change, but change has been coming, as you have seen over past months. You saw the handwriting on the wall in May, and possibly as early as late April.</p>
<p>This month the planets are still in a deadlock, many in fixed signs like yours, and none are cooperating. The toughest one, which reached a peak last month but is still in aspect, is Mars in Leo opposed to Pluto in Aquarius. This suggests someone in an adversarial position who may attempt a powerplay. If you experience a struggle with a certain individual in your circle, they appear not to be willing to compromise an inch. Mars in Leo is also working against Jupiter in Taurus, currently and newly based in your career house, suggesting you would have to spend for career-related costs that you had not anticipated. The need to keep an eye on rising costs is a persistent theme this month. As you begin June, you might still be working toward untangling a situation that landed in your lap in April or May through no fault of your own.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>At the same time, overall, your career is the best part of your chart. There are many professional opportunities bubbling up for you, but there appears to be one individual who will be working at cross-purposes to you—this person could be a competitor or someone who feels competitive with you, even though you may not feel the same way toward them. Or it may be that your romantic partner is feeling diminished by your rising professional success—in that case you may have to go out of your way to show your appreciation to him or her.</p>
<p>Still, it is a blessing that you have Mars in Leo, for that will make you more predominant in the situation and confident overall. Also, you have stunning aspects for career advancement now that Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, has entered your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement, joining Uranus, the planet of change and unexpected breakthroughs. Jupiter will signal Saturn this month, indicating you are making important, long-term decisions about your career and money that will work to give you financial security.</p>
<p>Mercury is also in this same prestigious professional advancement house with the other planets, making for a dazzling professional outlook. Last month you had a new moon as well as the transiting Sun (your ruler) in the prestigious professional area of your chart, so you may be having interviews or even be negotiating a new position.</p>
<p>Don’t underestimate the power of these rare aspects—you’ve not seen benefic Jupiter in this area of your chart in over a decade, and you will have until next year, the end of May 2024, to make your mark.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>The June 3 full moon in fellow fire-sign Sagittarius may be the most tender and romantic of the year for you. If you are single, you may meet someone new or have an enchanting event to attend together. You might travel to an exotic location that neither of you have ever visited and would enjoy experiencing together. The June 3 full moon (influential for five extra days) will help you weave a memory for you both.</p>
<p>On June 5, two days later, Venus will move into Leo for the rest of June, cuddling close to her lover Mars. Having Venus AND Mars in your sign is outstanding and will likely make for a marvelously fun month with plenty of moon-lit moments to enjoy with the one you love.</p>
<p>You will have a chance to see friends and relax after the new moon arrives on June 17. Venus and Mars will both be in Leo, and they will orbit quite close. Even though they will not make an exact conjunction, these planets will actually be close most of the month, orbiting within four to six degrees of one another. This will be a lovely influence, for Venus and Mars will amp up your charms, making them visible to one and all. You will be on everyone’s guest list, and you will have the privilege of picking and choosing among the most intriguing events to attend.</p>
<p>The new moon of June 17 will urge you to spend money, but keep track of the outgo. Like everything else this month, there are cross currents. You might unconsciously spend appreciably more than you anticipated and will have sticker shock when the bill arrives. If your credit card has an app, check it often, for that would be a good way to stay in control and have a soft landing later when it is time to pay. This will give new meaning to having your cake and eating it, too.</p>
