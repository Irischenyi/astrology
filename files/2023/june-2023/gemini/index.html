        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>It’s birthday month, and this one starts out with a full moon on June 3 in Sagittarius, 13 degrees. You will feel the energy of this full moon growing in strength the minute the month begins. Full moons bring to culmination all that has gone on before, so if your relationship is solid, the full moon could bring you to the next step—you may decide to move in together, propose, or get married at this full moon period (allow plus or minus five days from the date it appears). If the relationship you are thinking about is a business partnership or collaboration, you may be signing papers to make your new venture official. Mercury will be conjunct Uranus in Taurus, and because Mercury will take a leading role, there will be a surprise to what is going on. Let’s think positive thoughts and expect the best.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if this love or business relationship has not been going well for some time, it may bring contentious feelings to a new phase. If business, this partner may not want to continue talks about becoming part of the team, or if this person is already a colleague, he or she may announce a departure. In a romantic relationship, if you are wed or living together, the truth of the relationship will become clear, and if it’s troubled, you will reach a point of no return. It might be that you will decide things are simply not working, or it may be that your partner will say he or she has had enough.</p>
<p>Saturn will be in hard angle to this full moon, adding a sense of weight and responsibility to the situation. You may speculate who is at fault here—you or your partner. It is always helpful to think back and assess your relationship patterns, just don’t beat yourself up too much. If things end, you may also wonder how you will continue without this person’s help. If this is a romantic relationship, you may be concerned about the costs of going it alone without your partner’s financial assistance. If you’re in business together, you may be worried about how to find the right person to replace the one who is leaving and whether this candidate will require a higher salary.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>Be reassured that the changes you are making in your career will bring long-term gain, for Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, will be in fine angle to Saturn this month, a rare and special aspect that suggests the decisions you make now will benefit you. A full moon in Sagittarius will always give Jupiter the final card to play, and here we see that Jupiter is in a lovely, tight aspect to Saturn—a big plus!</p>
<p>Pluto and Jupiter will be at odds at this full moon, however, so you may have to tweak your financial plans or budgets in light of changing conditions. Pluto in Aquarius is in a tough spot with respect to Jupiter, but on June 11, Pluto will retrograde back into Capricorn for the remainder of this year and not return to Aquarius until January 20, 2024. Actually, Pluto in Aquarius is a better placement for you, but just not now—Jupiter in early degrees of Taurus is not currently friendly to Pluto in early degrees of Aquarius. By the time Pluto returns in January, the sky will have an entirely different picture to present because all the other planets will have moved into new positions. That’s a long way of saying that the tension you may be feeling over money is temporary—it will require some planning and adaptability, but as a mutable Gemini, you are great at finding an excellent Plan B or even a Plan C if Plan A doesn’t seem appropriate for now.</p>
<p>The full moon on June 3 seems to be bringing everything that’s happening to a climax. As I mentioned earlier, the outcome of this full moon will depend on how things have been going all along. Full moons are cleansing agents—they bring situations to the surface so that you can see the present-day situation more clearly.</p>

        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>I hope you will find this full moon to be happy, a moment that will draw you and a romantic or business partner together, and that you will not suffer the opposite possibility, a complete break or separation. Only you would know which outcome is more likely, by looking over past months to examine how the relationship has been going. I can say that Saturn’s position is urging you to be realistic, practical, and objective, which I know can sometimes be hard. If you are happy romantically, then it would be a beneficial time to come together, especially if you keep your expectations reasonable.</p>
<p>If your birthday falls on June 3, plus or minus five days, you will feel this full moon more directly than most members of your sign. If you have a natal planet in Gemini at 13 degrees (plus or minus five degrees), that planet will light up at this time.</p>
<p>A better moment of the month will come on June 17 at the only new moon this year in Gemini, 27 degrees. This new moon will be at its most powerful for 10 days, but in actuality, it will affect you for six months. Typically, you only have one new moon a year in Gemini, so this is significant. A new moon usually opens a door to a new opportunity, and this one has to do with something you dearly want. Your desire is so close to your heart that I cannot see precisely what it might be from where I sit, but you already know!</p>
<p>This new moon is flawed because Neptune will cast a veil of unreality over things, making it hard to decipher whether a situation is real and solid or more of a dream filled with happy assumptions that you hope will turn out to be true. It will be difficult to see whether the plan you are discussing has potential or not. The truth of this situation would not become evident until you have begun the venture and put effort into it (but by then it may be too late to pull out without expense and the loss of your time and energy). Be careful about what you enter at this time. Ask a lot of questions, and do a great deal of due diligence.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>Mercury, the planet that rules Gemini and also this new moon, will be in conflict with Saturn, so I hope you would not have to sign papers until next month. Sometimes you can’t quite maneuver the process so that it takes place at a better time, and you are forced to sign anyway or lose the opportunity. That’s why doing plenty of investigation will be important. If you are not sure, you might want to seek a second opinion from a trusted friend or colleague before committing to a new venture. If you already signed papers involving this endeavor weeks ago, then you will be in better shape for the action you are taking now.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to Mars which will actually be helpful to the new moon on June 17. Mars is currently in compatible Leo, your third house of communication—the very area you are known to be talented in. You may be involved in a writing or speaking assignment or project that should work out well.</p>
<p>Here is what is unusual about Mars’ position: Mars will be within four to five tiny degrees of a conjunction with Venus. Venus and Mars are called the cosmic lovers, and both are in the happy fire sign of Leo. Mars always wants to be near Venus, but due to their very different orbits, that rarely happens. Leo is compatible with your Gemini Sun, so any assignment you get should be enjoyable. Furthermore, Venus and Mars are in your solar third house, so you may receive an invitation to go on a quick, unanticipated, and spontaneous trip that turns out to be quite fun this month. (Venus and Mars will stay close all through June, but my favorite weekend for you to go will be June 17-18.)</p>
<p>I should tell you that Venus will retrograde next month from July 22 to September 3 (which in the US is the day before Labor Day). Venus rules love and affection, so plan to socialize this month, but after July 22, it would not be wise to begin a new relationship with Venus retrograde. Venus is all about warmth and affection, and in time, you might find these qualities to be lacking in any relationship started while Venus is retrograde.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>Also, do not make big changes to your looks while Venus is napping. It would be best to schedule a new hairstyle, hair coloring, veneers on your teeth, or Botox and fillers in June. You should not get too close to July 22, so leave a space of days. If you’re giving a lavish party or charity benefit, do so in June, early July, or September. Venus rarely retrogrades (thank goodness)—only every 18 months for about 43 days.</p>
<p>As you reach the end of the month, you will start to feel the growing full moon due on July 3 in Capricorn, 11 degrees, your financial eighth house. You might devise a plan to lower your credit card balance or student loan debt, or you could consult your financial advisor to make changes to your retirement portfolio to yield better results. Next month will strongly accent finances, and you may be able to find ways to leave the month a lot richer, feeling the blessings of financial security.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>June is a tricky month with planets in a bad mood, stomping around and slamming doors. At the full moon on June 3, Mars will oppose Pluto, and since both rule your sixth house of work and health, the fallout will occur there. Keep an eye on subordinates who report to you personally at home or at work—one worker may be in a feisty mood and challenge your authority, as incredible as that might sound. This could be a draining month, so make it a point to keep to a nutritious diet. Be sure you are getting enough sleep too, for doing so will be essential. Dealing with untoward events is harder to do when you are tired.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>The full moon on June 3 will land in your seventh house of partnerships, so this could shine a light on the character of your romantic or business partner or collaborator. Saturn in Pisces will square off with the Sun in Gemini and the full moon in Sagittarius, so you will have little choice but to face the truth of the situation even if doing so is disillusioning or painful. Not all Gemini will feel this way, however—it could be a peak moment for a relationship when you get engaged or wed. In that case, of course, the full moon would mark a very happy point.</p>
<p>Whatever comes to fruition during this full moon on June 3 will have been going on for some time, but you may not have been aware of all the details as some were concealed. It is always better to know the truth than not, so be philosophical. Mercury, your ruler, will be tightly conjunct Uranus, so this full moon is bound to bring up completely unexpected news straight out of the blue. This is the universe testing you to see how flexible and adaptable you can be—you are a mutable sign, so you will pass this test with flying colors even if you find you don’t like the direction events are taking you.</p>
<p>Come June 17, the new moon in Gemini will be somewhat easier to take than the full moon on June 3 because the atmosphere won’t be as emotional. Still, the planets will not have quite straightened out their conflicts with each other by this point. Neptune will be intent on causing confusion by being in hard angle to this new moon, so you will need to find a way to sift through a situation, separating fact from fiction. Listen to what is said, and also to what is not being said (just as informative). Ask many questions, for few things will be exactly what they seem at first. You will have to dig deep beneath the glossy surface.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>Mercury, your ruler and the ruler of this new moon in Gemini, will be a linchpin and will be in a hard angle to Saturn. This suggests your career will need tending. You appear to be taking on new responsibilities and adjusting to your new role.</p>
<p>One way you can give yourself some relaxation and relief would be by traveling to a sunny location for a few days. You have Venus and Mars, the cosmic lovers, in Leo, the sign of luxury, and for you, that includes travel. Leo is ruled by the Sun, the reason you will look for warmth and sunshine. Both planets are based in your third house of getaways, and having Venus and Mars so close in a compatible sign to yours will make for quite a romantic holiday. Consider going away for a short trip over June 17 and 18, for that weekend will encourage travel. Getting away from your everyday life will give you a fresh perspective, and you will return home energized and renewed.</p>
