        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>You have a lot on your plate, and to keep up, you must feel the need to continue tap dancing with no breaks. Mars, the action planet entered your work-a-day assignment sector (sixth house) last month on May 20 and will stay until July 10, so the steady flow of tasks will keep up at least that long.</p>
<p>Yet it appears you will love your work assignments because Mars’ sweetheart Venus (together they are known as the cosmic lovers) will enter Leo too on June 5 to stay until October 8. (I will tell you why Venus is staying so unusually long in Leo later.) Venus and Mars are rarely together due to their very different orbits, but every once in a while they do meet, and that allows them to spark love and spread happiness.</p>
<p>Although Venus and Mars will not make an exact conjunction this month (their conjunction will happen February 24, 2024, in Aquarius), they nevertheless will orbit together in Leo throughout June and will remain within four and six tiny degrees of each other the entire time. This is easily within mathematical significance, so I feel you will enjoy your work this month very much.</p>
<p>From May 20, Mars has held your forehead straight ahead and made you keep your eyes on the road—concentration has been critical to getting all your projects done. This will continue until July 10, the date Mars will move out of Leo.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>Even though you feel like you are trying to keep up with an assembly line of work, it looks like your hard work is adding up to something big. You will have one of your most important full moons of the year on June 3 in Sagittarius, 13 degrees, in your solar tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement. This points to a moment that your talent and reputation will be appreciated and lauded. Something involving your career is reaching a culmination within five days of June 3.</p>
<p>This will be the most important full moon of the year for your professional interests—you only get one full moon for career during a year, and this one is it. You appear to be having a meeting, interview, or product launch in the first week of June.</p>
<p>Your next big moment for career advancement will arrive at the December 12 new moon in Sagittarius at, again, 13 degrees. (Mars will begin to lay the groundwork by arriving in this same house first, gliding into Sagittarius from November 24 until January 4, 2024.) You will get opportunities in between June and December, but these moments I have listed will be some of your biggest headline months, bringing you the most dramatic news.</p>

        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>Action Mars is currently in your work-a-day house, Leo, and will send an outstandingly supportive beam to the full moon June 3. Mars is the natural ruler of your second house of earned income, so it appears you will earn a raise or good salary at a new job. You seem to be getting a promotion, a new position, or enviable publicity. If you are self-employed, you may bring in a very prestigious client.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Saturn at 7-degrees Pisces will be in hard, square angle to the full moon, so that means any job you discuss will put a considerable weight of responsibility on your shoulders. You seem eager to take it on, however, this job offer does not seem to scare you because you are quite ready for it.</p>
<p>With Saturn playing an important role, if you made any slip-ups at work in the past, those incidents will be brought up at the interview or performance review, so be ready to address them with transparency, honesty, and confidence—you will impress the VIPs more that way. Don’t become defensive. The entire reason you are meeting with VIPs is that they are already impressed with you.</p>
<p>The full moon in the solar Pisces chart brings your creativity and individual way of approaching assignments to the core of the discussion. Showcase this marvelous quality in you, for this quality is what higher-ups prize in you and will want to hear more about. If you can think of examples before you meet, by all means, recount them.</p>
<p>Lastly, Jupiter will hold the final card in play at any full moon in Sagittarius and will reveal the final direction that things will go. Here I am very excited to tell you that this full moon seems to be ready to bring you a far better outcome than you expect. I will explain by showing you what I see.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>Jupiter, the good-fortune planet of luck and financial gain, and Saturn, the great taskmaster that shows you the value of hard work and dedication to a goal, will collaborate in a unique way this month in an aspect on June 19 that will not be repeated for years. This collaboration between Jupiter and Saturn will cast a glow all month and into the first part of July because both are very slow-moving planets. Saturn is all about stability and long-term gain, and Jupiter is known to broaden opportunity and bring generous money. By working with Jupiter and Saturn at this time, in June, you can achieve the kind of financial security you have wanted for a long time.</p>
<p>Your home and immediate family will take your full attention after the new moon of June 17 in Gemini, 27 degrees. New moons change the energy and help you make progress. Last year, as well as early this year (January through most of March), you have been very focused on a family member and how best to help that person. This could be a parent, a sibling, or a child, as some examples.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may have mulled over a question you need to solve regarding whether to move, renovate, or redecorate. You may be interested in buying a house, but I would like you to wait until Jupiter moves into Gemini, your solar fourth house of home, May 25, 2024, to stay until June 2025 for your very best solution.</p>
<p>There is one problem with this new moon—it will receive an obstacle (90-degree square) from Neptune, your ruling planet, to the Sun and new moon. Neptune could make his presence known in one of two ways.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>First, as Neptune is the father of the oceans and all bodies of water, you could experience a flood. If you are choosing a new house or condo to move into, check to find out if the property has ever been harmed by natural disasters or by old and worn internal plumbing. Think twice about buying beach front property under this new moon, especially if it the property is based in a region that regularly receives hurricanes.</p>
<p>Check also to make sure the homeowner living in that property has not had a problem with mold or had to suffer with tainted tap water or, in northern climates, had to remove dangerously heavy snow from the roof. Also, find out if you would have to pay to remodel the plumbing in the walls—ask your appraiser to check out these drawbacks.</p>
<p>In a different manifestation that is trickier, you may have to deal with a family mystery—perhaps something that has puzzled you about part of your family tree for a long time. Neptune clouds information by placing a soft, delicate fog over everything. Neptune makes reality look magical, but if you don’t look closely, it will prove later to be only a dream. If you are interested in property, you must have a lawyer.</p>
<p>The saving grace to this new moon’s final resolve will point to Mercury, the ruler of Gemini. Happily, Mercury will be beautifully oriented to Venus and Mars, so if you love a certain property, keep working to get to the underlying facts that you may not have been told. If you want to improve your home or help a family member, don’t make assumptions, but rather make your plans according to the facts. If you insist on full disclosure, the pieces of your puzzle will fall into place.</p>
<p>Romance and fun will blossom in early July next month, so be patient.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>I need to let you know that Venus will go retrograde in Leo next month from July 22 to September 3 (the day before Labor Day in the US), so Venus will retrograde for six weeks. Venus rules beauty, love, pampering experiences, and money, and all will suffer from not having Venus’ support.</p>
<p>Venus in retrograde would not be the time to schedule plastic surgery, a face lift, Botox, fillers, or cosmetic dentistry. It is not the time to buy a precious gem or a new costly perfume—later you may feel your judgment was off, and you won’t like the results.</p>
<p>Donations to charity events are likely to be lower than expected also, for Venus is associated with money and profits, too.</p>
<p>When it comes to love, if you are single, Venus retrograde would not be a productive time to meet a new love interest. Venus rules warmth, love, and genuine affection, and when out of phase, she cannot beam us her full blessings. You may find the relationship eventually cools off, and you may wonder why all the closeness disappeared.</p>
<p>If you meet someone new in the romantic sense between July 22 and September 3, while Venus is retrograde, you would be building into the “birth” of the relationship a weak, disabled Venus—that is not good. Besides, Mercury will retrograde too during part of the Venus’ retrograde—Mercury will go out of phase from August 23 to September 15. For all practical purposes, the last two weeks of September will bring a much better environment to engender love. You can also circulate in June—this is a nice month for that!</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>If you are in a serious, long-term relationship or are married, you will not be affected too much by Venus retrograde, for you met long before Venus went retrograde. During this period, everyone brings things down a notch and sticks to the status quo. You may decide to stay home more, but that can be fun, too. You can cook up delicious meals together and after, watch a critically acclaimed movie on one of the streaming services.</p>
<p>Romance comes from within, not from where you go or what you do. Pisces has always known that—you can create a poetic, tender and romantic evening better than any sign, thanks to your rich imagination, dear Pisces. You never have to spend much money to enjoy true and enduring love.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>As June begins, your career is reaching an important moment on or near June 3, the full moon in Sagittarius. Mars in Leo, your work-a-day sector, will send a positive beam to the full moon, indicating work projects will go well. VIPs will tell you that your work projects are excellent and appreciated. At the same time, you may encounter a forceful person of authority—possibly a client or person in management—who seems to be impossible to placate. This can be quite tension-producing, especially since this person seems to be questioning your judgment or skills.</p>
<p>Do your best to politely answer questions directed toward you without being combative or defensive. You may feel your work is above reproach, but the person in question is used to getting his own way by being bossy. Take your time. This person will likely return from his difficult position when Pluto slides back into Capricorn after June 11.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>Meanwhile, Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, entered your communications sector last month on May 16 to remain a full 12 months. Jupiter will give you the right words to soothe any turbulent relationship you might be dealing with lately, especially the one brought to your attention at this full moon. Jupiter will also help you to create a good contractual agreement if need be.</p>
<p>Overall, your daily work life is busier than ever. If, however, you find yourself displaced from work, you will be able to find new work similar to the type of work you did before. If you would rather work independently, you will be able to attract one-time projects from clients that you can do while you search for your ideal job. In fact, you may find business is so brisk that it is time to start your own business.</p>
<p>Venus and Mars will both be in your work-a-day assignment sector, a sure indication of your popularity among co-workers and subordinates who report to you. This month you will have no problem attracting workers who are qualified and who can add to your reputation for excellence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a new day is dawning in regard to a family member or within your own living arrangements this month. The new moon of June 17 is about to bring proof of this, and you seem happy to take your eyes off career for the moment to focus on your parents and your private life for the several weeks that follow this new moon.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>If you want to buy or rent a new place to live, rent a vacation cottage, or perhaps do renovations, keep in mind that Neptune will be clouding some parts of the deal. In particular, due to your ruler’s, Neptune, hard position to this new moon, you will need to focus on problems that water can bring. Ask many questions about the property and its history, especially if you are making an investment. Costs, of course, will be another important consideration, and the planetary patterns suggest you are being careful and circumspect before taking action.</p>
<p>Saturn in Pisces shows you are ready to build a foundation to your life, to start a stable home and family, and that you are willing to put in the effort to get things right. In hindsight you will see those actions you are taking now through March 2026 (three years from now when Saturn is due to leave Pisces) allowed you to build upon what you set in place. The choices you make now, in 2024 and 2025, will pay you spiritual and financial dividends well into the future, possibly forever.</p>
<p>Additionally, the June 19 collaboration of disciplined Saturn in Pisces with good-fortune Jupiter in Taurus at 7 degrees will make this month a standout and rinse the entire month of June with golden light. This aspect will not happen again for many years—so take this seriously. The actions and decisions you make now in June can provide you with a steady stream of income for a very long time and bring you the kind of financial security you always dreamed of building.</p>




        <h2>Your June Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>Pisces born February 25 or February 26, plus or minus three days, will feel this aspect involving Jupiter and Saturn directly and will get a double dose of luck.</p>
<p>Although you can feel criticized at times from a stern VIP, due to Saturn in Pisces, don’t let that break your spirit. Take the feedback, and find ways to improve, but don’t let those words crush you. Jupiter is in your communications sector, suggesting something you are doing that involves writing, speaking, editing, or coding will have lasting value.</p>
<p>Jupiter and Saturn will not make another aspect like the one June 19 again for years. You are in a very fertile time—start something new in the communications area.</p>
