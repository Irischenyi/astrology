        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p><strong>Your October forecast is shorter than usual due to a severe eye infection I got earlier in September. Please be sure to read News From Susan Miller for a full explanation.</strong></p>
<p>You may not have had a chance to travel over the past three months, so October would be the perfect time to spin your compass and take off to parts unknown. Just a few days before you entered this month, you had a full moon in Aries, 6 degrees, on September 29 in your short-distance travel sector. You may have taken a short little weekend trip, perhaps one that afforded you a chance to participate in sports. That trip was just your appetizer, so it looks like a more important trip is coming after the new moon solar eclipse occurs on October 14 in Libra.</p>
<p>Mars has been heating up this same ninth house sector since August 27, so you may have been planning the trip you will soon take since then. Mars will leave Libra on October 11, having made you excited about the idea of bursting out of your everyday routine and seeing what the world has to offer you.</p>




        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>Just as Mars is making his exit from your ninth house of distant travel, you will see the new moon solar eclipse at 21 degrees Libra, this same travel area of your chart, on October 14. In the weeks to follow, that eclipse will open the door to many opportunities to pack and go. This eclipse of October 14 will help you shape up plans. Venus will take the lead at this eclipse but will oppose Saturn, so you seem to have work or other obligations to take care of before you can think of leaving town.</p>
<p>Money may also be a concern. You seem to have many expenses coming up, so you may not be in the mood to spend a lot on a trip. You may want to look at a number of vacation packages first to see if you can land a bargain. By October, most crowds have disbursed, so you have a good chance of finding a too-good-to-miss travel package.</p>

        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>You will have other major concerns going on in October. Mars will enter Scorpio on October 11 and stay until November 24, and during that time he will light up your career sector (your prestigious tenth house of professional reputation and advancement). If you are in the market for a new position, Mars will help you get in to see the influential VIPs who can help you. Work hard to make appointments, and get your CV polished and up to date because the new moon next month on November 13 will be your gateway to the better job that you have in mind. Much will depend on what you do now before you reach that dateâ€”you can land the glittering job you want, but you must prepare.</p>
<p>Many Aquarians have been moving, buying, and selling property due to the eclipses in the Scorpio-Taurus series that started in November 2021. Eclipses came by every six months in pairs, and you are coming to the last one this month on October 28 in Taurus, 5 degrees. This one will focus on your home again, and there will be no more eclipses in this series after this one, not until 2031-2032.</p>
<p>This October 28 eclipse is the sweetest eclipse of all in this series, for the full moon will orbit with Jupiter, shoulder to shoulder. Jupiter will give you good fortune and luck, and if you are not focused on your physical home or other property, you may be working to help a family member financially or emotionally (or both). This eclipse will finalize a plan and possibly move up your timetable. For once, you have an eclipse that will make you very happy. Rejoice!</p>
