        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p><strong>Your October forecast is shorter than usual due to a severe eye infection I got earlier in September. Please be sure to read News From Susan Miller for a full explanation.</strong></p>
<p>As October dawns, you have just enjoyed a full moon in Aries, your house of home and family, on September 29 at 6 degrees. All full moons are influential for five days, so the energy for that full moon will take you to October 4. You might have visited your mother and father, or vice versa, they may have visited you, or you may have hosted a dinner party at your home. Family support of your goals should be strong, and if you need a loan from family, ask—you are likely to get it in early October.</p>
<p>Mars has been circulating in the highest region of your chart, your tenth house of professional honors, awards, and achievement for the first time in two years. Mars has been raising your profile and allowing you to show others all you have to offer. Mars first entered this career-oriented portion of your chart on August 27 and will stay until October 11. It is considered quite a privilege to have Mars at your side to help in any part of life. This is a good time to be thinking about your career, so if you are ready to take on a promotion or new job, start looking, update your résumé, and make appointments.</p>




        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>When Mars leaves Libra on October 11, almost immediately the new moon solar eclipse will come to light this same portion of your solar chart, Libra (21 degrees), on October 14. Eclipses are very powerful and will open a threshold to new opportunities and offers. Venus and Mars are in strong agreement, suggesting a friend or acquaintance you met at a professional club or conference could be very instrumental in helping you get ahead.</p>
<p>This does not mean the new job will be a total shoo-in to win—you will have to remain sharp—for you will face some competition. Nevertheless, you will be looked at seriously by VIPs. The more specific, practical, and budget-friendly the idea(s) you offer a prospective employer, the better. Displaying those qualities will place you in the lead. It may take time to get the answer whether you won the job—Venus and Saturn will be in opposition, so management will be in no rush to name a candidate. Be patient. All will come in time.</p>

        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>In the meantime, you have another eclipse, a full moon lunar eclipse in Taurus, 5 degrees, on October 28 to light your fifth house of true love. This is a lovely diversion from all the career matters going on in your life. If you have been dating someone seriously, this eclipse may bring a decision point—to stay and commit or to leave without regret. I feel you will be thrilled with the answer, for the full moon will be conjunct Jupiter, and Uranus, planet of surprise, will be in elegant angle to Venus. It looks like you have Cupid’s recipe for outstanding romance. An engagement or wedding may be on the agenda. If you are already wed, you may be making big plans together for the future. If having a baby is on your wish list, this eclipse might bring news. Eclipses often bring events that you long remember.</p>
<p>Single? You could meet someone new while on a trip that would require a passport (even a next-door country would count), or you may meet someone at a party who has a different background from you—the person may speak with an accent—but lives in your city. The other likely place for you to meet that special someone would be while taking higher education courses, in college or graduate school, or while taking special courses to update your knowledge of your industry.</p>
