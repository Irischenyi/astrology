        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p><strong>Your October forecast is shorter than usual due to a severe eye infection I got earlier in September. Please be sure to read News From Susan Miller for a full explanation.</strong></p>
<p>October will focus you strongly on money management. You are three-quarters of the way through 2023, so it’s a good time to get organized. The full moon of late last month on September 29 in Aries, 6 degrees, had you paying bills and dealing with personal money matters. One check you had to write may have been large, one that you anticipated and planned to send. If you asked for a raise, you are likely to have received the answer.</p>
<p>You will become more interested in streamlining your finances this month after October 14 due to the coming new moon solar eclipse in Libra, 21 degrees, which will increase your motivation to get started then and in the weeks to follow. Your strongest and most helpful energy from this eclipse will occur in the first week AFTER the eclipse appears. You may be writing or refining your will, doing estate planning, or designating a proxy. If you owe money to a creditor or government for taxes and you can’t pay, you will need to set up a payment plan—October is a good month to do so.</p>
<p>If you sent a claim to your insurance company or applied for a grant, you will likely get your answer mid-month. Alternatively, if you applied for a mortgage, bank loan, business line of credit, or venture capital, that answer will likely arrive after October 14. Are you a college student? If the amount your institution awarded you for financial aid is lower than you expected, by all means, send a well-written appeal. The house that the eclipse will light up in your chart is the house of other people’s money.</p>




        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>If you are in the process of a divorce, and at the point of deciding how the property should be divided, the October 14 eclipse will also be a good time to open negotiations with your soon-to-be ex.</p>
<p>On another topic, you have been working hard, so it is doubtful that you’ve had time to travel in July, August, or September, but when Mars moves into compatible water-sign Scorpio, that will change. Mars will give you the travel bug from October 11 to November 24. You may be heading to a foreign country that requires your passport for entry sometime just after the new moon (not an eclipse) of November 13.</p>
<p>Connected to this growing theme of travel is the full moon lunar eclipse in Taurus, 5 degrees, on October 28, which could trigger a short, close-to-home trip. If so, you will find this trip very special—Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck will be attached to this full moon in Taurus, and you will likely enjoy the environment and accommodations. If you are involved in working with executives abroad and have international relationships, a large client will likely come in. Import-export of goods and services are favored, too</p>
<blockquote><p>A very romantic weekend for “just us two” this month will arrive on Saturday, October 21, when Venus will receive a blizzard of happy feelings from Jupiter.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>This eclipse may also bring up a contract or other important paper to sign—be sure you show it to your lawyer. At eclipse time there is a lot of static in the air, and you could easily overlook a troublesome clause. Your lawyer’s advice will be worth his weight in gold.</p>
<p>Jupiter’s position from now until May 25, 2024, shows that you are very fortunate with projects involving writing, speaking, editing, researching, and translating. This includes work on podcasts, web designs, games, apps, or other digital projects. This area will shine for you straight through May 25, 2024. If you like, take courses to get even better at the skills you might need to sharpen so that you can take full advantage of this wonderful energy being brought to you by Jupiter.</p>
<p>When it comes to romance, the attached Pisces will have the edge this month because Venus will be sending her best wishes to couples from your seventh house of marriage and commitment from October 8 to November 8.</p>
<p>Your very most romantic evening this month will arrive on Saturday, October 21, when Venus will receive a blizzard of happy feelings from Jupiter in your third house of travel. This would be a great weekend for “just us two”—to drive to a beautiful nearby spot and stay overnight in a luxury hotel. Or stay home and buy tickets to a show, ballet, or concert, and afterwards, plan to have a candle-lit dinner in a special-occasion restaurant. Cupid and his little fleet of angels will be watching over you both to make it all you dream it to be.</p>
