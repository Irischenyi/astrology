        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p><strong>Your October forecast is shorter than usual due to a severe eye infection I got earlier in September. Please be sure to read News From Susan Miller for a full explanation.</strong></p>
<p>As you begin October, you may need a little rest after wrapping up a large project near the September 29 full moon in Aries, 6 degrees, which will still be strong in the first four days of October. You may be adding details and special touches before you ship the project. You are clearly working behind the scenes this month in a highly strategic role, especially since your ruler Mars remains in Libra, a quiet, hidden place of your chart that he has occupied since August 27. At that full moon last month on September 29, you likely received fabulous reviews for your work (or you soon will), for Mars, strong at the full moon, was (and continues to be) in conversation with Venus in Leo, your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement. Clearly, VIPs are impressed with your style, creativity, and sound judgment.</p>
<p>Mars will enter Scorpio on October 11 to stay until November 24, which will prove to be the most powerful period of 2023 for you. The period of staying low key will be over, and the strategy you worked so hard to form will now start to take shape.</p>
<p>During those six weeks, you will be in the spotlight.</p>




        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>Nevertheless, at the October 14 new moon solar eclipse in Libra, you will still be working on strategy. Libra, your twelfth house of behind-the-scenes work, will be filled with celestial bodies—the Sun, new moon eclipse, and Mercury. The Sun governs your career, so that is where your thoughts will be directed.</p>
<p>At this eclipse Venus will oppose Saturn, so certain constraints may frustrate you. They may have to do with budgets or with creative ideas that can’t quite be materialized. Still, Venus will cozy up to Mars, so your determination and persistence could easily prevail—it appears you will not let any obstacle stand in your way, not even a “no.” You seem intent on figuring out ways this situation can still be workable, and you may sense a solution is near.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pluto, your other ruler, watching what is going on, will reach out from your communication house to Uranus in a rare, sparkling aspect. It appears someone you partner with at work in a one-to-one relationship will help you in a surprising way. The person being accented in your chart is a person such as your accountant, lawyer, agent, or publicist, similar to the way a photographer would work with an art director or a screenwriter would collaborate with a writing partner. A person who holds this type of role in your life will be fortunate for you, and working together you can generate an imaginative, unique idea.</p>
<blockquote><p>At the full moon lunar eclipse in Taurus on October 28, you will be in your strongest position all month, moving from offstage to center stage, your rightful place.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>Also, within a few days after the eclipse arrives on October 14, you may hear a secret that someone has kept from you. You will start to understand things that had puzzled you previously, and you may wish you had known the information that had been withheld sooner. At least you’ll know now what you need to know, and you can make more plans accordingly. Eclipses are no ordinary lunations—they carry extra weight and importance.</p>
<p>The theme of combining forces with a partner will grow much bigger two weeks later at the full moon lunar eclipse in Taurus on October 28, 5 degrees. The moon will appear with Jupiter at her arm, a fantastic situation, for it shows how happy and profitable this union will be. Off to the side, Uranus will signal Venus with a shimmering beam, adding a vibrancy to this full moon eclipse. You may be getting engaged or wed, or you may be taking on a close business partner or collaborator at work with an equal sense of happy anticipation.</p>
<p>You will be in the strongest position you’ve been all month for several reasons. The Sun will have moved into Scorpio (October 23), favoring you (no small advantage), and you will have Mars and Mercury in Scorpio as well. Finally—you are moving from offstage to center stage, your rightful place to be.</p>




        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>You may notice an international influence at this eclipse on October 28 too, which might mean you will be traveling to a distant city. It seems you will be excited and protected by events.</p>
<p>The eclipse October 28 might trigger a decision point, so I should add that if you have not been happy, you might decide to leave an important relationship that you would describe as a partnership. This seems far less likely, for Jupiter’s strong role at this eclipse suggests you will be happy with the result, perhaps free of the relationship at last.</p>
<p>Lunar eclipses are far more powerful than regular full moons, and they can be life-changing. The closer your birthday falls to October 28, the more you will be affected by this eclipse. Stay optimistic—having good-fortune Jupiter conjunct the full moon is a powerfully good aspect and should bring joy and elation. Additionally, Saturn, the Sun, and full moon eclipse will all be in collaboration, adding a comforting sense of stability. This is the last of a string of eclipses in your sign and opposite sign of Taurus that have created massive changes in your life over the past two years. It seems fitting that this family of eclipses should end with a positive, rewarding one.</p>
