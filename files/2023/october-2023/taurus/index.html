        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p><strong>Your October forecast is shorter than usual due to a severe eye infection I got earlier in September. Please be sure to read News From Susan Miller for a full explanation.</strong></p>
<p>This will be a big month for you, for this month holds the last eclipse in the Taurus-Scorpio family of signs, which have turned your life upside down at times since this series of eclipses began on November 19, 2021. These eclipses arrived in pairs, two weeks apart every six months over the course of nearly two years. There is no reason to dread this last one, though, for this will be a friendly full moon lunar eclipse at 5 degrees Taurus that is due on October 28. At that time, something dearly important to you will end, and something new, and equally important, will begin.</p>
<p>Eclipses keep us moving forward. They don’t let us go back to former times—you will soon see the only path open to you will be the one that lies ahead. Eclipses will always move up timetables, clarify situations, and if necessary, pull you out of an unproductive relationship or circumstance that it feels is of no future value to you. Eclipses also can bring reward and sudden opportunity, so stay alert enough to recognize good fortune when it surfaces. In all cases, you will need to partner with the universe by making an effort to work toward what you hope to achieve. If you do, and you are under a favorable eclipse, the universe will meet you more than half-way, and extend a hand to you to get you where you are striving to be.</p>




        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>Let’s look at the rest of the month, starting at the top. As you begin October, you may be in a romantic mood. The full moon in Aries, 6 degrees, lit your very private part of your chart on September 29, so you may want to devote your greatest attention to those you love and who matter most. Uranus, the planet of surprises, is currently in Taurus and reached out to Mercury in Virgo, your house of true love (and Mercury also RULES your house of true love, doubling its effect). This suggests you may hear from an old love, or from a current love who you were hoping would call you.</p>
<p>Venus, the love goddess, will enter this important part of your chart only a week later, on October 8, to stay until November 8. This suggests that October should bring a number of thrilling social activities. Saturday, October 21 could easily work out to be your favorite day for romance, with Venus in lovely conversation with benefic Jupiter.</p>

        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>You will experience a different eclipse mid-month, October 14—this will be a new moon solar eclipse in Libra, appearing at 21 degrees. It will fall in your sixth house of workplace, and that is where you will see changes. You may see staff changes or changes in assignments or clients. If management is on a streamlining initiative—cutting staff to become more profitable—everyone’s workload will increase, including yours. This seems likely as Saturn will oppose the dominant planet of this eclipse, Venus. Teamwork will be the best way to handle the coming situation. If all workers are rowing in the same direction, with equal energy and enthusiasm, there is nothing you can’t conquer.</p>
<p>The same house that governs work projects also rules the preventative measures you take to stay healthy. The October 14 eclipse may drain you a bit, so catch up on extra sleep, and keep up with routine doctor appointments. And check-ups. You might be juggling a lot of detail, and you will need to take steps to stay strong. If you do, you will be able to deal with just about anything that comes up.</p>
