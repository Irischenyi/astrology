        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p><strong>Your October forecast is shorter than usual due to a severe eye infection I got earlier in September. Please be sure to read News From Susan Miller for a full explanation.</strong></p>
<p>October is an easier month for you than the months you have experienced recently. You will feel productive and not have the delays and uncertainty you felt in earlier months. October does hold eclipses, but they are far milder than the ones you experienced before.</p>
<p>Let’s start at the top of October, when you will still be feeling the effects of the friendly Aries full moon, 6 degrees, on September 29, influencing you in the first days of October. As you enter October, you might be coming back from a distant trip, or you may be concluding a project with a client who is based in an overseas city. It’s also possible you flew away for a vacation, returning home over the weekend of September 28-29. The house that was lit by September’s full moon was your ninth house, an intellectual sector encouraging curiosity, learning, study, and travel.</p>




        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>If you are an undergraduate or graduate student, you might have recently handed in a paper or taken a mid-term test on or near September 29. If you work in the media, you will be wrapping a communications project (such as a podcast, manuscript, or report) within five days beyond the full moon, September 29.</p>
<p>Later, a new moon solar eclipse will appear on October 14 in Libra, 21 degrees. At that time, you may be negotiating a contract, and if so, with Venus opposed to Saturn, talks will proceed slowly and cautiously. You may need to travel a short distance to conclude a deal or to collaborate on a project to smooth out details face-to-face. You might face obstacles, but soon you will find the solution. Solar eclipses usually open a new chapter, so an opportunity is there for you to scoop up. By being willing to tackle the hard projects, you will build a reputation as an imaginative—and at the same time realistic—problem solver. You will be very much in demand.</p>

        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>Speaking of your reputation, you have a very exciting full moon lunar eclipse to look forward to on October 28. This eclipse will shine from Taurus at 5 degrees. Eclipses often bring big changes, ones we long remember. Over the past two years, you’ve endured numerous eclipses, most notably the one on November 8, 2022. That and the last one, May 5, 2023, were tough to endure, especially if your birthday falls within four days of July 28 or in the first week of August. The coming full moon eclipse should bring only good news about your growing stature in your industry and how well you are regarded by higher-ups. A promotion or offer from another firm is also possible as a result of this mainly positive full moon lunar eclipse October 28.</p>
<p>As you see, this is a busy month. Watch for romance to come to life next month from November 24 until January 4, 2024. Start getting ready now with pretty or dashing wardrobe items that you will want to wear at the many festive gatherings you’ll be invited to at that time.</p>
