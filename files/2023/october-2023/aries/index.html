        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p><strong>Your October forecast is shorter than usual due to a severe eye infection I got earlier in September. Please be sure to read News From Susan Miller for a full explanation.</strong></p>
<p>As you enter October, you are just finishing up an important full moon in Aries, 6 degrees, on September 29 that may have brought something to an important conclusion or apex in your life, most likely involving a current relationship or one once dear to you. At the start of October, you have love-me Venus, now in direct orbit in Leo, your house of true love, receiving sparkling vibrations from your ruler Mars in your marriage/partnership/commitment sector.</p>
<p>You may be planning your soon-to-be new life, having recently married the person you love, and are in the process of agreeing on a vital new goal you will work on together. Alternatively, you may be working on a collaborative venture regarding a creative project.</p>




        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>Mars will move through your financial eighth house from October 11 to November 24, when you will concentrate intently on setting up a firm financial plan for the future. You may be taking care of important paperwork: creating or refining your will or estate planning, dealing with an inheritance, or filing for an insurance payout, as some examples. You also may find that during this period you will spend more money than usual. You may have put off purchases but now need those items or know you will need to write a large check, such as for tuition, a down payment on a car, or for another financial promise you made earlier.</p>
<p>It is also possible you will begin Christmas shopping now, for Mercury will go retrograde on December 13 until January 1, 2024, and you will feel the slowdown that this phase of Mercury brings at least two weeks prior than the official start date. Retail inventory will be low this year, and if you wait to shop too close to the holidays, you may be disappointed when a number of items will be sold out. Shop early and enjoy a more relaxed holiday.</p>

        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>The new moon solar eclipse in Libra at 21 degrees due October 14 will help you solidify your long-range plans with your significant other, perhaps sooner than you had planned. You will have the Sun, new moon, and Mercury (communication) in your seventh house of marriage and established partnerships. Aries is an independent sign, but even you will begin to realize that two can be “better together”—you can accomplish more in life if you have a trusted, supportive partner at your side. Eclipses often bring major life events, and with Venus taking the lead at this Libra new moon, and at the same time opposing Saturn, you will be extremely cautious with every move you make. That’s not a drawback—it’s good, for you will think through all your moves.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, the full moon lunar eclipse in Taurus, 5 degrees, on October 28 will fall in your second house of income and suggests a new source of earnings will commence. Pluto will be cranky and demand a lot of effort from you for the work you do. Nevertheless, Venus will be positioned in your work-a-day sector, so the money you receive will not be a gift, nor will it be won, but rather earned, and the sum should be quite generous. Every indication is that you will be pleased with the salary you settle on. This eclipse will conjoin Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, fulfilling Jupiter’s promise that 2023 would become Aries’ best financial year in this decade.</p>
