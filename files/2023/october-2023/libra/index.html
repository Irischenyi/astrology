        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p><strong>Your October forecast is shorter than usual due to a severe eye infection I got earlier in September. Please be sure to read News From Susan Miller for a full explanation.</strong></p>
<p>Your spouse may now make headlines in your life, for your thoughts are on your spouse, steady sweetheart, or alternatively, a business partner. Additionally, a sum of money seems to be heading your way, much to your surprise. It might come in the form of a commission, bonus, royalty, or gift, or it may come as an inheritance, insurance payout, bank loan, infusion of venture capital, or a mortgage. One of these areas may resonate with you, for it is thanks to the full moon of September 29 in Aries (6 degrees), which will still be strong and influential in the first four days of October.</p>
<p>You have a lot of control over events, for Mars is in Libra, and that’s a wonderful privilege that happens every two years for an approximate six-week visit. (Mars first came to Libra on August 27 and will leave October 11, an important period for you.) Fortunately, Mars is reaching out to his cosmic lover Venus, so the outcome of this September 29 full moon should be happy, with friends close and reasons to celebrate each others’ news. You will notice the effects of that full moon until October 4.</p>




        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>Your significant other will likely be announcing an entrepreneurial enterprise, and you seem supportive. Mercury will oppose Neptune, though, so make sure your partner does a deep dive into the new endeavor that he or she is entering—there will be more facts to unearth.</p>
<p>The spotlight will soon turn to you at the new moon solar eclipse in Libra, 21 degrees, on October 14—watch the 10 days that follow this date. The closer your birthday falls to October 14, the more likely you will feel the message of the eclipse. (You may have already felt it on September 14, plus seven days, or will feel this eclipse on or near November 14, plus 10 days, as eclipses can be felt one month before or after they occur, but most people will feel it this month.) New moons open a new door, so stay alert to a new opportunity that seems work-related and leans toward tapping your creative talents.</p>

        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>Once Mars moves into Scorpio on October 11, you will begin spending more money, which appears to be directed to family and items for your home. If the drain is too much, appeal to your mother or father for financial help—your chart suggests (through Pluto) that one or both of your parents will be sympathetic and may be able to help bridge some of your larger expenses.</p>
<p>Money will again be on your mind at the full moon lunar eclipse at 5 degrees Taurus on October 28 and should bring you good news. The moon in your solar chart is always linked to your prestigious tenth house of career, reputation, and advancement, so you may be getting a new position or a promotion with a higher salary, or if you are self-employed, a new, generous client. You will do better if your compensation is linked to performance—such as a commission, royalty, residual, or bonus for work well done. Good-fortune Jupiter will tightly accompany this full moon and see that you feel financial luck. So, the sky’s the limit—ask for what you feel is fair.</p>
