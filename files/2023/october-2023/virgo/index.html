        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p><strong>Your October forecast is shorter than usual due to a severe eye infection I got earlier in September. Please be sure to read News From Susan Miller for a full explanation.</strong></p>
<p>Last month, the full moon in Aries, 6 degrees, lit your financial eighth house of other people’s money on September 29, and you seem to have been paying bills and meeting at least one major obligation. With Mars in your second house of Libra, your financial salary sector, it’s clear that your spending has been unusually high. That outgo will simmer down once Mars leaves Libra on October 11, but in the meantime, you may be on a mission in October to review your expenses and to delete items that are not giving you pleasure or value for their cost.</p>
<p>You may also be determined to find a source of income to supplement your present wages or perhaps a new position to replace your salary with a more lucrative one. The visit of Mars that started August 27 has an important purpose—to fuel your ambitions. By the time you get to the new moon solar eclipse of October 14, on the heels of Mars’ departure October 11, you will be eager to look for a new pipeline of money.</p>




        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>If you are looking for a new source of income, you are in luck—the new moon solar eclipse in Libra, 21 degrees, on October 14 will be your friend. New moon eclipses dramatically open doors, and you may receive one or even two job proposals. Take those opportunities seriously, for you will be in a fine position to grasp your goal. You may encounter one obstacle, and that will come in the form of a partner or spouse who seems not to be convinced of your plans and may try to change your mind about taking an offer.</p>
<p>It’s alternatively possible that instead of a partner or spouse who needs to be convinced of your goal, you may instead face strong competition from other recruits for the job you want, forcing you to find a way to polish your presentation and more clearly delineate your talents, experience, and skills for the job. Your asking salary may also pose an obstacle, for it seems that your competitor may be asking for less, even though that person is older and more experienced than you. Still, you may be able to use your youth to your advantage.</p>

        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Virgo</h2>
        <p>Foreign people and markets are fortunate for you now, something you will see at the lunar eclipse, at the full moon at 5 degrees in Taurus on October 28. At this time, a female international client, agent, or negotiator will be lucky for you and go the distance to help you. If you need to travel far to finish up a deal, the end of October would be the time to go.</p>
<p>Venus is taking the lead here and will oppose Neptune, indicating you may not have all the facts to make an informed decision. In another interpretation of this aspect, the other party you are dealing with might be deliberately withholding pertinent details. You need to verify facts and dig around a bit if your intuition tells you there is more to the story than you are being told.</p>
<p>Halloween, October 31, should be a standout this year. Venus in Virgo will be in sweet harmony (a trine) to Uranus in Taurus, and Uranus is the planet of surprise. Costumes are due to be unusually creative. Give a party or go to one, or plan a party for the little ones who love the chance to dress up in a costume and get candy. This should be a very enjoyable night, and with Venus in Virgo, you will be the star of any gathering.</p>
