        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p><strong>Your October forecast is shorter than usual due to a severe eye infection I got earlier in September. Please be sure to read News From Susan Miller for a full explanation.</strong></p>
<p>Late last month, the full moon of September 29 in Aries, 6 degrees, put you in the mood to spend more time with your friends. You’ve been concentrating intensely on work, and Saturn nearly forced you to keep your hands on the steering wheel and your eyes on the road. You are taking on more responsibility (if not yet, it will happen soon), and it has become vital that you show an eager, energetic, and willing attituded. With a lot of new things to learn, you may feel in need of a break—October will give you that. That September full moon will bring several not-to-be-missed invitations from friends in the first days of October.</p>
<p>Additionally, Mars is busy bringing vibrant energy to your fifth house of true love, romance, fun, vacations, sports, and leisure, so Mars is giving you more evidence that life is about to get much more interesting and enjoyable. Among all the various places you go to this month, you will meet new people, and you may also make the acquaintance of someone who will intrigue you in a romantic way, so you’ll want to spend time to get to know this person better.</p>
<p>Mars will leave this fun, social portion of your chart on October 11, but no worries, almost immediately, the most important aspect of the month for you, the new moon solar eclipse, will arrive on October 14 in Libra, 21 degrees, and set off an important trend involving your love life. This same eclipse may also bring possibilities for you regarding children (or a pregnancy).</p>

        <p>Alternatively, if you are not interested in starting a romantic relationship or having a child, you can direct this energy into starting an imaginative, artistic project. This is a new moon, made much more powerful due to the fact that it’s an eclipse, which usually heralds an important life initiation—one that you may remember for a long time.</p>
<p>Turning to another subject, you will be highly intuitive—at times friends may even tell you that lately you seem downright psychic—due to the collaboration between Pluto in the eighth house and Uranus in the twelfth house of your solar chart. This is a powerful and rare aspect—I would say this aspect’s meaning comes out of textbook astrology. You’ve not experienced this aspect yet in your lifetime as the planets involved are extremely slow-moving. With a wellspring as deep and as rich as your subconscious, you can pick up tiny clues in life unconsciously, leading you to brilliant and creative ideas. Believe in yourself and your hunches. They are there for a reason—to protect you.</p>
<p>The magical, romantic atmosphere of October will be interrupted by the move of Mars into Scorpio (October 11 until November 24) along with a full moon lunar eclipse in Taurus, to arrive on October 28 at 5 degrees. This is the last eclipse in a series that has been arriving very six months in pairs in Taurus and its opposite sign of Scorpio for two years. This eclipse will likely culminate a project or office situation.</p>

        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>At the same time, you are likely to hear about a confidential matter that, until now, was kept under wraps. Once you know the secret, you will wish you had been told sooner, but at least it solves a puzzling situation that previously had nagged at you. With Jupiter in Taurus, your interests are being protected by higher-ups, and a woman executive seems to have great faith in you. You will see this to be true almost immediately when the eclipse arrives October 28.</p>
<p>Within days of October 28, you may see changes at the office. Staff may change—and some may be let go. Although you may be initially upset to see these changes, when you hire a replacement, you will see the eclipse has favored you with a better employee, one that will more eagerly help you and offer a different set of skills. Financially, you appear to benefit at this eclipse. Jupiter will conjoin the moon, so it looks like changes will increase profits—a generous sum of money seems to be heading to you.</p>
<p>Another possible outcome of this October 28 eclipse is that you may see the end of a health protocol, such as finishing up physical therapy, recovery from an operation, results from recent tests that will lead to a new prognosis, as some examples. With Jupiter so close to the moon, news should turn out to be welcome. Or if you have had a mysterious illness, you can now get a solid diagnosis at long last so that the healing can begin.</p>
