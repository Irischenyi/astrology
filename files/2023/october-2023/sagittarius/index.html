        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p><strong>Your October forecast is shorter than usual due to a severe eye infection I got earlier in September. Please be sure to read News From Susan Miller for a full explanation.</strong></p>
<p>The first half of October will be social and will likely bring plenty of fun. You just came through a full moon in Aries, 6 degrees, on September 29, which may have brought breathtaking romance or a touching experience with a child. That full moon’s influence will continue through October 4, so if you did not notice this outcome yet, you still could feel it. You may have a chance to travel—always a Sagittarian’s favorite activity—in the first week of October.</p>
<p>The sector of your solar horoscope where this full moon appeared—your fifth house—also rules your creative expressions, so you may have just wrapped an important creative project.</p>
<p>Mars is adding to the theme of socializing more, for Mars has been in Libra, your eleventh house of joy and friendship, since August 27 and will remain until October 11. This house also rules your deepest hopes and wishes, and you may be getting closer to a long-held goal that you were not sure you’d ever reach. Don’t be sad to see Mars go on October 11—the universe has more plans for you in regard to this very special area of your chart, which is gleaming for you. I will explain now.</p>




        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>On October 14 a new moon solar eclipse will arrive in Libra, 21 degrees, on the heels of Mars’ departure, and add more energy to your eleventh house. You will be seeing many of your friends now, and there is a good chance you will be making new friends, too. You may be going to a wedding, special party, a convention or seminar, or a retreat with several friends.</p>
<p>In another way this could work out, you might choose to volunteer for a charity or a humanitarian or community effort—this eclipse will help you make a big difference to a group that suffers and desperately needs ideas, awareness, and funding. You might feel compelled to roll up your sleeves.</p>
<p>Turning now to your career and work, projects seem to be going exceptionally well and running smoothly. Your ruler Jupiter is in your work-a-day house of Taurus—your sixth house of assignments. It appears you are getting the kind of projects you like, can learn from, and can make good money from, too. If you are self-employed, business is likely brisk.</p>
<blockquote><p>The moon in your chart rules one of your financial houses, so at the full moon lunar eclipse October 28, you may be given a one-time generous sum of money.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>Speaking of your work, the lunar full moon eclipse of October 28 in Taurus, 5 degrees, will put even greater emphasis on this area of your life. Because an eclipse will often “eclipse out” a person from your immediate environment, this indicates it would be a person who works in your office. This person would possibly be your assistant, IT technician, or agent, or you may lose a helper at home, such as your nanny, babysitter, or housekeeper. It is always stressful to see a trusted member of your staff or household leave, but this October 28 lunar eclipse will be working in your favor.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, the aspects of this full moon sparkle, so this suggests you will find a replacement who will offer additional skills you didn’t know you needed and will be glad to have.</p>
<p>If you do need to hire one or more recruits so that you can get the work out more quickly, you will be able to find the right candidates. You will find people who will add to the team and make everyone look good—no easy task, but you will! Take your projects seriously, for the results you achieve this year will count strongly toward a promotion in early March 2024 (if you didn’t get one last month, which is very possible).</p>
<p>There are other possible results. The company may move headquarters or get new electronic equipment. The full moon of October 28 will arrive conjunct Jupiter, the benefic planet of good fortune and also your ruling planet. Saturn will be supremely supportive of the Sun and full moon eclipse too, so your actions will have long-term benefits and lend a sense of security.</p>




        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>The moon in your chart rules one of your financial houses, so at this time, you may be given a one-time generous sum of money. No matter how you look at this, you will win. All eclipses have a second act, so be patient. Sometimes an eclipse takes a few weeks to reveal its entire message. It looks like you are heading to a better place.</p>
<p>Mars will move into Scorpio on October 11 to stay until November 24. During this period, you will work much of your time behind the scenes, perhaps by doing research or writing in a quiet place. You will be getting ready for the moment Mars will enter Sagittarius, November 24 to January 4, 2024. This will be the most important period of 2023 for you, and you are preparing for that moment now.</p>
<p>A you see, October will be cut in two like a loaf of bread—the first part is for fun and love, and the second part will focus you on work and for forming a professional strategy. In this sense, you will have an enjoyable work-life balance.</p>
<p>Sagittarius loves health and fitness, so save time in October to work out. The work projects will come in steadily, and you’ll need all your energy to keep up with them. As a Sagittarian, you embody all the fine ideals of the Greek philosophers—fine body, fine mind, fine spirit—and that’s why as a Sagittarian, you are known to be so strong and athletic, able to handle any level of work that life throws your way.</p>
