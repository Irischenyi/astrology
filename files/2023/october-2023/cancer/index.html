        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p><strong>Your October forecast is shorter than usual due to a severe eye infection I got earlier in September. Please be sure to read News From Susan Miller for a full explanation.</strong></p>
<p>The full moon that arrived at the very end of last month on September 29 at 6 degrees Aries likely marked an important point for your standing and reputation in your career. You may be reaching new heights, and with Venus positioned in Leo, moving direct and sending golden beams to the full moon in your lofty tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement at the top of your chart, your favor with VIPs is at an all-time high. This full moon will still affect you in the first four days of October, and it is sure to be exciting.</p>
<p>Any criticism you receive is apt to come from family who may feel temporarily neglected. Family members need not be concerned that you’ve forgotten about them—to a Cancer, family is always a first priority. This month you still have Mars in the sector of home and family, focusing your attention there until October 11 (a holdover from August 27). On the heels of Mars’ exit from this house, you have the most important aspect, a new moon solar eclipse in Libra, 21 degrees, on October 14. This suggests you can expect changes in your physical residence (or other property you may own, rent, or want to buy or sell) or in regard to news about a family member.</p>




        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>A new moon heralds a chance for a fresh start, so in regard to your home life, a new chapter is quickly about to form. You may be moving or renovating, closing on a house, or selling your childhood home. If you are getting divorced, your spouse may be moving out (but not without a negotiation), or it may be that your trusted roommate suddenly announces she or he has a new place to live. Alternatively, you may decide to move in with your significant other. If your landlord sold the building, you will be moving out, and that won’t be news you’ll want to hear—unless the landlord offers a generous amount of money to help you accomplish your move.</p>
<p>As the month nears an end, you will have a full moon lunar eclipse in Taurus, your friendship sector, on October 28 at 5 degrees. This eclipse will turn your attention to a female friend who is close to you. The moon is your ruler, and with good-fortune Jupiter conjunct this eclipse, a friend may make a generous gesture that will warm your heart. Venus will play the lead here, and Uranus, the planet of surprise will send Venus a glittering beam. You may travel with a friend, or October 28 may be when you soon return home, happy you took this particular trip together.</p>

        <h2>Your October Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>Eclipses bring closure, though, and sometimes a lunation like this will “eclipse out” a person from your day-to-day life. Your friend may marry, for example, and you may even be in the wedding, but soon she will move to a distant city, and you will no longer see each other frequently. You will promise to stay close, but you know that the relationship from now on will be changed. In this case, your experience may be bittersweet.</p>
<p>There are ways you can remain in touch, and with Saturn sending blessings to the full moon and also to the Sun, you may beat the odds and enjoy your friendship forever. It all depends on how determined you will be to keep the connection and the strength of the bond you have already formed. See how you feel. Keep in mind that this may not be the way the October 28 eclipse will work out. You may simply travel or create another plan together and enjoy it to the fullest.</p>
