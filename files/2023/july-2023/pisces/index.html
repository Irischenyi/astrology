        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>July will be a surprisingly gentle, happy month, one when you can relax, have fun, and see friends. It opens with a sweet-as-sugar full moon. It is so special that you’ve not seen anything quite like this in a long time.</p>
<p>The full moon will arrive July 3 in your compatible earth sign of Capricorn at 11 degrees. This full moon will be one of the most tender and joyous of the year, for it will light your eleventh house of friendships and likely coax you so you will enjoy the company of those you hold dear—and you may be invited to a special festive event. If you are, it would be quite luxurious. This full moon will be influential as it retains fullness and then wanes until July 6.</p>
<p>If you are not invited to an event, then do something you would love to do. Go to your favorite spa, ask a friend to come with you to the ballet or a Broadway show, see a museum exhibit, or go to a movie—in a real theatre, not streaming one at home. Have dinner in a beautiful restaurant with a friend or sweetheart, and enjoy a night out.</p>
<p>Jupiter is in your short-distance travel house, so you might be thinking of taking a quick weekend jaunt to the shore or a lake, and since May 20, the date Mars entered Leo, you’ve had a lot to do but you’ve also accomplished a lot. Mars is about to leave Leo, so the workload should lift a little bit while Mars tours Virgo from July 10 to August 27.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>Your eleventh house, Capricorn, where this full moon is appearing on July 3, rules more than your friendships and acquaintances. It rules the groups to which you belong, including charity and humanitarian organizations that you may be drawn to in order to help those less fortunate. If you do belong to a charity or club, you may be putting on an enchanting evening event as a fundraiser in July’s first week.</p>
<p>Above and beyond the friends and groups covered by the eleventh house is also something else. This house is one that the Greeks in the Hellenistic period called the house of joy and happiness, and this eleventh house also covers your dearest hopes and wishes. If you do not have a special event to look forward to, one where many people will be present, then you may see the realization of a long-term desire, and it may be one that you almost gave up seeing materialized. Saturn will reach out to the full moon July 3, and also to Jupiter, which is rare. It is quite a stellar set of circumstances. This tells me that the moves you are making in early July have gravitas and long-range benefit.</p>
<p>As said, Jupiter will reach out directly to this full moon, which is why this moon is so special. Jupiter is not only the planet of good fortune but also the planet of miracles. There is more significance of this to you, dear Pisces. In ancient days, Jupiter was the planet assigned to Pisces as your ruler, before the discovery of Neptune in September 1846, and the astrological community deemed Neptune your second, present-day ruler.</p>
<blockquote><p>The July 17 new moon is in a perfect position to help you find new love, if you are single, or fan the fires of love if attached.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>Modern astrologers look to both planets, Neptune and Jupiter, to discern your outlook and possibilities. Jupiter holds special significance to you and is given more weight in your chart than most others. Have faith that this full moon may bring something quite memorable. I love that Jupiter is so tightly beaming this full moon.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to the new moon on July 17, which could be magically romantic and touching. It will arrive in Cancer, 25 degrees. This new moon will appear in your fifth house of true love, and it is the only new moon of the year to fall in this part of your chart. A new moon brings on new beginnings, and this one is in a perfect position to help you find new love, if you are single, or fan the fires of love if you have a long-time sweetheart or spouse.</p>
<p>I love that Uranus will be in an ideal spot to support this new moon, and best of all, I feel a lovely surprise is due. You may get an unexpected invite to go to a nearby town for the weekend. Uranus is known to bring unexpected news, and because Uranus is beautifully supportive to the Sun and new moon, the news should be welcome—even exciting. Uranus is based in your third house of short, quick travel, the reason I think you will get an offer you will feel is too tempting to refuse.</p>
<p>This same part of your chart also rules communication conveyed through mail, email, text, or phone. Keep your devises near and powered up because you won’t want to miss this message.</p>
<p>You may alternatively get a writing or speaking assignment that would be quite wonderful. You appear to be growing in your sophistication in communications, especially with the written and spoken word, although it also could be in the form of coding and digital work. You seem very interested in new technology and may be putting your energies there.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>Whatever you are learning now will put you head and shoulders above others throughout this year and during the first half of 2024.This growing talent of yours to communicate clearly and with originality could pay off, so keep developing your skill.</p>
<p>As said earlier, Neptune, one of your two your ruling planets, will be in superb angle to the new moon July 17 and will spark originality, inspiration, and imagination that you can apply to your work.</p>
<p>Literary work seems to interest you too, and if so, pour your thoughts into a book you may be writing, a collection of poems or short stores, a screenplay, a digital game, or even a speech you will give. You may alternatively center on songwriting or direct your artistry into your performance if you are an actor, musician, or dancer or work in any of the other arts. With Neptune so supportive, you can make great strides in such areas as costume design, cinematography, photography, stage lighting, movie makeup, or other forms. This is where so many of Pisces’ gifts are centered.</p>
<p>Pluto will challenge the Sun and new moon, so you may have a friend, client, or collaborator who is critical of you, but don’t let this person’s views lower your self-esteem. Of course, if a client or boss is not happy with the work you have handed in on a particular project, you will need to find ways to collaborate with him or her to make the work more pleasing to them.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>Alternatively, it may be that the difficult person in your life will pick at the estimate you drew up and feel it is too high, completely underestimating all the work you will have to do to make the project successful. In that case, you need to gently show that person what’s involved, and you may need to hand in a more detailed, line-by-line estimate to help your client understand the work that will be needed. This is a new moon, so you would be starting soon, but you will need to proceed slowly.</p>
<p>Mars will oppose Saturn on July 20, so Mars in Virgo will coax you to want to start collaborating quickly, but Saturn will force you to slow down and urge you to look at all the elements involved. That’s a good idea because we are moving into two important retrograde periods, and that means everything will be going at a slower pace.</p>
<p>First, Venus will be retrograde from July 22 until September 3. Venus rules beauty, elegance, refinement, luxury, and money as well as the more tender side of life, including love, romance, affection, and warmth. You probably don’t have a lot of experience with Venus retrograde because this planet retrogrades rarely, only every 18 months for about six weeks. Venus rules all things pertaining to women, so if you are marketing a product or service that would be interesting to women, do not launch it until after September 15. (I have a reason to say after September 15, so stay with me, and you will see why a little later.)</p>
<p>Whether you are a man or a woman, don’t go see your dermatologist after July 22 to get Botox, fillers, a face lift, any beauty procedures, or cosmetic dental work. I would also like you not to get too close to July 22—leave a space of days. Also, do not change hairstylists or ask for a radical change in color or cut. Stick to the status quo. It’s not the time to buy things covered by Venus—things that embellish—such as diamonds, emeralds, or sapphires, for example.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>As I stated above, you have a romantic new moon July 17 in your house of true love, but the problem is Venus is going retrograde soon thereafter, and I would like you not to have a first date between July 22 and September 3. That first romantic date is the birth of the relationship, and I don’t want a weak Venus to be part of the inception of the relationship. The new moon of July 17 will be influential for months, so don’t worry—you will have plenty of other chances to meet someone special.</p>
<p>If you are seriously dating, attached, or married, Venus retrograde will not affect you too much. You likely met some time ago and have proven your love for each other.</p>
<p>Mercury will retrograde too, next month from August 23 to September 15. For all practical purposes, life won’t start to percolate again until mid-September.</p>
<p>If you would like to know more about Mercury retrograde, I have an essay you can read that outlines it in detail. Just Google “Everything You Need To Know About Mercury Retrograde.” This essay is also on the premium version of my award-winning app, “AstrologyZone Horoscopes Susan Miller” (subscribe for $4.99 a month at the Apple App Store and Google Play).</p>
<p>You have a very quiet, gentle full moon on August 1 in Aquarius, 9 degrees, which you will begin to feel grow in strength as early as July 29. This full moon will fall in your sector of privacy and rest, so take time for creative projects.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>You might want to withdraw a little from social life and simply take time to think and plan your course for the rest of the year. It may help to know that the very end of 2023 will be spectacular for your career, starting November 24 through January 4. As a Pisces, you love to socialize with friends, but you also need regular time alone to reflect on recent life events.</p>
<p>There is some indication at the very end of July you might consider traveling a short distance to visit a client, but that would not be wise, as Uranus, which is taking the lead at the August 1 full moon, will be in hard angle to Venus, and at the same time, Venus will be retrograde. (I had mentioned earlier that Venus has a connection to money and profits.) Venus will be base based in your sixth house of work-a-day assignments, the reason I am thinking you may want to go, but rather, I advise you to see your client in the second half of September. If you need to confer, by all means set up a call or Zoom conference.</p>
<p>At this full moon period, which will span until August 6, give yourself quiet time to unplug and exhale.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You have been working hard and taking on many responsibilities due to Saturn’s recent entry into Pisces. The universe feels July is your time to let go and have fun. It looks as though you will have a fabulous social event on your calendar to look forward to on or close to July 3. It will be an event that will draw you into a circle of many smiling faces. (Allow an area of influence of the full moon to include July 1-8.) It you do get an invitation, it seems certain that you will be rubbing shoulders with highly successful people socially or professionally. This full moon in Capricorn blends beautifully with your Pisces Sun, and because Jupiter will be prominent, you are sure to enjoy it and feel it to be time well spent.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>If you do not get an invitation, it is time to treat yourself. Book a luxurious time at a spa, or invite a friend to have a special dinner with you where you both can catch up in an elegant restaurant you’ve been longing to try.</p>
<p>Mars in Leo has put pressure on you to complete projects on a continual flow of tasks, a trend that started as far back as May 20, but that will finally dissipate on July 10. If you are attached, from July 10 on, you will have more time for your partner, who may have felt a little neglected while you attended to your tasks and overall heavy workload.</p>
<p>The new moon on July 17 will be precisely your cup of tea. It will fall in the wildly compatible sign of Cancer, a water sign like yours, and light your fifth house of true love, fun, children, and creativity. From this point on, you will have more time for romance, your children, and experimenting in your creative projects. (It is a rare Pisces that doesn’t have several creative projects going on at the same time.)</p>
<p>Are there any little clouds in the bright blue sky? Well, yes, in that Venus, the planet ruling fun and love, is about to go retrograde from July 22 to September 3. During that time, she will shut off her stream of sparkling light to you (and to the rest of us, too). Venus retrogrades rarely, only every 18 months for about six weeks. We get used to getting a cornucopia of goodies from this graceful planet, and it is easy to take her support for granted. Alas, we soon realize we do need Venus to add her special touches give life beauty, grace, and joy.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Pisces</h2>
        <p>If single and unattached, Venus retrograde is not considered a good time to find a new romantic partner—love and affection, which may seem so passionate at the start, may cool off quickly. Circulate instead at the gorgeous full moon of July 3 because you won’t want to build into the birth of a new relationship a weak Venus in retrograde from July 22 to September 3. It is not a time to give a lavish party or charity benefit or to buy expensive jewels. (Venus rules precious gems and all jewelry—she covers all that embellishes.)</p>
<p>Also, since Venus rules appearance, do not schedule an appointment for plastic surgery, Botox, or fillers. Do so early in July, in the first half, or after the beautiful new moon September 14. I even suggest you wait until after September 15 when Mercury will go direct, and leave a space of several days. These are some examples of what not to do while Venus languishes in retrograde, but you can follow along with regular activities, and of course, have hair trims and grooming (just not dramatic changes to your look).</p>
<p>By the full moon in Aquarius, August 1, you will be in a quiet mood, craving privacy and being content to spend time with those who mean the most to you. You will feel this full moon in the very last days of July as that moon builds toward fullness August 1.</p>
