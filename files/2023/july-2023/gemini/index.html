        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>July will strongly accent your finances, and this could be excellent news. You have been experiencing much higher than usual expenses, and every time you thought you had finally reached the end of them and fully mastered your money, new costs would pop up. July will be a great month to see more cash and end the frustrating spiral you’ve experienced.</p>
<p>Happy financial news will likely reach you within five days of the full moon on July 3 in Capricorn at 11 degrees. This full moon will light your eighth house of other people’s money, so you may hear that cash is on the way. You might find out you are receiving venture capital or that the insurance claim you sent in is being approved at a higher-than-expected payout. You may be told your financial aid application for college tuition will be granted or that your request for a bank loan or mortgage is approved.</p>
<p>If you work in sales or on a bonus, commission, royalty, or residual basis, a large check could come in. There are other possibilities, too. If you are owed back child support, you may be happy to see your former partner pay you. In fact, if anyone owes you, the money is likely to materialize within five days of July 3—by no later than July 8.</p>
<p>I am excited to see that Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, will shine a decisive beam toward the full moon on July 3 in the most harmonious way possible (a trine). Jupiter will simultaneously be in fine aspect to the mighty Sun and your ruler Mercury (in a sextile), and I am especially enthusiastic to see that Mercury is part of this group of planets because Mercury is your ruler, and your ruler is always weighed more heavily for you than most other signs—Mercury is the planet that has the job of taking great care of you. This translates into an opportunity that will soon emerge for you to likely see a large sum with your name on. You’ve worked toward this—it is probably not a gift—and you appear to deserve it.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>This July 3 full moon is appearing in your solar eighth house, which for Gemini is ruled by Saturn, and Saturn is currently based in your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement. Now get this. Saturn will be at an ideal angle to the Sun and Mercury in Cancer, your solar second house of earned income, and to the full moon in Capricorn, your eighth house. This suggests you may have been investing in your own business or in your career, and this might be where many of those expenses have been directed and why things are starting to pay off now. If you are up for a salary increase, it looks like it will be approved at this time.</p>
<p>Wait—there is more fabulous news. Jupiter, the Santa Claus planet, will be in an exceedingly rare, friendly aspect to Saturn. This is amazing. I believe you will see that in times when output is strong, the universe often makes a correction and helps you make up for the money that had to flow out. Saturn is the planet of stability and long-term gain, so your stability will come from the work you have been doing for your career—things are about to even out.</p>
<p>At the same time as this full moon on July 3, Uranus, the planet of unexpected developments, will still be in a tight, hard angle to Mars (90 degrees), which is in your solar third house of contracts. In your chart, Uranus rules legal matters (Uranus rules your solar ninth house), so this makes me wonder if you might have been having difficulties over a contractual matter. If so, you are likely being represented by a lawyer (a wise move), so that might be where some of your expenses have been going.</p>
<blockquote><p>By the end of the month, after so much attention on your finances, you may welcome the chance to fly to a distant location to exhale.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>Mars and Uranus are moving away from their feisty conflict with each other, which is helpful, but in early July they are still close enough to cause some problems. You will be out of the woods by July 16, possibly as soon as July 10. The person you are dealing with has been unpredictable and may have a hidden agenda that has perplexed you and made it hard to understand this person’s motivation and end game. The point is, these two planets are parting, and things will soon feel better. You may be able to finally end this adversarial contractual negotiation at long last.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the new moon on July 17 in Cancer, 25 degrees, which will also emphasize money because this new moon will appear in your solar second house of earned income. While a full moon (like the one on July 3) brings an ending or final answer, the new moon due July 17 will open a door. Think of a new moon as an opportunity to act—in this case, to ask for a raise, or if you have your own business, to increase sales. You may also receive an agreement or a contract that promises you money after you have completed duties on a new project.</p>
<p>This time the picture is quite different. Uranus, the planet of surprise, is on his best behavior and will send a shimmering silvery beam to the Sun and new moon in Cancer. The area to be lit up is your second house of earned income, so you may be pleasantly surprised by the money that you will soon be earning. I say surprised because Uranus brings sudden events—you won’t see this coming.</p>
<p>Also, the Sun and new moon will be in perfect angle to Neptune in your tenth house of fame and honors, so your status in the industry may benefit from work you do in entertainment or the arts or from an artistic or creative project. Additionally, if you are thinking of redesigning your website or upgrading the look of an app you’ve developed and now sell, or if you work on any other visual or musical project, it will go well, and could, in time, add up to a tidy profit for you.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>Pluto will tightly oppose the Sun and new moon on July 17, so you may have a very stubborn, difficult client who you may be negotiating with about pricing or money you owe. Pluto could also represent the government’s request for past taxes or a creditor looking for a student loan payment or other payment you promised. I see you may have something arise, but I am gratified to see other funds coming in at the same time, so I think you will be OK—you have enough positive aspects to counter this lone cranky one.</p>
<p>If you have your own business, the new moon on July 17 and the weeks to follow will be the most important point of the year to generate more income in the months ahead. You might want to schedule an advertising, publicity, or social media campaign for your goods or services.</p>
<p>Mars is about to move into a new sign, Virgo, on July 10, to stay until August 27, and will place a big spotlight on your present home or other property you might hope to rent, buy, or sell soon. You might be planning to move, renovate, do extensive repairs, refresh the décor, or clean and declutter, or have a landscape artist work on your property. Alternatively, you could be looking for a new roommate, or you might be ready to invite the painters in to add a fresh coat of paint to several rooms. If none of these areas are on your list, you may instead want to help a family member financially. This could be a parent who needs assistance or someone in your immediate family, such as a grown son or daughter, who may be going through a difficult patch.</p>
<p>It seems you will be anxious to get started on your home or family-related plan, but Mars will oppose Saturn on July 20, so your career duties will keep pulling you back and temporarily forcing you to wait while you keep your eye on all the moving parts in your assignments. You may need to do more research on what you have on your desk at work or give your full attention to new assignments before you switch your attention to your home. “Not now” does not mean “not ever.” The planets are sending mixed messages, so there are conditions to sort out first.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>It all comes down to looking at your priorities and deciding on how you rank each one. You may have to shuffle your list of goals—having clarity on what is important will be vital. From where I sit, it appears your career will be your primary aim, or it is currently bringing you enormous opportunity through Saturn’s position in your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement. This possibility will only be yours if you are willing to give it all you’ve got.</p>
<p>Saturn offers nothing easily—you have to work unusually hard to learn the ropes in a new area and not be distracted by outside events. You will have a more experienced person to help you master your new role, so you won’t be alone. This teacher will be critical, and you might at times wonder if this person truly cares about you and your progress, but yes, this person does care. If he seems like a drill sergeant, that’s his job and his style. You only get Saturn in this part of your chart every 29 years for a nearly three-year period. (This trend started when Saturn entered your prestigious career sector in March this year).</p>
<p>Think of this experienced person watching over your performance as a high-priced coach, committed to making you a success. Realize your course won’t be exactly easy because Saturn teaches us that the accomplishments we are most proud of in life are the ones we worked the hardest to achieve.</p>
<p>Are you up to the challenge? If you want the final prize badly and you commit to the learning period, you will be sitting on top of the world by the time this trend comes to an end in February 2026. You will have proved your mettle and earned your seat at the table. There are no predestined results in astrology—this is up to you.</p>
<p>As you get deeper into July, you will begin to feel the approaching full moon of August 1 in Aquarius at 9 degrees as it grows to fullness. After so much attention on your finances, you may welcome the chance to fly to a distant location to exhale and reflect on all you will have accomplished in July. Your ninth house, Aquarius, is very connected to travel, one of Gemini’s favorite activities.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>Alternatively, if you can’t travel during the full moon on August 1 (extending its influence until August 6), you may be finishing up a writing or speaking assignment or working with a digital product or one dealing with artificial intelligence. This full moon might express its message in a different way if you’re attending to and finishing up an immigration matter or one related to a passport, residency, or visa. Full moons bring a conclusion, and this one will be lighting up your ninth house, which also rules legal actions and the court system, so you may receive an answer to a legal matter. The topic of higher education (college or graduate school) may instead be on your mind, and you might be making a decision about that goal, such as changing your major, as one example, or even switching institutions of learning. It’s also possible that by August 1 you will finish up all the credits you need to graduate.</p>
<p>Before I go, I want to remind you that Venus will go retrograde this month from July 22 until September 3. For that reason, ideally, I would like you to finish up as many important actions you can prior to July 22, leaving a few days’ space before July 22. Venus rules love, beauty, luxury, and profits, and when Venus is out of phase, all these areas suffer.</p>
<p>I wrote a great deal about what to do (and not do) when Venus is retrograde (July 22 to September 3) last month in your June forecast. You can always access the previous month’s forecast on my website, Astrology Zone, and also on my easy-to-navigate app, Astrology Zone Horoscopes (available on Apple and Google Play). We do not archive more than one previous month, so if you want to look up June’s forecast after you’ve read the one for July, you may want to read it before it disappears at the start of August.</p>
<p>Briefly, Venus’ tie to beauty means this retrograde is not a good time to have cosmetic surgery or dental work, so no Botox or fillers, and it is also better to avoid a radical change in your hair color or cut. (Trims are fine to do.) If you are marketing a product or service that would be interesting to women, hold off during Venus retrograde.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>If you are single, do not look for a new romantic partner—Venus rules affection, and during retrograde, feelings may start out warm but soon cool off. You should not build Venus retrograde into the first meeting and start of your alliance (the birth of your relationship), because sooner or later in the course of your partnership, a weak Venus will likely leave you wondering why emotional warmth became an element that’s largely missing. If you’ve been dating someone seriously for a long time or you’re married, you will not have to be concerned with Venus retrograde harming your relationship, as it was started long ago.</p>
<p>All Gemini should enjoy simple pleasures with their partner during Venus retrograde. It is not a time to give a lavish party or to buy expensive gems because Venus governs all things that embellish and beautify. Any of these activities are fine during the first half of July but not near or after July 22.</p>
<p>I should let you know that your ruler Mercury will retrograde too, starting next month from August 23 to September 15, overlapping part of the Venus retrograde period. We are due to have a slow summer because two of the three planets we feel most strongly when retrograde (Mercury, Mars, and Venus because they orbit closest to earth) are to do so. (Mars will not retrograde until the end of next year on December 6, 2024, until February 23, 2025, so we are free and clear of Mars retrograde for a long time.)</p>
<p>If you need a computer, smartphone, air-conditioner, or even a car—or any other product that has electronic components—you will need to get it now in early July and no later than August 10 or so.</p>
<p>A slow, leisurely period in late July and August might suit you fine. You’ve been working hard, and these retrogrades will give you a chance to pull back to get a chance to simply think about what you’d like to do when life starts to get busy again after September 15. That period will be fueled by a gorgeous new moon on September 14, influential for weeks and months to come, and it will especially help you in the realm of home and family. You even have more money coming in during July!</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>Waiting for romance to start up in the later part of September will be extra good timing or you. The reason is Mars, the action planet, will enter your fifth house of true love, children, and creativity on August 27, staying until October 11, for the first time in two years. While you have to delete the first part of that period when both Venus and Mercury will be retrograde, your golden period for love will extend from September 15 (when Mercury goes direct) to October 11, the date Mars leaves Libra.</p>
<p>If you are not interested in finding new love, that mid-September period through the first week of October will be glorious for fun, relaxation, and a possible vacation or for focusing on having a child or playing with ones you have. Your creativity will shine during this period, too. You have plenty to look forward to, dear Gemini.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>The wild expenses you were experiencing in April and May might have started to settle down, thank goodness. This month you have an excellent chance to increase your income. Most Gemini will be determined to find new sources of money in July, and if that includes you, your timing will be perfect.</p>
<p>The full moon on July 3 may bring a large commission, royalty, or other check that will arrive outside of your salary to your delight. Saturn will rule the day and be in an ideal position in relation to the Sun and full moon—allow five days beyond this full moon to hear your answer or see results. The money you see might alternatively come as a tax refund, court settlement, child support, insurance payout, or the final installment of an inheritance that was in probate.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>Not only will Saturn be friendly to this full moon, but generous, good-fortune Jupiter will be lighting up the full moon, too. In a rare configuration, Saturn and Jupiter will beam to each other. Together, these two planets will work to bring you the right opportunities to allow you to build a comforting feeling of financial security. No matter how tough April and May might have been for your finances, it looks like July will offer financial relief through happy news.</p>
<p>More fantastic financial news is due at the new moon on July 17 and the days that follow—this news will be directly connected to your earned income. You may launch a new moneymaking project at this time, and if so, your expectations should be fulfilled.</p>
<p>This new moon on July 17 will be directly related to Neptune, indicating it is your creativity that will impress VIPs and be the reason an important door will open for you. Your thinking reflects a fertile imagination and willingness to challenge traditional patterns. Uranus, the planet of surprise, will be in an ideal place in deep space to send direct, shimmering vibrations to Pluto, so at month’s end, you may receive money from an unexpected source—if not at this time, then in several months.</p>
<p>While you have a lot of positive developments going on in your career, you will also have a strong emphasis on your family, residence, or other property when Mars moves to Virgo on July 10, staying until August 27. Mars will help you make plenty of progress, so keep working toward finding a perfect resolution or to create a sense of security for your parent or child who might need you these days.</p>
<p>After August 27, you have a glorious new moon on September 14, one of the best of the year, that will help you successfully fulfill your family and home-related projects. If you do your research and keep working toward your goal, you will clinch it—if not in July, August, or September (very possible), then certainly by March 2024.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Gemini</h2>
        <p>At the end of the month, starting near July 29, you will begin to feel the growing full moon in Aquarius, due August 1, which should be surprisingly positive for you. While Mars is about to enter your home sector, you might want to take a trip to visit a family member based afar, but Saturn in your career sector suggests you will need to attend to duties first and may even have to hold off on travel for now. You might put off travel because you could easily get a chance to work on a book, regular column, podcast series, or other communications project that excites you, and you may also work with a client in a foreign country. A new international endeavor holds great promise.</p>
<p>Also, by month’s end, Uranus will be in an ideal position to contact Pluto, so you may get a windfall of money as Uranus moves ever closer to an exact trine (a heavenly aspect). These are two very slow-moving planets, and they won’t make an exact aspect until July 2026, but by the end of this month, they will be in significant proximity and will give you a chance to showcase your talents and earn impressive money. You have only just begun—this trend will be strong for many months, and you will find a way to discover a market that fully appreciates your talents.</p>
<p>Venus will retrograde July 22 to September 3, so take things slow and easy, and when it comes to love and matters of attractiveness, stick to the status quo. Get as much done on key projects as possible in early July, or delay working on them until late September.</p>
<p>Mercury will go retrograde August 23 to September 15, so nothing earth shattering will occur until after September 15. Remember, however, that early July is sensational for receiving a large, one-time payment, and the days and weeks that follow the new moon in Cancer on July 17 will be excellent for finding new sources of steady income.</p>
