        <p>July starts out softly, like a small white kitten stepping silently over a furry white blanket. There will be few demands from others. You will be thankful for that because the past months have been a whirlwind of change with lots of adjustments to new conditions. You probably are surprised to see you are already half-way through 2023.</p>
<p>A particularly beautiful full moon will appear on July 3 in Capricorn at 11 degrees in your twelfth house, a private place in your chart. This area is known to perk up the subconscious and encourage creativity when you’re alone, working happily in solitude. The part that makes this full moon so special is the direct, glittering beam it will receive from Jupiter, the planet of good fortune and happiness. This wonderful aspect might find you working on an artistic project that you are passionate about and also sharpen your intuition to uncanny heights.</p>
<p>In early July, you may also spend quality time with your family, perhaps playing with children, and take time to catch up with your parents. This year, if you are fortunate enough to still have your parents near, they likely are supporting your ideas wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>Your mind will, of course, be on your career and the work you have yet to do, too. Your position there is steady and secure. Saturn, which is your ancient ruler, in Pisces will send a beautiful, comforting beam (trine) to the Sun in Cancer as well as to the full moon (sextile), which will appear in Capricorn. If you do not plan to work in the office during the first week of July, staying in touch with the office while at home, you will find that things are going exceedingly well, thanks to Saturn’s comforting vibe.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>If you need to move in July’s first week, you may get a tip on a remarkable space that is everything you’ve ever wanted—lots of space, large windows that afford you a view, and a house or apartment that supplies plenty of sunshine and large closets, and is situated in an ideal neighborhood, one close to work that would not require a long commute.</p>
<p>If you want to make any changes to your home, you can start thinking about doing so and collecting ideas to put in a folder. I would hold off making purchases, however, because we are moving into Venus retrograde very soon. As luck would have it, Venus rules Taurus, the sign permanently found on the cusp of your solar fourth house of home. That puts Venus in charge of your home (and is the reason Aquarians typically have such inviting, comfortable, and chic décor).</p>
<p>When I say to put off making home-related choices, I am referring to important design decisions. For those, it might be best to take your time. Do your research, but wait until late September to put those ideas into action. If you locate your dream house/apartment now, of course, you will need to snap it up quickly. It’s possible you would find it suddenly in the first nine days of July. You will get other chances, however, for as an Aquarian, you are the most favored of all signs for home and family matters now, and that comes thanks to the position Jupiter, which will remain in Taurus until May 25, 2024.</p>
<blockquote><p>Give your creative work all you have—you will be noticed, lauded, and possibly given awards for your foresight and ability.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>Venus will be retrograde from July 22 to September 3. Venus is concerned with comfort, beauty, luxury, art, entertainment, and fun, romance, and love. She is also involved with profits and money. When Venus is retrograde, she withholds her powers. This is why I would like you to refrain from making design choices during Venus’ out of phase period—you may not like the choices you make. Avoid giving a lavish party or fundraiser for a charity during Venus retrograde too, for the resulting donations are likely to be disappointingly low.</p>
<p>Also, avoid having plastic surgery, Botox, fillers, or dental cosmetic procedures during Venus retrograde, and leave a space of several days before the onset of the retrograde, July 22.</p>
<p>Venus is closely tied to products and service that will be marketed to women, so if you have a launch coming up that will be aimed mainly to women, delay the launch to the days that come after September 15.</p>
<p>The reason I say September 15 is that Mercury will retrograde too, from August 23 to September 15. This means that if you need a car, computer, smart phone, air conditioner, or any product that includes electronic chips, you need to buy that item in July or early August. Mercury rules all the moving parts and chips inside machines. As said, Mercury goes retrograde August 23 to September 15. Alternatively, you can wait until the second half of September.</p>
<p>If you need to sign an important contract or a lease, close on a house, or make any other kind of legal agreement—avoid Mercury retrograde if you can. If you would like to know more about Mercury when out of phase, Google “Everything You Need To Know About Mercury Retrograde,” which I wrote and is found on my website AstrologyZone.com: <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-mercury-retrograde/">https://www.astrologyzone.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-mercury-retrograde/</a></p>

        <p>I also have this article on the premium version of my award-winning app, “AstrologyZone Horoscopes Susan Miller” ($4.99 a month, available on Apple and Google Play). Find it under the Life and Love section, and once there, go to Susan’s Essays.</p>
<p>Now, returning to July, although July and August will have a slower pace due to these two planets’ approaching retrogrades, there are various points when you will see hints that activity is starting to stir up.</p>
<p>A case in point will be the important new moon on July 17 in Cancer, 25 degrees. This new moon will appear in your work-a-day daily assignment sector. It is very possible that an important new assignment will be green lit within days AFTER that new moon appears. You may need to map out all that the client needs, and may even need to hire staff to get the job done properly.</p>
<p>I love to see that your ruling planet Uranus will send a direct, dazzling silver beam to the new moon of July 17, suggesting that you will encounter at least one sweet surprise regarding the project at work. This is great! Your ruler Uranus will go out of his way to delight you. You will have an element of pure luck on your side and have every reason to be optimistic.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>There will be one tricky planet—Pluto—who will be standing 180 degrees away from the new moon on July 17. Pluto is a financial planet, so you may encounter some sort of conflict with a VIP at work—the topic will be the budget. It is possible, as I look at your solar chart, that I have this in reverse, and it might be you who needs to take a hard line about the budget when dealing with your team. It’s hard to say. Either way, you’ve got this.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mars will move into Virgo on July 10 to stay until August 27. During this time, Mars will move through your eighth house of other people’s money. It appears you will be spending more money than usual, and it seems to be directed to your home or to a family member (parent, sister, brother, daughter, or son) who you feel you need to help financially. Your financial outgo will be greatly alleviated by the time you get to August 27, the date Mars will move out of Virgo.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you may need a mortgage, bank loan, or line of credit for a personal goal, your own business, or other goals that require funding. You may be speaking with your broker, banker, accountant (perhaps to do tax planning), an estate planner, or if you have your own business, a venture capitalist to secure an infusion of cash.</p>
<p>It is possible that your focus on money will also include overseeing budgets and appropriation of money as part of your job at the office. If you do, this unusually strong focus will also be mitigated by August 27.</p>
<p>Mars in Virgo (July 10 to August 27) will make you enthusiastic and anxious to get started on plans, but on July 20, Saturn will be directly opposite Mars. Saturn will win this little tug-of-war with Mars because Saturn is the slower moving planet. Saturn will slow you down and ask you to double-check all your plans, assumptions, estimates, sources, and methods. You may feel this aspect from four days before July 20 to four days after. It won’t dampen your spirit though, just temporarily slow down progress.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>On July 30 to August 1, Mars will receive a gorgeous shimmering golden beam from Jupiter, an aspect I always love to see, for when these two planets are together, action (Mars) leads to profit (Jupiter). This is a very special couple of days to use for any business or financial deal.</p>
<p>By the time you get to the end of the July, you will get another big clue that the pace of life is again picking up to a new level and could start to move quite fast. (With Mercury retrograde, however, you won’t fully blast off until after September 15).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the full moon August 1 in Aquarius, 9 degrees, will bring something of enormous importance to a crest or culmination. Here is where the plot gets fascinating. I have to explain something complex, and it is very positive, sure to make you happy, so stay with me.</p>
<p>At the time of this full moon in Aquarius (August 1), you ruler Uranus will take center stage. By the very end of July, for the first time in decades, Pluto in Capricorn will reach out to Uranus in Taurus. Now these two heavy-hitters of the zodiacs will not make an exact trine (an aspect of supreme harmony) until July 18, 2026, and subsequently will make several contacts to each other until May 2028, each time a heavenly “trine,” which has not happened since 1921-1922.</p>
<p>To be clear, I am not speaking of a conjunction between Pluto and Uranus, which happened during 1965 to 1966 (and will not happen again until 2104). A conjunction sets off a brand-new cycle, but that is not happening now. In fact, we all are still being affected by that set of conjunctions from 1965-66.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>What’s interesting is Pluto will enter Aquarius on January 20, 2024, for a 20-year stay, and Uranus will move to Gemini starting in 2025. When Pluto and Uranus begin their perfect trines, they will be in air signs and in perfect position to help you. Uranus will be in you fifth house of creativity and love, and Pluto will be in your first house of personality. Pluto is the planet of power, money, and transformation, and Uranus, the planet of innovation, rebellion against tradition, and courageous experimental creativity. What a combination! You may be transformed by your innovative accomplishments, and you will be precisely in step with the new era of Pluto in Aquarius—the Age of Aquarius—which Pluto will usher in.</p>
<p>This is a major aspect that will affect all of society, and you will be in the center of all that happens. You will be making the headlines, and it begins as these two giant planets silently start to move this month into significant mathematical position in deep space millions of miles from earth. These two planets will pave the way for you to be the star of this powerful configuration. Give your creative work all you have—you will be noticed, lauded, and possibly given awards for your foresight and ability to create a new template for a completely new era.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>As your month begins, you’ve been through several difficult eclipses that required adjustments over the past months, so you will be happy to have some privacy and rest over the full moon in Capricorn on July 3. It will be influential as you enter the month, extending as far as July 6. If you feel you’ve had more than your share of stress lately, the first week of July would be a lovely time to take time off and take some time for yourself.</p>
<p>You may be thinking of moving, buying or selling property, or giving your present space a fresh look. If so (and it seems very likely), spend time browsing Internet sites and shops during July’s first week—you are apt to find something quite beautiful that captures your attention and imagination.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>From July 1 to July 9, Mars will be in your partnership house, and you may have to cajole your roommate, spouse, or live-in lover into understanding the wisdom of your home-related plans. Your partner seems unconvinced, so offer an appealing vision of the future to rally support. Your family, however, will be 100 percent behind you and will do all they can to help you see your home-related dreams come true.</p>
<p>If you are not making changes to your home, you may be helping a family member with their home or offering help to an immediate family member financially to get over a difficult patch.</p>
<p>New assignments at the office are about to proliferate in the days, weeks, and months that follow the new moon in Cancer on July 17. Until this point, life will have proceeded slowly, so it may surprise you how fast things will be ramping up.</p>
<p>Your favorite project will be the one that taps into your sense of style and creativity and allows you to display your unerring sense of the future horizon, of what is coming into play through rapid societal changes, which is such a hallmark of being an Aquarius, and you will be untraditional and forward thinking. It sometimes takes others a while to catch up with you—let them mull things over, and don’t ask for quick answers. We all have to get used to ideas as original as yours.</p>
<p>Pluto will oppose the new moon of July 17, so you may have to contend with a demanding client or VIP in your company who never seems fully satisfied. Even so, you will need to do your best to please this person, as this seems to be about money and budgets. You can get on the good side of this somewhat cranky person, but it will take a bit of effort.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>Overall, however, you will like having your services in demand in the workplace, especially since your expenses are due to edge higher this month from July 10 to August 27. If you say, no, you are not in demand, you lost your job, keep looking for a new one. This month you are likely to find a job similar to the one you had before. You will be confident you can do it with ease. If you have a job, you will be a vital part of the team, so offer up all your ideas, for they will have a good chance of being approved and lauded.</p>
<p>In matters of love and good looks, you need to know that Venus will go retrograde from July 22 to September 3. While Venus is out of phase and sleeps, you won’t have access to her generous gifts of love and affection, luxury, and beauty.</p>
<p>Venus is all about your face, so this period would not be the time to schedule plastic or cosmetic surgery (no Botox or fillers), nor would it be the time to have veneers put on your teeth. Don’t ask your stylist for a new hair style or color—you may not like it.</p>
<p>It’s also not the time for a large, expensive party or charity benefit, and in love, not a favorable time to meet a new romantic partner, for affection is likely to cool down much too soon.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Aquarius</h2>
        <p>Early July will be sensationally special and positive, so schedule as much as you can during the first two weeks of July or wait until after September 15. Remember to leave a space of days after the date any planet goes direct (in this case, Venus will turn direct on September 3 and Mercury will turn direct September 15).</p>
<p>The full moon on August 1 will fall in Aquarius, and you will feel the energy as it approaches. A goal or wish of great importance to you will be reaching a crest. This may involve a decision about a close, serious, committed relationship in love or business or a personal decision you are about to make about a subject dear to your heart.</p>
<p>This lovely full moon will be boosted by Uranus and Pluto, so the sky’s the limit for you now and for several years to come—there will be no stopping you!</p>
<p>On top of that, you have a glorious new moon on Thursday, September 14, and it will be one of my favorites of the year—this one will be a peach—so wait a few days after this new moon appears, and suddenly there will be no more waiting, as they say, “Wagon wheels will be turning, westward ho!” Success lies ahead.</p>
