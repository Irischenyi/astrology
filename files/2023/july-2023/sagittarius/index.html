        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>As you begin the month, a bright and friendly full moon on July 3 in Capricorn, 11 degrees, will urge you to pay bills and have a look at your overall finances. Just when you start to feel a little anxious that you really do need cash to cover all your expenses, you will likely receive a surprise from your office that you are needed to work on a big project, and it looks like you’ll be earning more money.</p>
<p>This is Jupiter, the planet of good fortune, speaking in your chart.</p>
<p>Jupiter is in your house of work-a-day assignments, and at the start of July, management will be extremely pleased with your performance and may even promote you to a more advanced role that will increase your salary.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Jupiter will signal the mighty Sun, suggesting you might get a new benefit from your company. For example, you may receive a better health insurance policy meant for executives, extra vacation days, or the opportunity to join a tuition matching program (where your employer pays half if you promise to stay with the firm for a certain length of time). These are a few examples, but I do see luck coming to you from your eighth house of other people’s money. In another instance, your company may ask you to travel a great deal and, in gratitude, allow you to spend several extra days in your favorite city abroad at the firm’s expense. The Sun rules your travel sector, so the latter example is very possible.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>The money you see from your eighth house does not have to be tied to your job. You may receive a check from an insurance company for a claim you sent or an inheritance that a long-lost relative left for you in their will. Or you might win a raffle prize or a court case. If you are dividing property in a divorce, things may come to a close in early July, and if they do, you will receive a very generous settlement. Alternatively, you may decide to go over your retirement portfolio with your broker and make any adjustments to ensure better performance.</p>
<p>There is also something else special going on in your chart at the same time as the full moon on July 3 that involves great news about money. During this full moon, Saturn in your home sector will be in contact with the Sun and Mercury in your eighth house of other people’s money. If you applied for a mortgage, second mortgage, or home improvement loan, you would likely get a call from your banker about whether your request has been granted, and the answer is likely to be a yes. If your home sustained heavy damage recently, you could now receive the settlement offer from your insurance company.</p>
<p>This full moon is in Capricorn, your money house, putting an extra spotlight on Saturn.</p>
<blockquote><p>At the new moon on July 17, more income is likely to flow to you—you seem to be a virtual money magnet this month.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>Saturn entered Pisces, your fourth house of home, last March, so something about your home may be a concern. If you were part of a disaster, having experienced an earthquake or flood that caused you to lose your house (a very traumatic event), you may get very good news from a government program to help you rebuild. I hope this did not happen to you, but if this did occur, comforting news could come in the early part of July. If you instead want to help a parent find an assisted living facility or nursing home, you can find answers in early July.</p>
<p>Looking ahead now to the new moon on July 17 in Cancer, 25 degrees—all these types of funds from other people’s money will come up and allow you to make greater progress. Again, more income is likely to flow to you—you seem to be a virtual money magnet this month. You need to be ready to fill out paperwork if necessary.</p>
<p>I love that Uranus, the planet of all things unexpected, will tightly signal this new moon to bring unexpected changes in your company that will add up to considerable money for you. If your company is sold, you could easily walk out with a generous severance package. If you work in sales, a large check could arrive in the form of a bonus or substantial commission. If you applied for a grant, venture capital, or a business loan, it is very possible it will come through sometime after July 17. The money you receive mid-month after this new moon appears to be related to your career and work.</p>
<p>No forecast for a Sagittarian (or if you have Sagittarius rising) would be complete without a discussion about your chance to take a trip to a location that would require your passport. I was so happy to see you WILL get a chance to pack your bags and go. You will have to be decisive and quick in early July, sometime between July 1 and July 9. That’s when Mars will make your travel absolutely splendid. Mars will be in Leo, a fire sign like yours, and will light your ninth house of foreign people and places.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>When Mars moves to Virgo on July 10, to stay until August 27, you will need to have your mind back on your work and focused on your excellent career. This period will be one of the most important in 2023 for you to make one or more stunning professional victories.</p>
<p>Then, when this period is over on August 27, you will have one of the best new moons of the year on September 14 in this same area of your chart, Virgo, your solar tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement. Mars will help you build your foundation for your coming success, to be achieved after the new moon on September 14 arrives—the time when you will see the fruits of your labors. A new moon is important for many weeks that follow it, but I admit that the first 10 days will bring you your strongest days.</p>
<p>I like the timing, and here is why. Venus will go retrograde from July 22 to September 3. While Venus takes her nap, she will not interfere with the important new moon in Virgo on September 14 because Venus will awaken earlier on September 3.</p>
<p>Mercury will go retrograde too, from August 23 to September 15. (September 14 falls on a Wednesday, so thankfully Mercury will go direct one day later on September 15—but it is always best to leave a space of days before taking action.)</p>
<p>When Venus is retrograde, you should not schedule plastic surgery on your face, and you should avoid having Botox, fillers, or dental cosmetic work, like putting in veneers. This is not the time to ask your stylist to create a radical new haircut or color. Men should also stick to the status quo, but it is OK to do simple grooming, like having trims. Don’t change stylists, if possible, and if you are interested in trying a new, expensive skin-care routine, do so when Venus is not retrograde. You can do all these things in the first two weeks of July, and if you cannot, wait until the second half of September to make your dramatic changes.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>Romance will be best for you during the first week of July when Venus and Mars will orbit closely together in Leo, preferably while you are traveling with your sweetheart. Single Sagittarians should not have a first date with someone during Venus retrograde (after July 22). Venus rules love and warm affection, but when Venus is retrograde, she withholds her greatest power. If you have a first date while Venus sleeps, you would be building Venus retrograde into the birth of the relationship, which would be unfortunate because Venus retrograde will follow your new relationship throughout its term. A relationship may start out warm and fun but soon fall flat.</p>
<p>Married Sagittarians and those in an established relationship will not be harmed by Venus retrograde because you likely started your alliance a long time ago when Venus was in direct orbit. (Venus goes retrograde rarely—every 18 months for approximately six weeks.)</p>
<p>You likely already know that during Mercury retrograde it is best not to sign a contract, nor is it an ideal time to begin a new venture. I have found it is not wise to buy airline tickets when Mercury is retrograde because I always wind up extending my trip and paying more for tickets. You can go on your trip during Mercury retrograde as long as you have clearly marked your luggage (and added Apple AirTags inside as an extra fail-safe).</p>
<p>I also always check my new app “Moonlight Phases” when choosing a flight. (The name is “Moonlight Phases, Susan Miller,” and it is sold on the Apple App Store and Google Play. I have GPS built into all my apps, so they are accurate for wherever in the world you happen to be.) I like to make sure the moon is not void of course when I am supposed to take off. I did forget to check my app once when flying home from Dallas to New York City this past February—the moon was void, and I was stuck in Dallas’ DFW Airport for six hours before the flights were worked out and we could board again—from another gate and a different terminal that was miles away. I realized then that I should have checked my app.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>As you get close to the last days of the month, you will begin to feel the pull of the August 1 full moon in Aquarius, 9 degrees, your third house of short-distance travel. You might be content to take weekend trips, but it seems you have business to complete either to see a client or to settle family property, as two examples. In short, it seems you would have a goal to accomplish, although that would not preclude a little fun, such as seeing friends in that city while you are there. This same full moon might bring up a contractual matter, and although you will need to negotiate certain points, you can come to an agreement. Mercury will not retrograde until August 23 to September 15, so you can proceed.</p>
<p>The tightest aspect at the full moon on August 1—always telling of how events will work out—brings Mars in Virgo in a perfect, sweet trine to Jupiter in Taurus, and Jupiter is currently based in your work-a-day assignments and tasks sector. I love this interplay between Mars and Jupiter—your actions will lead to profit. You will see activity and interest, so make it work for you.</p>
<p>There is more.</p>
<p>At the time of this full moon on August 1, three major planets will join hands and create rare harmony—Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, quite a troika of power. Each is a distant planet that spins on the outer rim of our solar system—Pluto will bring a large sum of money, Neptune adds creativity, and Uranus can deliver you a client who is suddenly interested in exactly what you have to offer.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You may be wondering when to travel because, as a Sagittarius, you are the international travel sign. The answer is to go during the first 10 days of July when you will be able to travel far and wide and experience breathtaking romance, too. These first days of the month will be some of the sweetest you’ve seen in a long time, so if you can take a trip, by all means, do it. Jupiter, your ruler, will be in fine angle to the Sun, indicating a joyous experience is coming up.</p>
<p>As you get deeper into July, and as the song by Randy Bachman goes, you’ll be “Taking care of business (every way).” You will have a full moon in Capricorn that will appear on July 3 (influential until July 8), and at this time, you’ll want to polish off any bills. This very favorable full moon—on July 3—is one of the best you’ve seen in months, so you may receive an unexpected check, possibly from family, or you might get a raise, and it certainly would pay off to ask for one in the beginning of July. There are many possible sources for your influx of money, but what matters is that the income arrives at just the right time when your expenses have been running higher than usual.</p>
<p>The new moon on July 17 could again bring surprising, excellent news about money that will come from a work-related opportunity. If you are hoping to switch to a different field, taking a part-time job may help you to learn the ropes in a new industry, and you will have additional income. While you are interested in satisfyingyour financial situation, you may look into apps that can help you to regularly put small amounts of money aside or lower your expenses. The new moon on July 17 would be the ideal time to start your personal financial program.</p>
<p>Uranus will be friendly to the new moon on July 17, so you may suddenly get a windfall to add to your now growing financial picture. While you are interested in creating a strong monetary base, you may want to consult your financial advisor to see how your retirement portfolio is doing and make tweaks if necessary.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>If you have not written a will, get that done too, because the house that is lit up on July 17 (opening financial opportunities for weeks beyond that date) will be your eighth house. This house covers commissions, bonuses, severance packages, bank loans, scholarships, court settlements, insurance payouts, inheritances, and other sources of income that come to you from outside your salary, like some of theexamples I just mentioned.</p>
<p>Not only will your income likely increase this month, your professional status in your industry will, too. After July 10, Mars will move to your career sector, giving you the best opportunities for professional advancement that you’ve seen in two years. Be ready to go after your dream job, dear Sagittarius. Mars will brighten this area of your chart from July 10 to August 27.</p>
<p>If you are single, it would be best to stop socializing while Venus goes retrograde from July 22 to September 3. Venus does not retrograde often (only every 18 months for approximately six weeks), but when Venus does go out of phase, you do not have access to her gifts of beauty, luxury, and affection. If you meet someone under this unfavorable trend, the warmth between you may cool off quickly, leaving you wondering what happened. This is also not the time to buy expensive jewelry or to host a lavish party.</p>
<p>If you are already attached, you may want to stick to simple outings. As for beauty, do not schedule Botox, fillers, a face lift, or a radical new hair style or color—stick to the tried and true from July 22 to September 3, and leave a space of days on both ends of this period. Knowing this, make the period prior to July 22 productive, especially the first two weeks of July.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>As you get close to the end of the month, you’ll be aware of the full moon that will appear on August 1, and this full moon will again urge you to travel, only this time to a destination much closer to home. Short overnight trips might be a lovely idea—they would keep you refreshed and motivated. Additionally, I feel these trips may be for business, to see a client or to settle family property.</p>
<p>Also, by the end of July, Pluto will move closer to Uranus for the first time in decades. Together, these two planets will set up a link between your work-a-day projects and your earnings sectors. This is a fantastic, rare aspect that will allow you to build clout in your industry, grow, and be a force to be reckoned with. This aspect will move slowly and reach its apex in July 2026, but by this month’s last week, you will start to see the door opening—it will be up to you to make the decision to walk through it.</p>
