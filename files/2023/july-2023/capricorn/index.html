        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>Many sweet little planets in your chart are coaxing you to give in to the private, warm, and loving side of life. You love to work hard and get ahead in your career, but you are about to enter a slowdown from later in July through mid-September when you will have lots to time to devote to a relationship or to a personal goal that is important to you.</p>
<p>Your best point of the month, which I will detail for you shortly, will come right at the beginning, thanks to the magnificent full moon in Capricorn on July 3. Get as much done in the first two weeks that you can, for that’s when you will have an open road, without obstacles, and have things click into place.</p>
<p>Later, Venus will retrograde—from July 22 to September 3, and that will slow down career progress because Venus rules Capricorn’s prestigious professional sector (tenth house) as well as your solar love sector (fifth house).</p>
<p>Additionally, Venus rules love, so singles should not have a first date during Venus retrograde, as the relationship may cool off quickly, if it even has a chance to take off.</p>
<p>Seriously dating couples and those who are married will not be as affected by Venus retrograde, since you have been together for some time and have proven your love for each other. Still, it would not be the best time to become engaged or married. You can always marry at City Hall secretly prior to Venus retrograde. If you do this, TELL NO ONE, and go on with your plans on the day you chose for your wedding. This way you would not build Venus retrograde into the birth of your new relationship or marriage, and just the two of you will know your secret. Always celebrate your festive wedding date as your anniversary.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>Avoid getting cometic surgery, Botox, or fillers from July 22 to September 3 too, and delay any other dramatic changes to your appearance, such as to have a radical haircut or color change. Delay having cosmetic dental procedures.</p>
<p>Venus rules products and services mainly interesting to women, so whether you are a male or female executive working on a launch to women, do not do it during Venus retrograde. Things will become complicated, however, because Mercury is also due to go retrograde, August 23 to September 15.</p>
<p>So you see, the first half of July will be your best time to make progress on just about any score. If you cannot get things in place during that period, do what you can to wait until after September 15 to begin again your most important relationships and ventures.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at July in detail, for you will have so much to enjoy (even with those retrogrades beginning later in the month. Remember, other people will be under Venus and Mercury retrograde too, so you will not lose your competitive edge by turning away from career matters for a little while—in fact, you will be working with the cycles of the universe, and that will put you in a better position than your competitors.)</p>
<blockquote><p>When Mars moves through compatible Virgo from July 10 until August 27, you will have plenty of choices for travel.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>The month starts out with a magnificent full moon on July 3 in Capricorn, 11 degrees, indicating something of enormous importance is about to reach culmination. It will make you exceedingly happy too, for this gorgeous full moon will receive a direct golden beam from Jupiter, the planet of good fortune and happiness. Wow, this is one of the best full moons of the year.</p>
<p>Jupiter is reaching out to this full moon from his base in your fifth house of true love. This is a place Jupiter entered on May 16 this year and will continue to remain until next year—May 25, 2024. This makes you one of the most favored of two signs to find genuine, lasting love this year. (When it comes to love, single Taurus also has a good chance of finding great love.)</p>
<p>This full moon of July 3 will likely bring a special relationship to fullness, so watch to see what happens. If you are single and not dating, you may meet someone new who you will want to know better. Attached and seriously dating Capricorns may become engaged at this vital and extraordinarily benefic new moon. For other Capricorns, it might be your wedding day. This full moon will be influential until its fullness passes, so you would feel it through July 6.</p>
<p>Your ruler is Saturn, and Saturn is the prominent planet at this full moon, and REMARKABLY, Saturn will be in supreme conversation with the Sun in your marriage/serious partnership sector (seventh house) as well as with the full moon in your house of identity, vitality, and personality (solar first house ). As you see, this full moon focuses on everything about you. Clearly what is going on at this full moon is critically important to you and your future.</p>
<p>There is alternative message of this full moon: You or your partner may discover that she/you is pregnant, or if at near term, the baby will be born on or within five days of July 3. Many babies are born at a full moon.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>Your artistic creativity is also covered by the fifth house where Jupiter is based, so you may be finishing up an imaginative project close to your heart. You’ll look forward to bringing your creation to the world, and it appears the time has come. (If not, you certainly have reached an important plateau toward that aim.)</p>
<p>The first week of July will be a sparkling, emotionally fulfilling time. Mars and Venus are traveling within four tiny degrees of each other. Both are found in a part of your chart known to rule physical affection, and the job of Venus and Mars is to spark affection and romance.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Sun will be in family-oriented Cancer, traveling in your partnership/commitment/marriage sector (seventh house). The Sun will be linked directly to Jupiter, planet of happiness and good luck—and Jupiter is traveling in fellow earth-sign Taurus, your fifth house of love, romance, fun with children, and creativity. I love this full moon of July 3, and it will spread its goodness like warm honey over the entire week.</p>
<p>Remarkably, as an additional bonus, both the Sun and Jupiter will be in friendly touch with your ruler Saturn in your communication/agreement/contractual sector (solar third house). It is hard to get major celestial bodies to work together, but here you have proof that they can—and they’re doing so in exquisite harmony. Divine happiness comes with the promise of longevity from your actions at this time of the full moon July 3 (plus five days).</p>
<p>This full moon will put the emphasis on you because it will be in Capricorn.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>Now we turn to the new moon on July 17 in Cancer, 25 degrees, where the emphasis will be on your partner. This will herald a fresh start and new beginning in the realm of a romantic or business partner. If you already have a romantic or business partner, you may enter into a new arena together, working on new goals that you can agree on and eventually see impressive progress. In your personal life, you may decide to save for a house or to welcome a new baby. In business, you may sign a new lawyer with a specialty you need, a new bookkeeper, social media director, or agent to represent you, as some examples. It can be any goal in business or in love that requires a commitment as a team.</p>
<p>In this sweetly emotional month, if you didn’t get engaged earlier in July, this new moon of July 17 may open up a discussion about whether to wed. Uranus will be quite active in a loving way, so you or your partner may simply pop the question or at least bring up the discussion without warning and surprise you. July 17 is the new moon, but it will be strong for weeks after it appears (but strongest within the first 10 days).</p>
<p>If you are not involved with a special someone in the romantic sense, you can still use this bright energy for forming an important business partnership. If a contract is being drawn up between business partners, it may be for a creative purpose because Uranus, the planet of innovation, is found in your fifth house of creative expression. Actually, though, the partnership may come into being for any reason and would be due to the always-thinking, non-traditional, experimental, Uranus.</p>
<p>There is one cautionary blinking yellow light, and it comes from Pluto in Capricorn. Pluto can be very forceful, so it seems you may be set on what you need to agree to before any business or personal contract can move forward. (This might represent a pre-nuptial contract that you drew up.) Pluto is in Capricorn, so that refers to you. Pluto is directly opposed to the new moon at 180 degrees (an aspect that sometimes points to a tug-of-war position), and the new moon is appearing in your partnership sector. You may need to compromise if the relationship is to be made official.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>If the partner you hope to sign is also a Capricorn, you will likely have a hard negotiation on your hands. Both of you will want to get your points in and not show a lot of willingness to give in to the other. Let’s stay positive and optimistic—there are always ways to find agreement if the two parties really want to enter into the relationship. This month offers plenty of beautiful aspects to help things along. Uranus’ presence suggests you will do best by thinking outside the box and even be untraditional, if necessary, to get the agreement moving forward.</p>
<p>On the romantic side of the coin, I have heard of a pre-nuptial agreement coming up suddenly and without warning an hour before the ceremony, as the guests are still arriving. This forces your bride or groom to sign quickly, or the ceremony won’t take place. This is not fair to the person you want to marry, so instead, bring up the need for a pre-nuptial agreement well in advance of the wedding.</p>
<p>On a completely different topic, you may be wondering when it would be best to take a vacation, and here you do have lots of options. When Mars moves through compatible Virgo from July 10 until August 27, you will have plenty of choices.</p>
<p>My very favorite point for you to go on holiday would be Tuesday, August 1, when Mars in Virgo and Jupiter in Taurus combine their energies in a heavenly trine—your vacation would be so much fun. Leave earlier on the preceding weekend, Saturday, July 29, or Sunday, July 30, when the moon will be in Capricorn, and embed that Tuesday, August 1, into the time you are away. Mars rules action, and Jupiter in his position in your divine house of true love will bubble up passion and excitement. It’s hard to imagine how you could go wrong. The trip would be glorious.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>If you cannot get time off during that period, July 10 to August 27, you have a gorgeous new moon in your ninth house of travel on September 14 that may work better for you if you are to make a distant trip.</p>
<p>I know that you have been spending more money than usual, ever since Mars went into Leo back on May 20, but you should see your high spending simmer down after Mars leaves on July 10. At that time, until August 27, Mars will be in Virgo, a sign that blends perfectly with yours. This has to be good news.</p>
<p>As you get close to the full moon of August 1 in Aquarius, 9 degrees (this full moon just happens to be the same day that will be so special for you to take a trip), it looks like you will need to pay bills. Within five days of that date. Perhaps you can do most from your smart phone. You may be tense to see money leaves your account, but if you do, I feel this would be the residue from the time Mars was in Leo—you are now finishing off that period and moving forward, and you are likely to find it easier to control your finances.</p>
<p>Two planets that will be slowly coming into focus in deep space should be very encouraging concerning your future financial picture. At the end of July, for the first time in decades, Pluto, currently in Capricorn, will be within mathematical significance of a heavenly trine to Uranus in Taurus, your fifth house of love, children, and creative expression.</p>
<p>Now these two planets will not reach apex—a perfect trine, a sublime aspect—until July 18, 2026, and will several times until the last perfect trine on May 10, 2028. But wait. Because these are two of the slowest moving outer planets, by the end of July they will be close enough to speak to one another and to hear one another’s messages. That means they will start to become close enough to help you!</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>The last time we had a sweet trine (120 degrees) between Pluto and Uranus was in 1921 and 1922. The last time we had a conjunction of these two planets it was from October 1965 to June 1966, and we are still being affected by that cycle. A conjunction is the strongest aspect between two planets because it marks the onset of a new cycle. We will not have a conjunction, but we will have something you probably will love better, a gorgeous trine, considered dazzling, especially when involving two power planets.</p>
<p>This collaboration between Pluto and Uranus could help you make quite a bit of money through an artistic creation or scientific invention in coming years. It gives you something to think about!</p>
<p>During the coming years, Pluto will move into Aquarius next year, 2024, for a 20-year stay, and Uranus will move into Gemini in July 2025 for a seven-year stay. This is further evidence that if you market your idea correctly and with focus and energy (as Capricorn is always known to do), there is money to be made that could transform your life and give you the kind of choices you never dreamed you would have. You would have to work hard to be part of the outcome, but that’s your trademark, dear Capricorn.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You are known to be the most professionally ambitious sign of the zodiac, but in July, turn away from career matters, and take some moments to enjoy life. You won’t lose career momentum, so you have nothing to lose.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>The full moon of July 3 will be a peach, and it falls in Capricorn. It is one of your important moments of the year when something dearly important to you will come to culmination. Jupiter, the planet of good fortune, will send blessing to both the full moon and Sun, suggesting the full moon may bring an exciting meeting to a new romantic partner, an engagement, your wedding, a wanted pregnancy, or birth of a baby.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may see the conclusion of your work for a well-done creative project and be excited to hear the sound of applause. Jupiter will reach out to the Sun, so it appears you will receive money—or one or more beautiful gifts—at this time.</p>
<p>This month emphasis joining forces with another person in love or business. If you have no romantic partner (and don’t want to meet one just now), you may be ready to sign a business partner, agent, publicist, new lawyer, accountant, or other professional. The new moon on July 17 would be a fine time to do so, for the association is likely to be profitable.</p>
<p>Now on July 17, Pluto will oppose the new moon, so if negotiating, be willing to compromise to get the agreement done. As the Rolling Stone song goes, “You can’t always get what you want…,” and that’s true. Things move forward when we listen to the other side and find creative ways to craft a deal for a win-win for both sides.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>Finding ways to dance with a partner in an effective way can sometimes be tricky, especially if one partner feels the other holds more financial control in the relationship, so at the new moon July 17 in your opposite sign of Cancer, you may decide to find a way to make the partnership more evenhanded and harmonious.</p>
<p>Neptune, the planet of inspiration, will be in remarkably fine condition toward the Sun and new moon July 17, so use a soft touch and creatively seek to better understand what truly motivates your partner. If you are working on a creative project with a partner, such as screenwriters regularly work with a writing partner in Hollywood (as one example), you will find this new moon to bring a boost to your efforts and help you find the right person to collaborate with.</p>
<p>As you get to the last week of July, Pluto will come within a friendly range of Uranus, the planet of independence and rebellion. Pluto, having been in Capricorn since 2008, is a powerhouse planet and has helped you build confidence in your abilities. Uranus is currently moving through in your fifth house of true love.</p>
<p>These two planets are extremely powerful and will reach a peak aspect in July 2026 and continue to make aspects through May 2028.</p>
<p>They move so slowly on the outer rim of our solar system that by month’s end, these two planets will have already moved into range of mathematical significance to each other and will start communicating with each other—and to you.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Capricorn</h2>
        <p>It is known that Pluto is the planet of transformation and that Uranus rules all that is unusual, non-traditional, innovative, non-apologetic, and independent in spirit. You may be transformed by love or by an artistic expression or scientific invention you come up with that can make you a great deal of money in time.</p>
<p>As Pluto and Uranus keep moving—gradually into air signs as they keep communicating—they will be in a great position to help you make a lot of money.</p>
<p>Do you need to take a break and enjoy a trip out of town? You will feel like traveling once Mars moves into Virgo—a great spot for you, as Virgo is a fellow earth sign—and this time you may decide to go overseas. Mars will be in Virgo from July 10 to August 27. Take your pick! Also, in case you cannot get away in those months, the new moon of September 14 and the 10 days that follow will be incredibly beautiful and just perfect for an exciting trip abroad.</p>
<p>Your best pick to travel this month? Leave over the weekend of July 29-30, and be sure to include Tuesday August 1 as part of your time on your glorious trip. Mars will be in sync with Jupiter, so this would not only be a fun trip but a romantic one, too.</p>
