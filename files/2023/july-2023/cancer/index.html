        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>Lucky you, you have a happy month ahead. The past few months have been surprisingly difficult, but July will be a gleaming exception on so many fronts. I feel you will start to see the tide turn to your favor at the moment the month begins.</p>
<p>On July 3 you have a full moon in Capricorn, 11 degrees, to light your partnership sector (seventh house). You are about to see a happy culmination to your relationship with one person in particular, and it could be someone you’ve been dating a long time and truly love. Or if you are married, this glorious full moon might bring good news from your spouse, either in his or her life (that will affect you, too) or concerning a special surprise your spouse will plan for you that will warm your heart.</p>
<p>Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, will send beautiful, sparkly beams to the full moon, and although the full moon is on July 3, you will start to see the warmth of these lucky aspects as soon as July 1 and as late as July 7. If you are neither married nor dating seriously, then the person who will figure prominently in your life could alternately be a business partner or collaborator.</p>
<p>Jupiter is based in your magical solar eleventh house of hopes and wishes, so something your partner does for you is likely to thrill you. The same house where Jupiter is based also rules your friends, so you may be invited to a glorious event that includes many happy people, a number of them close friends. If you go, it will be one of the sterling moments of 2023. You may be attending a special group dinner, wedding, convention, seminar, retreat, club meeting, or other event that draws many people together.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>On the July 3 full moon you also have Saturn in perfect angle to both the Sun and the full moon. Wow, this really is an ideal full moon. Saturn is taking the lead, indicating that your actions, decisions, or a promise you make (within the July 3 period) is likely to have great longevity and will help you build a firm foundation to support a major goal. If you become engaged, married, or sign papers with a proposed business partner (agent, lawyer, accountant, or another expert who can help you with your career), you have a fabulous outlook.</p>
<p>Another unusual and incredibly positive aspect at the full moon is that good-fortune Jupiter will be receiving comforting, stable aspects from Saturn. Both are individually harmonious to the Sun and full moon—and also to EACH OTHER. This makes it a wonderful time not only to reap profits and seed new sources of income, but also to travel overseas, whether for pleasure or business. (Jupiter is associated with, among other things, financial expansion and foreign travel.) Any goal associated with your trip is likely to materialize and be successful.</p>
<p>Like some of the other zodiac signs, higher-than-usual expenses may have concerned you lately. Just when you thought you had securely battened down all the hatches, the minute you turned around, one of those hatches blew open again. It’s been maddening. The culprit has been Mars in Leo, a constellation Mars first entered on May 20 and will remain in until July 10. Once Mars moves out of Leo, your expenses will drop.</p>
<blockquote><p>You only get one new moon in your sign of Cancer each year, and this year’s is on July 17—a big moment for you.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>You have additional reason to be enthusiastic about your emerging financial picture. In early March you said goodbye to taskmaster Saturn, who was filling your eighth house of other people’s money for nearly three years. And all that time Saturn was holding down your income. You may have also been saddled with debt, such as credit card debt, if you had to access cash quickly, or student loans. Saturn wanted you to appreciate the value of the money you earned and to set up effective structures for your finances so you could enjoy more financial security. I am sure that period seemed long.</p>
<p>Now the cap on your income will come off, for Saturn left this position in March and won’t return until 2050. If you worked with Saturn, you learned to access money from a bank, not credit cards. If you are self-employed, you learned you needed an accountant to help you estimate your taxes so you would not have panic attacks on Tax Day. If you owe student loans, you may have gone to a financial advisor to help you develop a plan to gradually pay down your debt.</p>
<p>If you work on commissions, royalties, licensing fees, or bonuses, your income will finally rise. Even if you say you did well during the past three years, it is clear you will likely do even better. I do not see your income going down, whether you work for others or are self-employed—when it comes to earning money, the sky’s the limit for you from now on. Proof of what I am saying will be delivered at the full moon August 1, plus or minus four days.</p>
<p>Also, you have a number of possible new sources of income and ways you will be able to access money in the coming month. Here are some examples. You may receive a sum for previously unpaid child support or get a check from an insurance company for a claim you sent. You may get news about an inheritance that may have been delayed in the courts, or receive a generous court settlement or division of property in a divorce agreement. One of these areas may light up for you.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>Additionally, you may see a release of funds through a bank loan, mortgage, venture capital, family, or another source. You will get to see that things are looking up financially very soon. All these matters will come up at the full moon August 1 that you will feel growing in fullness the last three days of July.</p>
<p>Now let’s backtrack a little to another one of my favorite parts of the month, July 17, when the new moon in Cancer, 25 degrees, will appear.</p>
<p>A new moon opens a door to an entirely new path. You only get one new moon in your sign of Cancer each year. This is a big moment. Uranus in Taurus will send a lovely greeting to the Sun and moon in Cancer (a sextile) and so I believe Uranus will bring surprise help from one of your friends concerning something you dearly want to happen.</p>
<p>At the same time, Neptune, positioned at the very top of your chart, will also chime in from his position in Pisces, adding his gifts of imagination and creativity to anything you may be involved in now. If it is an artistic, visual, or musical project, you will have plenty of help to make it a success.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at where Mars is going on July 10 after he leaves Leo and stops creating so many expenses for you.</p>
<p>Mars will head to Virgo on July 10 and stimulate your travel sector until August 27. This is a good place for you to host Mars, for Virgo (earth) is warmly compatible to your Cancer sign (water). You will be able to travel on weekends and for short-distance holidays. The type of travel indicated here would not be far—an overseas trip would be more likely to happen at the start of July.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>These short distances might be connected to your work, because Mars rules your solar tenth house of prestigious career success. Often face-to-face meetings are more effective than phone calls, Zoom calls, or emails. In your case, short trips made to generate business would be highly effective, whether you want to pitch a client an idea or negotiate a contract.</p>
<p>This month you may see more of your sister or brother too, as the house where Mars is heading rules siblings. Additionally, if you work in any branch of the communications business, you will be in demand during the coming weeks. By communication I mean writing, public speaking, editing, podcasting, app development, website design, public relations, publicity, social media work, advertising, marketing, coding, or other digital work, as some examples.</p>
<p>Saturn will directly oppose Mars on July 20, so Saturn will slow you down somewhat on or near that date. If you are dealing with a contractual situation (I see that as very possible), you may need to negotiate and change detailed clauses. Pluto will oppose the new moon in Cancer, so you may have a difficult but very powerful client who is hard to please—be ready. (Cancers born July 20-22 are most likely to experience this trend, which will be over by early 2024.)</p>
<p>Venus will retrograde this month from July 22 to September 3, and that is a rare trend. Venus only retrogrades every 18 months for about six weeks. This time, Venus will retrograde in Leo, your second house of earned income, so one or two checks you are expecting may arrive late during this period—you may have to send gentle reminder statements to people who owe you. Venus is not only associated with love, beauty, luxury, and fun, but also profits and money. On the flip side, it’s also possible that someone who has owed you money for a long time will finally send it! Venus retrograde can do that as well.</p>
<p>When it comes to love, if you are single, this is not the time to look for a new romantic partner. If you do meet an interesting person during this phase, you would be building a weak Venus into the “birth” of your relationship. Venus rules affection and warmth, and in a short time—even though the chemistry may seem exciting at first—emotions would likely cool off too quickly, leaving you scratching you head and asking, “What happened?”</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>When dealing with attractiveness, Venus retrograde (July 22 to September 3) is not the time to have cosmetic surgery. Avoid Botox, fillers, special dermatological procedures, and cosmetic dental work like veneers, and don’t make a radical change to the cut or color of your hair. If you want to try an expensive new line of skincare products, wait to buy your new items in the second half of September. For now, whether you are a man or woman, keep to the status quo. You can go for regular grooming and trims to your hair, for example, but do nothing dramatic. You may not like the results!</p>
<p>Before I go, I want to point out a beautiful, friendly, and rare aspect that is now just coming slowly into focus. It involves Uranus, the planet of surprise, unexpected developments, and Pluto, planet of power and big money deals, in your house of alliances, partnerships, and collaborations. By the end of July, Uranus and Pluto will start to form a “trine” collaboration (the most harmonious aspect possible). They will not make their exact aspect for several years, in mid-July 2026, and will continue to make aspects until May 2028. However, late this month Jupiter and Pluto will come within mathematical significance to form a trine. We have not had an aspect from Uranus and Pluto like this since 1921-1922.</p>
<p>What does this mean for you? It means a friend can help make a very powerful business association or social introduction on your behalf. Venus retrograde will cloud what is going on, but by September you will get a clearer view.</p>
<p>Mercury will retrograde too, starting next month (August 23 to September 15). For all practical purposes, we are moving into a slow period from the end of July to mid-September. You might welcome that—you’ve been working very hard. Get many key tasks done early in July, well ahead of Venus retrograde July 22, or table important actions until after September 15—the choice is yours. In the meantime, if you can, work in a trip, for you would enjoy it thoroughly.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Over the past year, your career took most of your attention, and rightly so—chances are, you were hitting one home run after another. Management was so impressed with you that they began to wonder, what is your secret sauce? Your secret is simply a combination of solid experience, talent, honed skills, good judgment, a fine work ethic, kindness and compassion, and an uncanny sense of intuition, all adding up to your big success.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve established your mettle, you can have more fun without fear that you will lose momentum or give up ground you worked so hard to build. Now you can turn your attention to the social, more relaxed, fun part of life, and that includes time for romance and vacations.</p>
<p>A case in point will be the glorious full moon in Capricorn on July 3, one of the best you’ve seen in months. You may be making a promise to a romantic partner. A portion of single Cancers may get engaged or wed over this weekend (July 1-3). No matter what transpires, Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, will be in fine angle to both the Sun and full moon, indicating one or more friends will also play a prominent role in your happiness at this time of the month. This is a full moon, so something is coming to culmination. Your spirits will be high, and that set of days will bring plenty of joyous experiences.</p>
<p>If the news you receive has nothing to do with romance, you may be forming a business partnership or ready to hire an agent, publicist, accountant, lawyer, or other professional you would work closely with in a confidential one-on-one way. It is also possible that you will seal a deal with a major client. Again, luck will be on your side.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>You might also see money or receive a valuable gift around the full moon on July 3. Emotionally, you’ll be riding a high point.</p>
<p>This will be a major month for you, for on July 17, you have the new moon in Cancer opening a new path for you—one filled with new opportunities. Not only will you likely be happy, but you will also likely hear good news (again) about money. Whatever comes up, it will come up suddenly and without any warning. The topic will be very important to you—it will have to do with something you’ve long dreamed would occur, and now it may be materializing before your eyes.</p>
<p>In the weeks to come after July 17, thanks to Neptune’s silvery beams to the Sun and new moon in Cancer, you may create something highly artistic or creative that makes you proud. This lovely output will allow others around you to understand the broad range of your talents.</p>
<p>As for money, since May 20 you’ve been in a period of high spending, and you may have wondered if the motherload of expenses would ever stop. Your output will slow down after July 10, when Mars moves out of your financial sector. After that, you will feel more in the mood for taking short trips and having fun on these outings.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <p>While you can, take advantage of your weekend getaways, for your home—or other property you own, rent, or want to buy or sell—will need your attention by the end of August through mid-October, and at that time it might be harder for you to travel.</p>
<p>As you get to the end of the month, you will feel the approaching full moon in Aquarius on August 1. You will be paying bills, but again, you will also see money coming in. The money you see will likely be career-oriented, because at the same time as the full moon, August 1, Mars (which rules your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement) will be in tight conversation with Jupiter, the Great Benefic. This suggests you may make a large commission or receive a royalty, bonus, or check owed to you for work well done, and it is likely to arrive on the very last day of July or in the first days of August. Life is sweet, dear Cancer, and you deserve every bit of your good fortune.</p>
