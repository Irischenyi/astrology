        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>This is a really good month, and after having been through a number of high-stress months since April, you will welcome July. July could also serve as a turning point, for your career and home life will attract your full attention, and there will be time for fun, love, and friendship, too. Let’s look closer.</p>
<p>The month starts out with a positively gorgeous full moon on July 3 in Capricorn, 11 degrees, shining like a beacon in your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement. I love that Jupiter, the good-fortune planet, will send a direct beam to that full moon, indicating to me that if you are starting a new job (or even if you are staying at your present job), a generous salary and other compensation seem to be in the cards for you. If you are self-employed, business should be brisk at the full moon July 3. And if you get publicity in the press or social media, your chances for big profits during this week doubles.</p>
<p>To be clear, you have two dazzling aspects that will appear earlier on July 1 that will be still strong on the full moon, July 3. The first one is the Sun and Jupiter in a sextile. A sextile is an aspect that is friendly and helps you if you take an initiation. Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, is shining in your second house of earned income like a diamond, gleaming in the Sun. A sextile aspect translates into an opportunity—you have to do something to take advantage of it—and I am sure you will, so if you want to ask for a raise, by all means, ask for one in the first week of July. You’ve waited 12 years to have Jupiter in this area of your chart, making this year, 2023, though May 25, 2024, a banner year for your income.</p>
<p>The other heavenly aspect that I referred to that’s happening at the full moon relates to Mercury in sextile to Jupiter, another show stopper. Mercury, speaking with Jupiter on your behalf at the full moon July 3, is the planet that rules communication—writing, speaking, editing, coding, and negotiating, as well as travel—and all these activities will proceed beautifully for you. This aspect is ideal for signing a contract. Mercury is currently based in Cancer, your home sector, so if you are closing on a house or signing a lease, the first week of July would be ideal.</p>

<p>Saturn will also bolster your full moon in Capricorn with respect to your career. Saturn will do that by sending an encouraging, helpful sextile aspect to the full moon, allowing Saturn to give you longevity to any new professional role you take on. If you are to remain in the same position, then it may be that the current project you’re working on will cement your role as a visionary. At the same time, a full moon in Capricorn will help you generate creative ideas, and it seems those ideas will be realistic and practical. (The Capricorn moon will be speaking here.) That’s a winning combination.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to mid-month when the new moon will appear on July 17 in Cancer, 25 degrees, and will switch your attention to home and family. If you need to move, this is a superb new moon to look for and find a new place to live that you will love. Uranus, the planet of surprise, will send a friendly beam to this new moon, opening the possibility for finding an apartment or house that’s perfect—the space will come up quite unexpectedly, out of the blue. Some Aries will be moving to take advantage of a good job based in a different area of the country. As you see, you have both prestigious career advancement and an ability to make improvements in your home this month.</p>
<blockquote><p>Home, career, and time for love are all in your future in July, so find ways to enjoy this glittering golden confetti falling from the heavens.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>You don’t have to move to take advantage of the new moon of July 17. You can do any number of things for your home—find the ideal piece of furniture or a bright new rug to brighten or cozy up a room. If you love the way your home looks, you can simply use the energy of the July 17 new moon to invite friends over for dinner or a small party. If you need a new housekeeper, or a new roommate to share the rent, you can interview candidates.</p>
<p>Alternatively, still thinking about the July 17 new moon in Cancer, you can do things for your family to make things work more smoothly. If you have a small child and feel you need a second nanny to pitch in when your regular nanny can’t come, early July would be the perfect time to hold interviews. Or you may simply need a person to pick your child up from school and perhaps start dinner for you and your children before you get home from work. (Children are always starving at around 5:30 PM when they come back from a long school day. My children were always that way!) Dinner at 5:30 PM might be too early for you if you can’t be home from work by then. In that case, having a helper at home will be worth her weight in gold.</p>
<p>In a different way to use the July 17 new moon, if your parents need help, such as to set up auto-pay on their computer to pay recurring bills, or if they need help packing boxes to store items, you may take time to see them and do all that is needed. A new moon in a home and family sector can make you quite productive.</p>
<p>Pluto will oppose the new moon on July 17, so you may feel pulled between the needs of career and those at home. Pluto is the planet in your chart that can help you rise magnificently in your career and even win awards and accolades between now and end of January. In fact, it is very possible you will get some sort of recognition, but Pluto’s placement here will demand you give all your attention to your work.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>Knowing this, you might need to hire someone to help out at home, particularly if you have children or a parent who depends on you. That helper can get you through the coming weeks and months. The best part of your chart will be the money you earn (again, you waited 12 years for Jupiter to journey to this part of your chart, and he wants you to make LOTS of money), so it looks like you might be able to afford to hire a full -or part-time helper. If you can’t do that (and I cannot see your entire chart from where I sit), you might be able summon help from your mother or sister.</p>
<p>The pressure I see that you might feel suggests you could be starting a job in a new company or getting a big promotion in your present firm, for it takes a bit of time to adjust to new circumstances. If neither of these examples is the case for you, you may simply be taking over a major new project that has many moving parts, and you will need to keep a sharp eye on the details.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at what your ruler, action planet Mars, will be doing, for Mars will give me a good indication of where your attention will be directed. The first days of the month, until July 10, Mars will be in Leo, a lovely place for you, for Mars will light up your fifth house of fun and romance.</p>
<p>Within the first nine days of July would be a good time to take a few days for a little out-of-town holiday. Venus will still be in Leo too (perfect for you), and Mars and Venus, who adore being together (but very rarely are) remarkably will be orbiting very close in the first days of the month, July 1 to 9. The job of Venus and Mars, when orbiting close, is to set off the sparks of love and also to bring fun, leisure, sports, and quality time with children. When it comes to romance, the early days of July will be ideal for you.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>Mars will soon have a new assignment, and he will have to leave Venus for now. Mars will be needed to energize your sixth house of work-a-day projects from July 10 to August 27. This means you will be very busy with assignments, and you may need to possibly hire new staff, too. As you see, your work life is taking a central role in your chart.</p>
<p>Adding to the emphasis on your career will be a very special (gorgeous) new moon that will occur two months from now, on September 14. I love that new moon, as it is one of the best of the year. It will be so harmonious. By mid-September you will have created an organized plan for your work assignments and feel more comfortable in your job. A new moon is never “just a day” but rather a portal of new energy that is strong for weeks and months. It seems by mid-September you will be familiar with changes in your work life and will be ready to slide into the driver’s seat, take the wheel, and speed your career forward.</p>
<p>At the very end of the month, you will begin to feel the approaching full moon on August 1 in the compatible sign of Aquarius (9 degrees), an air sign that blends so perfectly with your fire-sign element. It will send vibrancy to your friendship and social events sector, and this tells me you may have a major social event to look forward to, such as a friend’s wedding or gala-type party.</p>
<p>The full moon of August 1 will be time to kick back and have a fun, and it might even mark a romantic time with your present partner (but not to date someone new if single). You will feel the August 1 full moon as soon as July 29 and as late as five days after, to August 6.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>Why did I say it was not a time to date someone new if you are single? Venus is about to retrograde from July 22 to September 3, and when she does, Venus shuts off her powers in the areas she rules, namely, of fun, love, beauty, and pampering.</p>
<p>Venus retrograde is not a time to change your appearance in a dramatic way—no face lift, and no trips to the dermatologist for fillers or Botox. Avoid cosmetic dentistry, and don’t make a radical change to the cut or color of your hair. Keep to the status quo, and that holds for men, too. Venus rules all things that embellish, so don’t go shopping for expensive gems either—those sparkly diamonds and blue sapphires will still be there for you when this period is over, and you will enjoy your purchase more if you shop in September.</p>
<p>Venus retrograde is also not the time to begin dating someone new if you are single, for Venus rules affection, and although you may feel good chemistry at the start, the relationship might cool off too quickly, leaving you puzzled about what could have happened.</p>
<p>Last month in my June forecast, I gave you lots of detail on the fact that Venus will retrograde. If you want to see what I wrote about Venus last month you can always access the previous month’s forecast from my Internet site and my app. (We only keep one month prior available, so if you want to read it, do so soon. It will evaporate when I post August.)</p>
<p>Also, near month’s end, Uranus (surprise) in Taurus and Pluto (power) in Capricorn are getting closer to a perfect trine. They won’t hit a perfect aspect until 2026 to 2028, but they are already within mathematical significance (which means close enough to matter).</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>These two planets are setting up a link between your status in your industry and the money you will make. Pluto is associated with money and power, and Uranus is associated with all things unexpected. They will work together and give you a chance to make your mark.</p>
<p>In short, you are on quite a trajectory to a much bigger role in your company, industry, or even the world at large. You have a superb chance to make a big difference to others, so give your job everything you’ve got to give. Few people get a chance like the one I am describing for you because Pluto takes 248 years to circle the Sun, and Uranus takes 84 years to make the same journey.</p>
<p>As you see, home, career, and time for love are all in your future in July, so find ways to take full advantage of all these gifts falling like glittering golden confetti from the heavens.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>July will be a busy month, but it will be one you will welcome. It has none of the lumps and bumps of May and June, but rather, July will bring solid progress on a variety of goals. The month starts off with a full moon in Capricorn July 3, lighting your tenth house of career honors, awards, and achievement. You can notice the effects of a full moon from two days prior to five days after its appearance, and it seems very likely that you will get good news about your career. This could be a major point in 2023 for professional progress and mark the culmination of much effort on your part.</p>
<p>Saturn will be in a divine angle to both the Sun and full moon, stabilizing and adding to your position in your industry and also adding rock-solid stability to family matters. If you get a new position, promotion, special publicity, or new client, people who know you (or know of you) will view you in a new light—you seem to be gaining quite a bit of status. Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, will send golden, sparkly rays to the full moon and the Sun, indicating your compensation will likely be quite generous.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>Perhaps best of all, separately, Saturn will be in a rare and friendly alignment with generous Jupiter, offering an opportunity to create a strong sense of financial security and a likelihood of long-term gain from all you begin now.</p>
<p>In the romantic realm, Venus and Mars, the cosmic lovers, will orbit close in the perfect fire sign for you—Leo—so romance seems very possible in July’s first week. Uranus will be causing financial turbulence, however, making you think twice about spending a lot of money while socializing. If you keep careful track of your spending, you should be able to have your cake and eat it, too. I say go for it, dear Aries.</p>
<p>The new moon on July 17 will help you with your home and family. You might decide to look for a new space to live, or maybe you just want to spruce up you place a little with a few new elements. And if everything’s just as you like it, have a party for your friends.</p>
<p>As July winds down to a close, it seems you’ll be looking forward to an event that will draw many friends and acquaintances together, triggered by a glorious full moon in Aquarius August 1. At the very same time, good news stemming from your career may bring you the cash you need to participate fully in this event. You may be attending a concert, sporting event, conference, seminar, or large party. Any of these would bring fun with friends old and new. If your event is professional, there’s much to be gained from the information you’ll gather and the contacts you’ll make.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Aries</h2>
        <p>By month’s end, Uranus and Pluto will be edging close to a heavenly trine, an aspect not seen since 1921-1922. (These two heavy hitters of the solar system will make a series of exact aspects on July 18, 2026, November 29, 2026, June 15, 2027, January 13, 2028, and May 10, 2028). They’re close enough to be mathematically significant now, however, so you should notice their glow. Pluto is currently spending his last months in your tenth house of career before moving to Aquarius in January, and Uranus is currently in your second house of earned income.</p>
<p>Pluto and Uranus will work together for you, and under this alignment, you can grow into a very powerful, responsible, and influential career position and make a great deal of money, much more than you imagine. Of course, you must be part of this trend and work very hard and smart, but if you do, your efforts should be richly rewarded.</p>
