        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>As the month opens, your home and family will be the center of your universe thanks to a glowing peach of a full moon on July 3. This full moon will be in Capricorn, 11 degrees, and receive outstanding vibrations from Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck.</p>
<p>You may decide to include your family in your plans over the weekend of July 1 to 2 as the moon moves toward fullness on July 3, or you might have your parents, siblings, and children all together at an event sometime during the week that follows the full moon. Jupiter’s involvement makes this a joyous, exciting full moon. (Jupiter will be in a sextile, indicating you will have a chance to take complete advantage of this full moon.) If you are moving at the start of July, you will adore your new home.</p>
<p>Actually, anything you do in regard to your home will work out well in July’s first week. You could close on a house or see a renovation or massive repairs finish up. You might paint a room, or a beautiful piece of furniture you had purchased weeks ago may be delivered and make your room look perfect. Alternatively, it is possible you are renting a vacation cottage in a beautiful setting surrounded by trees or mountains (Capricorn speaking) and near water (Neptune will be adding his gifts), and you will use this cottage now or in a few weeks.</p>
<p>If your home is not the focus, then one of your parents, one of your children, or a sibling might be on your mind, and you may want to do something to improve this person’s life. Saturn will have a lead role at this full moon, and since it’s outstandingly friendly, it appears that if you make a home or family decision, it will be a wise one because Saturn will add stability. If you purchase property, your land would likely appreciate quite a bit over time thanks to Saturn’s current oversight.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>In a remarkably friendly planetary collaboration, Saturn will work with Jupiter, the planet of good fortune, and Jupiter will work equally well with Saturn from your financial eighth house ruling other people’s money. This full moon might also be the time you get the green light from your bank to receive a mortgage or home improvement loan if you had previously made an application. If you have been waiting for a check from your homeowner’s insurance company for a claim you sent or for word from the courts about an inheritance settlement involving property, this full moon will likely bring you that answer now—I believe you will be happy with the result.</p>
<p>The same is likely to be true if you are in a divorce and hoping to reach a resolution over a house (or more than one property accrued during your marriage)—this would be the time you could get the final agreement. Again, when it comes to property, it’s clear you would be pleased if you receive the answer in the first week of July.</p>
<p>You also have a lot going on in your career. The first two days of July are so splendid that I urge you to keep your cell phone powered up and your computer too, so that you can check email and respond if something comes up. Since you have the Sun in your tenth house of career advancement signaling to lucky Jupiter in a lovely sextile, you could receive a generous compensation agreement, possibly based on fee plus bonus or commission. Mercury is also in your prestigious tenth house of profession and will be linked in a beautifully harmonious way to Jupiter (also in a sextile)—I am feeling excellent professional news could reach you (Mercury rules communication). Be optimistic!</p>
<blockquote><p>Mars will move to Virgo on July 10 to stay until August 27. This will offer you an opportunity to kick back and completely relax from your normal routine.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>This is only the beginning of your happy career news. On July 17 you will have an important, friendly new moon in your solar tenth house of career honors, awards, and achievement. This is the only career-oriented new moon you will have in 2023, so this one is vital and will open doors for you. If you have been looking, this new moon will allow you to walk through the threshold of an opportunity.</p>
<p>Backtracking just a bit, at the time of the full moon on July 3, Venus, your ruler, will orbit close to Mars, Venus’ sweetheart, and both will be found in your eleventh house of friendship. This tells me that leading up to the new moon July 17, a friend will likely be instrumental in your career progress this month. Your friend may tip you off to a prestigious job (it will not be low level, that’s for sure), and your friend might even speak up for you.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Saturn, based in your actual day-to-day projects (sixth house), will be beautifully oriented to Jupiter (in yet another sextile), so I feel if you have your own business, you may bring in a new client after the July 17 new moon, and things should work out extremely well. This client is likely to become a long-term supporter.</p>
<p>Whether you’re self-employed or work for others, your compensation should be generous, and it seems you will be given a number of benefits from this company, such as health care insurance, which could be quite valuable if you had to pay for it yourself before. You may have the ability to work from home for some of the days of the week, which would save you from the expense and time of commuting.</p>
<p>There is one planet that might cause a little trouble at or near this new moon on July 17, and it is Pluto, positioned in Capricorn, your home sector. It could be that an older parent or child will need your attention, and you will have to figure out how to take a new, responsible position while you juggle responsibilities at home. Alternatively, Pluto could come in the form of a pushy landlord who either tells you that he or she sold the building (and you would have to move soon) or refuses to fix something in your home that you desperately need done (even though it would be the landlord’s responsibility to do it). Libras who have a birthday that falls on October 21 or October 22 would be most likely to feel Pluto’s influence, so if that is you, know that Pluto will move to Aquarius and out of this sticky spot by January 2024.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>Now let’s turn our attention to action-hero Mars who will spend his last nine days in Leo, your career sector. If there is anyone you still need to see, make your appointment in the days that span July 1 to 9. This is a golden time for you—some of the best days of the year fall in this period.</p>
<p>Mars will move to Virgo on July 10 to stay until August 27. This will offer you an opportunity to kick back and completely relax from your normal routine. Take your chance to spend time with those who mean the most to you, and when you socialize, you will want to focus on one person at a time with none of the usual distractions. You will favor quiet dinners over crowded cocktail parties.</p>
<p>By the time August nears an end, Mars will enter Libra, and he will stay there from August 27 to October 11. This will be the most important part of 2023 for you. It’s been two years since you’ve had Mars’ favor, which is a wonderful advantage because you will feel energetic and confident, and you will be in a position to rally others to your cause. You need to rest so you can be ready for when Mars enters Libra because, by then, you will have no time to relax—you will be moving at the speed of light.</p>
<p>You need to achieve as much as you can from July 1 to approximately July 18, leaving a space of days before your ruler Venus goes retrograde from July 22 to September 3.</p>
<p>During Venus retrograde, try to stick to routine matters. Venus rules beauty and attraction, so don’t schedule plastic surgery. Hold off on Botox or fillers, and don’t see your dentist about having your teeth fitted for veneers or have any other cosmetic dental work done. This is no time to try a new hair stylist or to ask for a radically new hair cut or color. If you want to experiment with a new fragrance or skin-care regime, wait until mid-September to buy it to be sure you will like it. Men, it might not be a wise idea to shave off your beard or to grow one—keep things as is rather than making a bold change to your face until mid-September.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>Venus retrograde is not the time to have a first date, so if you are single, relax, and put off looking for that special person you hope to marry someday. I don’t want you to include Venus retrograde in the DNA of the birth of your relationship. The reason is that Venus rules warmth, fun, and affection, and with Venus debilitated, you are likely to find the relationship will go flat after an otherwise exciting beginning. That would leave you puzzled. Instead, wait to date new people until the second half of September (and beyond). In the meantime, take a soothing, private vacation in a sumptuous natural setting, and go with family or friends.</p>
<p>If you are married, Venus retrograde won’t harm you because you would have met your spouse or established significant other some time ago. The fact that you are still together is a testament to your relationship’s strength.</p>
<p>Venus rules luxury and enjoyment, so instead of hosting any events now, schedule your lavish party or charity fundraiser for the second half of September or October.</p>
<p>I would like you to accomplish as many vital tasks as you can within the first two and a half weeks of July because Mercury is about to retrograde. Not only will Venus go retrograde from July 22 to September 3, but Mercury will go retrograde next month from August 23 to September 15, too.</p>
<p>As you get to the end of July, you will begin to feel the coming August 1 full moon in Aquarius, 9 degrees, as it grows in strength. It will be a favorite of yours—it will light your fifth house of true love, children, and creativity. You can feel a full moon two days before (July 30 to 31) and as many as five days after (August 1 to 6). If you’re seeing someone or you’re married, you will likely have a highly romantic episode at this time.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>Alternatively, you might focus on a child (as you approach the August 1 full moon), which can also be fun. Think of something you can do for your children or the children of someone close. With Uranus taking a leading role, make it a complete surprise. You could take a trip to an amusement park, but you could also do things in your own city—for a child, all of life is new, and what they will remember most will be the happy time they had with you.</p>
<p>An alternate way you can use this full moon will be to debut your artistic project after having worked on it for a long time. Uranus in Taurus will take the prominent role of all the planets at the full moon August 1 and will be at a sublime angle to Neptune in Pisces—this is significant. Uranus is the planet of innovation, especially in the sciences, and Neptune governs all the arts.</p>
<p>Both Neptune and Uranus will be friendly to each other, and both will also be amiable to Pluto in Capricorn, which shows the regenerative element that will form part of this full moon. You may be joyfully transformed by the work you’ve created by understanding the power of your originality and your need to express yourself—and also by the enthusiastic response others have to it.</p>
<p>Whether you enjoy romance, time with children, or the joy of unveiling something you’ve worked hard to create, this full moon could be special.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>This could turn out to be an exciting month. The two important areas of your life—your home and family and your career—are brightly lit up, so you may be making some big decisions to further a wish that is close to your heart.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>The full moon in Capricorn will arrive on July 3 in your home and family sector, and this will be one of the most joyous full moons of the year for you. Consider arranging a family celebration to bring all the members of your clan together—all ages, all types—because such a gathering would be sure to build a memory you’ll long remember. Mix friends with family, too—they will want to come to your event and will add just the right touch to bubble up lively conversation.</p>
<p>At this full moon, Jupiter will signal to the mighty Sun and tender full moon, so this day—and the days surrounding July 3—will burst with fun and also bring a touch of luxury. Additionally, you may receive a surprise gift or a one-time check connected to your work that will delight you in the generosity it reflects. Mars and his lover Venus will both tour your eleventh house of joy and happiness at the start of the month, so how could you possibly go wrong? In your case, you won’t!</p>
<p>As a Libra, you have been eager to move up in your career, a trend that started to bud in late March and continued to build in strength as you reached May and June. If you sent out feelers to possible employers (or even if you didn’t), you may now enjoy a big career break at the new moon on July 17 set to appear in your tenth house of professional honors, awards, and achievement. Any job you discuss and take under the light of this new moon is bound to give you greater status, power, and influence in your industry.</p>
<p>Neptune will chime in from your work-a-day sector, so if you are artistic, showcase your work on or just after July 17—you will be prized for your stylishness, originality, and the richness of your imagination. Uranus will be a strong player in the mix too, so this means that news of a career opportunity will come up suddenly—keep your cell phone powered up, and continually check your email.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>Will there be a glitch to this career offer? Maybe, but what you decide will be up to you. Pluto will be in conflict with this new moon, so there could be tension between your duties at home and all you will be expected to do in your new career choice. You may have to figure out how you can care for your child or an older relative while you work longer hours (or settle into your new role).</p>
<p>The company benefits given to you may turn out to be more valuable than the flat salary, so see if you can work on a performance deal (such as a commission or bonus, if you reach a certain benchmark), and also ask (at the appropriate time) about health insurance and any other company benefits being offered. Those are worth considerable money, especially if you’ve had to pay for them on your own.</p>
<p>As you get close to month’s end, specifically, July 30 to 31, you will begin to feel the moon growing to fullness, to peak on August 1 and be influential until August 6. This full moon might just be the most romantic of 2023. Now that taskmaster Saturn has left your fifth house of true love, you will find your romantic path to be smoother than it has been over the past three years. Parenting your children will also become easier, and although bringing up children requires work and sacrifice, you will begin to see the balance shifting toward much more fun, pride, and pleasure.</p>
<p>Venus is your ruling planet and will go retrograde from July 22 to September 3. You may feel that certain projects are not moving ahead quickly enough to please you, but see this as temporary. During this retrograde, if you are single, be content to wait until later in the year to search for your one truelove. When Venus—which rules love and beauty—is retrograde, affection simmers down to a very low level, and you would not want to build this aspect into the birth of your new relationship.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Libra</h2>
        <p>As for beauty and attractiveness, this is not a time to buy jewelry or expensive wardrobe items, nor is it a time to schedule Botox, fillers, veneers, or a dramatic new haircut or hair color. (Trims and touch ups are OK—but keep to the status quo.) You will make much better decisions and achieve more once you get beyond September 3, so it will be worth the wait.</p>
<p>You need to factor in next month’s Mercury retrograde, too—August 23 to September 15—because the retrogrades for Mercury and Venus, which both orbit close to Earth, will overlap. The weeks from July 22 to September 15 will go slowly, but that might be great news for you. You will have the opportunity to breathe and exhale, so take your chance. With Mars in your twelfth house (July 10 to August 27), you need to build up your energy for when Mars moves to Libra on August 27 until October 11—that will be a very busy time.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you will want to enjoy rest, privacy, and fun times with your family or very close friends. They love you, and they will show you how much they care in so many ways.</p>
