        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>You are on an extraordinary trajectory toward major career success, and you have every opportunity to put your name in lights on the big marquee. It does not matter what industry you work in—a big heavy door that you assumed would always be locked is opening for you. So much of the work you have already put into your career is now coming into play, and if you have not already been lauded for your sterling performance, you soon will be.</p>
<p>July holds so much promise. It is a far better month than the last several months you’ve been through. Many little planets are spinning around, and almost all of them are trying to outdo one another to see that you receive the very best opportunities to advance your professional life.</p>
<p>You have Uranus, the planet of all things unexpected, in Taurus, your tenth house of prestigious career achievement—a seven-year trend that started in 2018 before fully settling in March 2019 to stay until 2026 when Uranus moves permanently into Gemini.</p>
<p>Uranus in Taurus has the power to make you famous and gain applause and awards. Success in your career would likely come up suddenly from time to time. Of course, you have to partner with the universe and show you are interested in getting ahead. You need to stay alert so you can grab opportunities with both hands when they unexpectedly come your way. Rarely have you had a chance to make it to the top of the mountain.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>Additionally, since May 16 this year, Jupiter, the great planet of good fortune, moved into your prestigious tenth house of career and will stay until next year, May 25, 2024. Jupiter’s job is to thrill you—he is like Santa Claus because he asks nothing in return for the splendid gifts he gives you.</p>
<p>Your first big moment to scale great heights will come immediately in July’s first week thanks to the full moon in Capricorn, 11 degrees.</p>
<p>This full moon will receive a direct beam from Jupiter, based at the very top of your chart. This suggests that a project you are finishing right now is likely to be met with critical applause and adulation, and this accomplishment will put another star on your lapel. This current project or decision you are making in the first week of July (or a decision you already made during the last days of June) will work very much in your favor.</p>
<p>This is the first time in over a decade that you’ve had an advantage from Jupiter in the solar career area of your chart. Jupiter will shine like a glittering star at the pinnacle of your chart until May 25, 2024, making you the luckiest sign of the zodiac for achieving impressive career gains.</p>

        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>Looking closer at the full moon on July 3, Saturn will be the planet that takes center stage. Remarkably, Saturn will be outstandingly friendly to the Sun and the full moon, and ALSO send a sparkling vibe to Jupiter in Taurus. In a rare collaboration, Saturn will work beautifully with Jupiter, and Jupiter will work equally well with Saturn—amazing! Not only can you find a professional role that will make you happy in the workforce, but this would also likely be a choice you enjoy so much you will appreciate your decision for a long time. That is what Saturn is known to do when in a friendly position—provide longevity to our decisions.</p>
<p>Next let’s look at the new moon on July 17 in Cancer, 25 degrees, to fill your peaceful twelfth house of solitude and reflection. From this point until the end of the month, it will be a perfect time to withdraw from social events and simply take time to reflect on which direction you’d like to drive your life. You may be thinking about your career but also about your relationships. During this period (July 17 plus two weeks), your intuition will reach an all-time high, so listen to the small voice within for clues. Mars, who wants to race ahead, will oppose Saturn (exact on July 20), who wants to slow down, and Saturn will win.</p>
<p>Pluto will oppose the Sun and new moon, suggesting someone who reports to you may challenge you (I know, a shocking thought). This person could be a competitor or a subordinate who wants your job or credit for your savvy decisions. This person has a very high opinion of themself, but I don’t think the rest of the world shares that perspective. Keep focused on your own projects.</p>
<p>Many Leos work in the arts, for you were born with a sophisticated taste and a keen sense of color and design. Many Leos also have an excellent feel for entertainment. Thanks to a beautifully oriented Neptune at the new moon on July 17, a creative project you may be working on now could bring stellar results.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>Let’s think about money now because I feel your quest to find the right career focus might be fueled by Saturn’s recent entry into your eighth house of other people’s money. Taskmaster Saturn tends to constrict what it touches, and in your chase, Saturn may hold down your income or bring difficult credit card, tax, or student loan payments. The timing of Saturn’s arrival in this house (for the coming three years) could not be worse because the world is in the throes of high inflation.</p>
<p>You don’t seem to be interested in only making a higher paycheck—you want to feel the satisfaction gleaned from putting your talents to good use so that, ultimately, you can be a part of making the world a better place than the one you were born into. Trust that you can find the answer because this new moon on July 17 will be the ideal one to help you learn what it is.</p>
<p>Adding to the need to make a higher salary will be the move of Mars to Virgo from July 10 to August 27. During the coming weeks you may be spending more money than usual. Perhaps you know you will have to pay for your child’s camp or buy a car or will have other large expenses. Sometimes when life puts pressure on us, we feel compelled to reassess our jobs and to find solutions, and suddenly, we move into a better place. You truly do have the perfect chart to have these meditations.</p>
<p>Venus will be retrograde in Leo from July 22 to September 3. You don’t have a lot of experience with Venus retrograde because Venus does not go out of phase very often, only every 18 months for about six weeks. Venus rules love, fun, luxury, beauty, and also money, and when Venus is retrograde, there are a number of things you should not do.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>I like to see a space of days prior to the start of a retrograde, so if you cannot attend to some of the following items that might be on your to-do list in the first 15 days of July, then delay any plans for the following:</p>
<p>Don’t schedule plastic surgery or dermatological procedures, including ones that involve Botox or fillers. Put off cosmetic dental surgery or a request for veneers. Also, don’t make a radical change to your hair color or cut. Venus rules beauty, so if you wanted to try a pricey new skin-care routine, I suggest you buy all the items in the first half of July or the second half of September. Venus also rules all things that embellish, like diamonds and precious jewels—you can shop for those and other expensive items either in early July (first two weeks) or in the second half of September. This is also not the time to give a lavish party or to hold a la-di-da charity fundraiser, for in the latter case, donations may turn out to be lower than expected.</p>
<p>If you are single, don’t venture out on a new, first-time date. In fact, spend Venus retrograde with a friend, and put off looking for a romantic partner during the weeks she is retrograde. Venus rules warmth and affection, so if you choose to make your first contact and initial date with a possible romantic partner, you will be building a weak Venus into the DNA of the birth of the relationship. Your pairing may start out happy and exciting but soon grow from cool to cold, making you wonder what you ever found interesting in this person to begin with. Save yourself the heartache—stay home and read a good book, or travel with friends. In truth, your best time to find genuine love, dear Leo, will be at year’s end during holiday festivities from November 24, 2023, to January 4, 2024, while Mars is in Sagittarius.</p>
<p>If you are married or dating seriously, you will not likely be too affected by Venus retrograde because you met your partner a long time ago, and you are likely getting along happily with each other.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>I should tell you that Mercury will retrograde next month from August 23 until September 15—another reason to achieve as much as you can in the first three weeks of July. If you need a car, computer, or smartphone, as three examples of purchases that run on electronics, buy it as early in July as possible, or put off shopping until a few days after September 15.</p>
<p>Speaking of your partner, if there is a special person you have been dating, or are now married to, the full moon on August 1 will put a big spotlight on this person. You will feel the full moon growing to a crest during the three days of July into the first six days of August. This should be a happy moment, and you may be traveling together.</p>
<p>There is one indication that you may need to be careful—Venus in Leo will be at 90-degree odds with Uranus in Taurus on August 9, but you could feel it as part of the August 1 full moon. (Unpredictable Uranus will take the dominant role at this full moon.) A casual comment could become very hurtful. Be diplomatic—I hope your partner will do the same for you. This may turn out to be a large or small test for your relationship. If this alliance means a lot to you, tread carefully, and be sensitive to your partner’s feelings.</p>
<p>If you are a Leo with no current romantic partner, you may see this emphasis on partnership play out in a committed business collaboration or partnership. Either way, the same advice applies—be gentle, caring, and supportive if the relationship is important to you. If you have been unhappy with your partner in business or in matters of love, this August 1 full moon could bring an urgency to make you decide what you need to do.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>Now let’s turn to something exciting that’s shaping up by this month’s end. Uranus rarely speaks to Pluto, but now these two slow-moving planets are gradually edging into position in deep space to get ready for a divinely harmonious trine to occur on July 18, 2026, three years from now. These planets move like little turtles, so they will already be within significant mathematical range by the end of July. Uranus and Pluto have not been in a trine position since 1921 to 1922. (These two planets did make an exact conjunction in the latter part of 1965 and during 1966. We are still part of that cycle.)</p>
<p>Right now in your chart, Jupiter is in your house of fame and honors as he moves through Taurus, and Pluto is in Capricorn, your work-a-day sector. This suggests that one or more special projects you’re working on now through January 2024 (at which time Pluto will change signs) will have the power to elevate your reputation and put you in a new realm.</p>
<p>Give your work everything you can because you’re on a roll, heading to the very top of your field.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You’re doing well in your professional life, and you will see proof of this within five days of the appearance of the full moon on July 3. A project may be reaching culmination, and you’ll receive great applause and appreciation from your client or management. Alternatively, you may be ready to hire a person who will report to you, and if so, this person is likely to turn out to be a gem, adding to your growing status. Jupiter, the planet of good fortune, will send a perfect vibration to the Sun and full moon, giving you a feeling of jubilance and optimism about the future.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>A lot seems to be taking place behind the scenes at work all month but particularly at the new moon on July 17. You may feel you are being pressured unfairly in your personal or professional life to take a certain position that you feel is wrong, which you’re resisting. This tension may stem from someone who is a competitor or a person who views themself as equal to you but actually isn’t. I doubt this person is any real threat. Be content to build a strategy for your own goals—you will benefit by working alone and keeping your ideas hidden from prying eyes. Artistic projects are particularly favored due to Neptune’s support.</p>
<p>Thanks to a very rare cooperation (a heavenly trine) between Uranus in your career sector and Pluto in your work-a-day project area, you are feeling freer and more confident while showcasing your talents and expressing your taste and creativity. This is a trend that will only grow in strength because Uranus and Pluto won’t make their exact aspect until July 2026. Being such slow-moving planets, Pluto and Uranus will be within significant mathematical proximity this month as you get closer to July’s end and beyond.</p>
<p>As you arrive at the last three days of July (July 29 to 31), you will start to feel the energy of the approaching full moon on August 1 in Aquarius. You may be making a serious promise to an individual in love or business. You might be getting engaged or making a pact with your present spouse for a goal you could work on together, such as saving for a house or a glorious vacation.</p>
<p>When it comes to romance, if you are single, be cautious. Venus is currently in Leo (very good) but is about to go retrograde in Leo from July 22 to September 3 (not good). Venus rules love and beauty, and both will be suppressed during this Venus retrograde. Don’t change your appearance in any significant way—that includes having Botox or fillers, getting veneers from your dentist, or asking for a radical hair style or color change from your stylist. (You can have simple trims and other grooming procedures.)</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Leo</h2>
        <p>If you plan to wed from July 22 onward (or in August up until September 3) and you are worried that Venus is out of phase, there is a workaround. Secretly marry at the city courthouse in the first half of July. Tell no one about your plan—not even your parents.</p>
<p>The July 3 full moon is quite wonderful. On July 1, Jupiter will make an exact sextile (the best aspect possible) to the mighty Sun, your ruling star. Any time the Sun is involved in any supreme aspect, that is golden for you—your ruler is always weighted more heavily in your chart.</p>
<p>These dates, July 1 to 3, or the few days that follow, would be ideal for your secret wedding. From there, even though you are married in the eyes of astrology and the country you live in, you can have your big ceremony on the day you chose. In the future, always celebrate the joyous wedding day you had originally chosen, knowing you have worked with the cycles of the universe perfectly.</p>
<p>If you have a business partnership to formalize, such as retaining an associate, new accountant or lawyer, agent, publicist, or other professional, your lawyer may say the contract is ready for signature. In that case, you can sign immediately, preferably in the first half of July.</p>
