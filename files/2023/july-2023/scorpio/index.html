        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>July will be a glorious month to travel far and wide. You are tired of routine and need a break, so you could not have chosen a better month than this one. The full moon on July 3 in Capricorn, 11 degrees, is one of the best of the year, full of sweetness and light—in truth, this is one of the best full moons we will see all year.</p>
<p>I am enthusiastic about this full moon for several reasons. First, Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, will send a sublime golden beam to the Sun on July 1, a little earlier than the full moon, but these two celestial bodies, moving slowly, will still be close on July 3, and they will form a big part of the goodness of this full moon. Additionally, Mercury, the travel and communication planet, will also receive a golden beam from Jupiter on July 1, so you are getting a double dip of luck and happiness during the first week of July from Jupiter, the Sun, and Mercury. This full moon will light your third house of short travel, so you will most likely head to a beautiful destination by car, rail, or bus. Capricorn is an earth sign, so you would likely be drawn to tall mountains and cool, thick forest settings.</p>
<p>Your third house, where this full moon will appear, rules written and verbal agreements—both can form binding agreements in astrology and in most localities. (To give you an example, a verbal agreement is legally enforceable for one year where I live in New York—check what the law says in your region.)</p>
<p>If you need to sign a contract (or you already signed one recently, and you are waiting for the other party to countersign and send your copy back to file), I feel all will be finished during the first week of July. This would be a sublime time to make any type of agreement. This assumes your lawyer says the contract is ready—if it is, go ahead and sign, and expect all the best.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>Not only are Mercury (news and agreements) and Jupiter (money, happiness, and expansion) outstandingly friendly, but Saturn is, too—in a big way, just like Mercury and Jupiter. Saturn’s involvement is important because a full moon in Capricorn puts Saturn in charge. Saturn is based in your fifth house of love, ruling all matters related to children and creativity. If you are single, you may meet someone interesting early in the month, and if you’re attached, you will have a very romantic experience with your spouse or the person you’ve been dating.</p>
<p>Saturn will bring long-term gains from your experience at this full moon (the area of influence is July 1 to July 6 as the moon wanes), so watch and see what comes up. You will have quite a wonderful experience.</p>
<p>You have another lovely lunation two weeks later—this time it will be a new moon in Cancer at 25 degrees. A new moon always brings fresh energy and new opportunities to the area of your chart where it falls, and in your case, this is your solar ninth house. Most Scorpios will want to travel again. If you do travel, a new moon in Cancer will lure you to turquoise waters.</p>

        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>Additionally, Neptune, the planet that governs the sea and all bodies of water, will send a silvery trine beam to the Sun and new moon in Cancer. Neptune is currently strong because it has been traveling (for years) in the sign it rules, Pisces. This is more evidence that you will be drawn to an enchanting setting by water. (If you live in the Southern Hemisphere, you may go skiing or be somewhere near snow.) Since Neptune also rules unconditional love, you will likely be inspired by your partner and enjoy every minute of your time together.</p>
<p>Your partnership sector (seventh house) contains Uranus, which is also sending glittering rays to this gorgeous new moon on July 17, so if a trip comes up, it will likely arise suddenly and spontaneously. With the Sun in your ninth house, any long-distance trip you take could be for business, but that’s not clear—your trip could be for pure pleasure, or perhaps you will combine business with pleasure.</p>
<p>While not every Scorpio will travel at the July 17 new moon and in the weeks that follow, you will have an array of other opportunities. If you work in the media—in publishing or broadcasting—you will have a chance to progress by leaps and bounds in your industry.</p>
<p>If you’re attending a college or graduate school, your advancement will also be favored, and this new moon will open doors for you. If you work with other countries, you will find that international relationships, import-export, and matters related to immigration (such as a passport or residency card) will progress smoothly. If you need to file a patent, trademark, or any legal action, perhaps to start a suit, you would be favored now, too.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>The new moon on July 17 is generally positive. Mars will meet up with Saturn who is standing in the doorway, temporarily preventing progress—Saturn is trying to slow you down to make sure you don’t move too fast. Two important planets are about to retrograde anyway (I will explain that in a minute), so it is a wise idea to adopt a slower pace that can allow you to think through your plans more thoroughly. In that respect, these retrograde planets will benefit you by allowing you to look closer.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to see what Mars is doing, for Mars is your second ruler, and it is a reliable planet to point to where your attention will be directed. (After I show you what Mars is up to, I will get to the retrograde planets, of which Mars is NOT one of them.)</p>
<p>Mars will be in Leo as you enter the month, but he will quickly move to Virgo on July 10 to stay until August 27. You have been hosting Mars at the pinnacle of your chart, so it looks as though you were focused on your career in May and June, no doubt making strides. When Mars leaves, that won’t be the end of your career surge upward because you have a new moon next month in Leo on August 16 to light your same prestigious career point in the sky, so you could easily see a professional breakthrough in the days that follow that new moon.</p>
<p>If you recently accepted a new job, your new company might send out a press release next month about your lofty new position. A new moon is the most important aspect you can have to see productivity and progress in the house in which it appears. You are lucky you have a fabulous professional new moon in August, one that will offer a perfect golden triangle that will harmoniously bring together Uranus in Taurus (surprise), Pluto (your ruler, governing big money deals) in Capricorn, and Mercury (news) and your other ruler Mars (action), both in Virgo.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>The new moon on August 16 in Leo will be influential for weeks and months after it occurs, although this new moon will be strongest in the ten days that follow its appearance on August 16.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to the retrograde planets.</p>
<p>You need to be aware that Venus will go retrograde this month on July 22 until September 3, and Mercury will do the same next month from August 23 to September 15.</p>
<p>This behooves you to do as much as you can this month in the first two and a half weeks of July before things begin to slow down. Venus, Mercury, and Mars are the planets that we feel the most when retrograde because they orbit closest to Earth. Here we see that two out of three will go silent for a while. Mars will remain in fine shape all year, but it is the other two that we need to be concerned about. (We feel all the outer planets less sharply when retrograde for they are much farther out in space.)</p>
<p>There are things you can do and should not do when Venus is retrograde this month and when Mercury goes retrograde next month. You are probably not too familiar with Venus retrograde because Venus rarely goes out of phase, specifically every 18 months for approximately six weeks. Venus rules beauty and grace, but when she sleeps, she withholds her greatest powers.</p>
<p>Once you get to July 22, delay cosmetic procedures, including Botox, fillers, and cosmetic dental work, and refrain from asking your stylist to recommend a radical new haircut or color.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>Venus rules love too, so Venus retrograde is not the time for singles to date in an effort to find their one truelove when warmth and affection are at a low point. When Venus is debilitated at the time of a first date (the official birth of the relationship), love often cools off before long. Married or long-term relationships are not nearly as affected by this Venus retrograde because those couples have been together a long time and have proven their strength.</p>
<p>Venus also rules all that embellishes as well as luxury—put off buying diamonds, emeralds, and rubies, for example. (This one is the easiest for me to refrain from doing. I am not due to shop for those any time soon.) This is not the time to give a lavish party or a charity fundraiser as Venus is also connected to money, and donations are likely to be less generous than expected.</p>
<p>When Mercury is retrograde next month from August 23 to September 15, it would not be an ideal time to sign a legal document or to buy any product that relies on moving parts or electronics to function, like a car, computer, or smartphone, as some examples. Mercury is mainly an intellectual planet, so when out of phase, your judgment is not as sharp, and you might become forgetful or display cloudy thinking.</p>
<p>We all tend to lose things during these times, the reason you shouldn’t wear your favorite sunglasses, for you are more likely than usual to leave them in a taxi on in a store. We have to be very deliberate about everything we do while Mercury is retrograde to make sure we have not left something of value behind on a transportation carrier, like an airplane, train, or Uber (Mercury rules travel and transportation).</p>
<p>You can travel when Mercury is retrograde, but delays crop up, or we have to deal with workers on strike (especially in regard to travel and transportation), leaving the rest of us struggling to get from point A to point B. It’s always a good idea to double check your accommodations before leaving the house, and also call your airline on the morning of your flight to find out if your flight is still on time. I always bring my computer and the AC cord with me to the airport so I can at least remain occupied if delays crop up.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>Despite all this, you’re one of the signs that could enjoy Mercury retrograde as you will probably run into old friends, even while just doing errands around your neighborhood.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to the end of July when the moon will be reaching fullness on August 1 in Aquarius, 9 degrees, your house of home and family. Something is coming to a culmination, and you will begin to feel the full moon growing in strength as early as July 29. This full moon will put Uranus in charge, but Uranus will be in hard angle to Venus, suggesting you may have an expense connected with your home, whether you rent or own your space. You might hear that your rent is going up or that you need to move, and this will become apparent at this full moon.</p>
<p>Still, the August 1 full moon has a lot going for it. Uranus, the planet of surprise, won’t be all bad—Uranus will be within range of a heavenly trine to Pluto, which is rare. We have not seen such an aspect since 1921 to 1922. Keep in mind that Pluto is your ruler, so although everyone will love this aspect, you will love it more because Pluto is given more weight and presence in your chart. Uranus and Pluto did have a conjunction in 1965 to 1966, and we are still being affected by that conjunction.</p>
<p>Uranus and Pluto will not make their exact trine until July 2026 to May 2028, making several sweet and heavenly trine aspects (120 degrees) during that stretch. Both planets are very slow moving, yet they will have already traveled into a significant area of influence of the divine trine position by the end of July. Pluto is connected with the government, so if you are in a bind with your home, property, or a family matter (possibly involving a child or parent), look into government programs that might be able to help someone in your position. Or call your congressman or other leader that covers your jurisdiction for advice.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>You have two rulers, and the other one is Mars. I love that Mars will be making an ideal trine to Jupiter in your partnership house. This is one of my favorite aspects—Mars gives energy, and Jupiter brings financial rewards from actions taken at the time (in your case, this will happen at the approaching full moon on August 1). It looks like your lawyer, real estate broker, accountant, or even your spouse could be worth their weight in gold at this time.</p>
<p>If you are moving, make sure you mark all boxes clearly. It looks as though you will love your new space. You are doing so well in your career that you might be able to trade up to a larger, sunnier space to live and perhaps have it closer to where you work or to family. You can make this full moon work for you, dear Scorpio.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>July will be tailor-made for travel. Over the full moon in Capricorn on July 3, you may want to take a little drive into the country to a nearby spot in the mountains. This will be the best full moon you’ve experienced lately—this one bursts with fun, so if you can take a small getaway and stay overnight, you would enjoy yourself to the fullest. Your sister or brother may have a role during this full moon and invite you to stay at his or her vacation cottage or house.</p>
<p>Jupiter will take a major role at this full moon, adding a touch of luxury and beauty—the reason this full moon will differ from others and stand out as one of the sweet spots of 2023.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>Going on your short trip at the start of the month will not quell your appetite for travel—it will only increase your craving for more. The universe will cooperate, and the new moon in Cancer on July 17 could set you off on another trip, one that will take you much farther away. You may go to a beautiful setting that will require your passport for entry and be near water. If a trip does come up, it will happen suddenly and surprise you.</p>
<p>Signing a contract will also be favored this month—do so early in the month when you will have such strong help from Jupiter at the full moon on July 3 and in the days that span July 1 to July 6.</p>
<p>You will also have luck with foreign people and places as well as matters involving citizenship, immigration, and a visa or residency card. If you are interested in going for an advanced degree at a college, the new moon on July 17 will be helpful to you as well. Finally, if you work in the communications or entertainment industry, the media will be very fortunate for you after this new moon appears.</p>
<p>Travel in July, but be home as you get closer to the end of the month. A lot is being stirred in your career, and if you have been interviewing for a new position, you may hear news within three days prior to the full moon on August 1, and allow for five days after, too—that is this full moon’s areas of influence. It may be quite exciting when a dream job becomes yours.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Scorpio</h2>
        <p>By the August 16 new moon next month, even more career news will bubble up, requiring you to be home and ready to answer key questions and make decisions. By all appearances, it appears you will be able to elevate your status in your industry in August. You might hear friends say that nothing much happens in August, but you will be the exception to the rule.</p>
<p>A new moon like the one on August 16 (as well as the one this month on July 17) will open new opportunities. After the new moon on August 16 appears, mark down August 24 as an especially sparkly day for you—the transiting moon will be in Scorpio, and Mars and Pluto will move to perfect harmony. Mars and Pluto are your two rulers, so Thursday, August 24 is a day to watch.</p>
<p>Be ready—the period from July 17 to the end of August will be important for your future career. It’s all so exciting!</p>
