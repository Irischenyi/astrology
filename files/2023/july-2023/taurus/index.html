        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>The past months have been replete with challenging aspects, so you will be glad you’ve come to July. Every zodiac sign will get a break now, but you are one sign that might need it the most.</p>
<p>You came through the difficult May 5 eclipse, and the closer your birthday falls to that date, the more stress you likely felt. No matter. You have accepted changes and moved on, and there will only be one more eclipse in the family of Taurus-Scorpio. That one will arrive as a full moon lunar eclipse in Taurus on October 28, and it is due to be a milder one than most of the ones you’ve experienced. After that one in October, there will be no more eclipses to affect Taurus so directly in the coming nine years.</p>
<p>You recently welcomed Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, to Taurus on May 16, and Jupiter is now settling into your sign, ready to protect you. Jupiter will do more than that—he will also find opportunities for you. VIPs will look kindly on you, and you will find it easier to get your foot in the door to present your ideas, experience, and skills. Jupiter will expand your perspective of life—you will see possibilities in projects and relationships that you might have previously viewed in narrow terms. Finding true love is also very possible when Jupiter is in Taurus, as you have now for the first time in 12 years. Jupiter will be with you in Taurus until next year, May 25, 2024, and continue to focus his golden liquid light on you, sure to bring happy events and a reason to fully enjoy life again.</p>
<p>The full moon in Capricorn, 11 degrees, on July 3 is glittering. Your stars are acting like little loving relatives who want you to let go a little and have fun. The full moon on July 3 will be in compatible earth-sign Capricorn and receive a strong, direct fortunate beam from Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck. Travel would be an ideal way to use this full moon, and if you go, you will have a chance to experience a touch of luxury.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>You are most likely to travel to a destination in a setting with tall, majestic mountains—you may be in a scenic spot with a breathtaking view, or you may choose to settle into a cozy spot in the valley, surrounded and protected by those mountains. Jupiter in Taurus is urging you to travel far, so you may take a trip overseas in the first week of July, a great idea, for this full moon will light you ninth house of foreign and distant travel. If you are not traveling to a country that will require your passport, you will have many chances to do so later this year as well as in the first five months of 2024 while Jupiter remains in Taurus.</p>
<p>If you cannot travel, you may work on an immigration or passport matter, or one involving a visa or residency status. Again, anything involving international travel or relationships (including import-export or moving to another country) would likely come out in your favor. Other ways to use this full moon successfully include settling a legal matter, finishing a manuscript or report, or staging an important speaking event. A goal to earn a college or advanced graduate degree will also bring progress and good news.</p>
<p>This full moon of July 3 will wrap up a matter ruled by this house, like the areas listed above. The message of the full moon will arrive no later than July 7. I love that Saturn will be beautifully oriented toward the full moon (in a 60-degree sextile, indicating opportunity) and be trine the Sun (a heavenly aspect denoting supreme harmony). The actions you take will have long-term gain and bring on a feeling of financial and emotional security.</p>
<blockquote><p>It looks as though your star is on the rise and that your name will be on many lips in your industry.</p></blockquote>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>In the first nine days of the month, you may temporarily finish up a large emphasis on a family, home, or other property-related matter. Mars has been in your fourth house of home since May 20, and Mars will leave your domestic sector on July 10. At that point, you will temporarily move your attention away from these matters.</p>
<p>Then, at the new moon next month on August 16, and the weeks that follow, you will again focus your attention on home and family matters. Uranus will be in conflict with Mars early this month near the full moon July 3, so sudden news about your property (whether you rent or own) or news that has to do with a family member (most likely a parent) may come up and require a quick solution. You won’t see this coming.</p>
<p>More travel is apt to come up on or in the days after the new moon on July 17, which will fall in Cancer, 25 degrees, your third house of nearby travel. This time, if you take a trip, it would likely be closer to home and to a soothing setting near water. With a new moon in Cancer, this might represent a family vacation where you can treat your children or parents to a pretty setting. The third house rules siblings too, so your sister or brother may come to visit you, or you may be traveling to see your sibling.</p>
<p>As this new moon will light your third house, there is another way you might choose to use this new moon. The third house has a lot to do with communication—writing, editing, speaking, computer coding, and negotiating and sales as some examples. You may be starting work on a website or developing an app, finishing your novel or screenplay, writing a press release or advertising copy, or launching a podcast series.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>You may instead be pouring over the details of a contract. Pluto will be in direct opposition to this new moon, so you may have problems negotiating with a client, for your client may take the stance of “my way or the highway”—also referred to as using a “scorched earth” method of negotiation.</p>
<p>At the same time, Uranus in Taurus will be on the sidelines, watching what is going on, and will jump in to help. Uranus in Taurus will be in position to send the Sun and new moon, both in Cancer, a helpful beam (a sextile). This suggests that a non-traditional, unusual, and innovative solution that you come up with could break the ice and get the contract done. With Uranus in your sign, you are going through a highly imaginative, creative stage, so you will be perfectly capable of coming up with the kind of solution I see. Additionally, Uranus rules your mid-heaven—the cusp of your tenth house of prestigious career advancement—so Uranus will be helping you rise in stature in professional matters.</p>
<p>If you do travel mid-month, after the new moon July 17, you are most likely to pack and go spontaneously. As you read this, I don’t think you already know you are going anywhere. As said, you may travel to see family or to work on a personal real estate matter that pertains to your family. Or you may want to see your client face-to-face so that you may be able to move a project forward more effectively. Of course, it is also possible that you’re looking forward to taking a few days off, unplugging your phone, and doing nothing more important than sip iced tea while you relax in a lounge chair on a powdery white beach, watching sail boats breeze by on crystal turquoise waters.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at Venus, your ruling planet, whose job it is to take good care of you. Venus is currently in Leo, your home sector, and will remain there for months. Considering that Venus typically stays only one month in a sign, you may be wondering why Venus, the planet of love, happiness, beauty, fun, and luxury will spend so much time in one sign, Leo, until October 8.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>The answer is that Venus will go retrograde in Leo starting July 22 and go direct on September 3. During the time Venus will be napping you will not have access to her greatest powers. It would not be the time to date a new romantic interest, but if you have already been dating seriously or are married, you will not be affected by Venus retrograde too much. It’s simply not wise to put Venus retrograde into the “birth” of a new relationship—Venus brings warmth and affection, and without her powers, the alliance could go flat emotionally before it even had a chance to get started.</p>
<p>Venus retrograde is also not the time to schedule any dramatic changes to your looks—no Botox, fillers, face lifts or cosmetic surgery, cosmetic dental work, or radical change to your hair style or color (regular trim and maintenance is fine). Venus has a lot of sway over your attractiveness. It’s also not a time to buy expensive precious gems or pricy wardrobe items.</p>
<p>I wrote quite a bit about Venus retrograde last month, so if you like, you might want to check your June forecast for more detail. You can always access the forecast for the previous month on my Internet site or on my app, Astrology Zone Horoscopes (Apple, Google Play). We only keep the previous month up—we do not archive forecasts beyond that.</p>
<p>In your case, Venus, your ruler, will spend a lot of time in your solar fourth house of home and family until October 8, so I feel you may be focused quite a bit on your family or your home or other property you might own or rent (or hope to buy or sell).</p>
<p>Additionally, you may be going through old photographs, learning about your ancestors, thinking about your childhood, or visiting relatives you’ve not seen in ages. If you do see elder relatives, ask questions about their lives, and perhaps get a few family recipes. As you see, you are in a long phase of focus on home and family, and as mentioned earlier, the new moon August 23 will emphasize this area of your life even more and allow you to make progress. (Mercury will retrograde from August 23 to September 15, so you will have to be patient.)</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mars, the action planet will move into Virgo on July 10 until August 27 and fill your fifth house of love with vibrant energy. I know—the universal is speaking in riddles here. Normally this would be a very romantic time, but Venus in retrograde will interfere with this period, particularly for singles. Venus only retrogrades every 18 months for approximately six weeks, so you don’t have frequent experience with Venus out of phase.</p>
<p>The ancient astrologers in the Greek Hellenistic period wrote a great deal about how the fifth house of love is also closely tied to children—conception, birth, care, and the enjoyment of them—so if you have children, you can plan some fun outings for them.</p>
<p>If you don’t have children (or even if you do), this same area of the chart is also closely tied to artistic expression, so you may go back to a project you had started but weren’t able to finish because life got in the way. Now you can find the time to devote to this important project and see impressive results. Mars will brighten your creative efforts from July 10 to August 27.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to another full moon which will arrive technically next month on August 1, to fall in Aquarius, 9 degrees. In the last three days of July, you will feel that full moon as it grows toward its crest. Until a full moon completely wanes, you will feel its effect for five days, until August 6.</p>
<p>This August 1 full moon might be quite exciting, for it will fall in Aquarius and light your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement. Something is coming to culmination in your professional standing in your company or the industry. If you have been awaiting news, it will come now, but it also could be good news that comes out of the blue. You may be starting a prestigious new job or finishing a project you’ve been working on for quite a long time—and now you may be showing it to the world.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>Things could go either way, but I feel the news is more likely to go in your favor at this full moon August 1. Uranus will be moving close to a trine with Pluto, and that is headline news. Although these two planets won’t hit exact until 2026-2028, for the first time since 1921-1922, by month’s end, Uranus and Pluto will be within significant mathematical aspect. They both are slow-moving planets, and that is why these two planets are already moving into significant mathematical range now.</p>
<p>You have Pluto in compatible Capricorn, your ninth house, which, as said earlier, rules international relationships and travel, higher education (college and beyond), publishing and broadcasting (including the media), and legal matters and the courts. Finally, this house rules spiritual, philosophical, and religious thinking—prayer, meditation, study to discover the meaning of life. One of these areas will become important to you in coming years.</p>
<p>Uranus is in Taurus, and Pluto is in Capricorn, and when working together, as they will be now and in the future, they can turn out to be powerful and fortunate for you—this aspect begins its first influence on you at month’s end.</p>
<p>One of the areas I listed will grow in importance as these two planets move through deep space to meet in a trine (heavenly) aspect. Remarkably, these two planets will meet in perfect aspect several times (2026-2028) before they part. Keep your antenna up, dear Taurus. This could be life changing.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Jupiter is now settled into Taurus, a privilege you have for the first time in 12 years. Jupiter will be working on expanding many of your opportunities and is set to bring you joy and happiness along the way.</p>
<p>This month the full moon in Capricorn will bring sensational news that will be “right up your ally,” such as an expansive trip abroad. The full moon, due July 3, could find you at the airport and living your best life in a carefree way that you’ve not experienced in months, or even years, prior to the pandemic.</p>
<p>This full moon is especially sweet because it will bring a highly supportive “sextile” (an aspect of great harmony) of the Sun to good-fortune Jupiter. Life is becoming full again, and you will be eager to join in. A friend seems to have a prominent part to play in all your luck at this full moon in Capricorn on July 3 and may offer you a place to stay, or may travel with you on your glorious adventure.</p>
<p>This same July 3 full moon could also bring very good news from the media, whether you are looking for a permanent or part-time job in the broadcasting, publishing, or digital arenas. Again, a friend may be the one who unlocks your opportunity. Another sweet spot has to do has to do with your efforts made toward gaining an advanced degree in an institution of higher education. If you are in college or graduate school, you will see that your efforts will soon pay off—you may get your first hint near July 3.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>The new moon in Cancer on July 17 will continue the strong emphasis on travel, only this time your destination would be a little closer to home. At the same time, just after July 17, you may be given papers to sign, but here you must be careful—with Venus about to go retrograde (July 22), a proposal that looks so good that you wonder if it can be true is probably a bad deal. Travel is the sweetest part of your chart this month, so indulge as much as you care to.</p>
<p>In matters of romance, Venus and Mars, a gorgeous duo that is said to set off the sparks of love when together, as they will be in the first half of July, will move through your home sector until July 10. If you are set on improving the look of your home, you will have beauty-oriented Venus and Mars working for you. If you want to give a party or a romantic dinner for “just us two” that you whip up in the kitchen at home, you could not wish for a better time to do so than early July.</p>
<p>You notice I said early July. There’s a reason to stay away from the end of July: Venus will go retrograde from July 22 to September 3.</p>
<p>Venus retrograde is not a time to begin dating or to do anything to improve your looks. That means stick to the status quo—no Botox, fillers or face lifts, or veneers on your teeth, and do not ask your stylist for a radical new hair style. Venus governs love and appearance, and when Venus is retrograde, things in this area tend to go haywire. This is especially true for you, for as a Taurus, Venus in your ruler. You would do well to sit through this period and not make any major initiations in business (Venus is associated with money, luxury, and profits, too), matters of love, or appearance.</p>




        <h2>Your July Horoscope for Taurus</h2>
        <p>There is some indication you might be moving to a new city, region, or country to take advantage of a career offer, and if so, look at the start of July when your options will be best. You may be looking to buy, sell, rent, renovate, or redecorate. Alternatively, if you need to move, you may focus on the well-being of a certain extended family member or of your immediate family.</p>
<p>Home and family will get a big positive boost after the new moon arrives on July 17. This time, Uranus will be sending gifts, so if you get an opportunity, you will have to be decisive or see your chance to move ahead evaporate as quickly as it came up.</p>
<p>The August 1 full moon will bring a career matter to culmination, and it might be quite exciting. It looks as though your star is on the rise and that your name will be on many lips in your industry. If negotiating for an increase in salary, you may not get all the salary you asked for—your increase might come later, after you establish yourself at the firm.</p>
<p>Uranus is the planet that will decide the outcome, and it looks like you’ll be happy, with a surprise twist along the way. If you are not interviewing, then a project you are involved in could be high profile and bring you the kind of attention you’ve been craving.</p>
<p>If you have been interviewing for an important new professional position of authority, it appears to be quite a prestigious one. You will know if you won the job within five days of the full moon on August 1.</p>
<p>Go for it—it seems to have your name on it!</p>
