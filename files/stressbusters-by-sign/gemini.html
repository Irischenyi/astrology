	    	<p><span class="text">When crisis hits, the first thing a Gemini does is pick up the phone and a call a trusted friend. This is the perfect reaction, for reaching out and listening to get an objective observer&#8217;s opinion will offer air sign Gemini another person&#8217;s perspective, a fresh insight or two and new information they may not have considered. Highly cerebral and analytical, Mercury-ruled Gemini likes to see all sides of their situation to feel that they have thought of all possible options. Simply by relating what is wrong, Gemini sees the parameters of their situation better than if they had remained silent.</span></p>
<p class="text">Do keep in mind that with all this relating to others, you could get confused or overwhelmed with all the varying responses you get. Eventually you will have to draw the line and come to closure. Sometimes Gemini procrastinates, so ask yourself why you&#8217;re holding out and if there is something troubling you about the situation. Ferret out whatever is preventing you from proceeding with your usual vigor and enthusiasm. Your mutable quality makes you highly flexible and adaptable, a real asset in times of change.</p>
<p class="text">If possible, get a change of scene by going away for a few days. Getting over a breakup, deciding on a career switch, figuring out how to pay too many bills&#8211;any problem will to find a quicker solution when a Gemini is away from home and not distracted by everyday duties. The trip need not be to a distant place&#8211;a nearby city would do&#8211;but it has to offer enough stimulus to keep high-IQ Gemini busy and entertained. Therefore, don&#8217;t go to a deserted beach or quiet village. Rather, choose a place where you could take in a few cultural things during the day and reconnect with old friends over dinner. Nothing rejuvenates a Gemini from stress like a trip, even a weekend getaway, as long it is to a place that is either new or a place they haven&#8217;t seen in a while. (Same-old, same-old is not going to relax Gemini.)</p>
<p class="text">Gemini is the sign that rules sisters, brothers and cousins, and often Gemini is close to one of these relatives. (Think of John F. Kennedy&#8211;who was a very typical Gemini&#8211;and his close relationship with his brother, Robert.) If you have a sibling or cousin who has always given you good advice while you were growing up, seeing them again now could be comforting. The break in routine will refresh you, and getting an opinion from a relative who knows you well and who loves you could do much to steady your nerves.</p>
<p class="text">If you can&#8217;t find the time (or the money) to go away, taking a long walk or drive in the country would be the next best idea, for Gemini also rules the neighborhood. For sports, try riding a bike, or going rollerblading&#8211; any sport which would get you outdoors. (Being stuck inside a gym, going through a routine you&#8217;ve done hundreds of times before, will not help you to relax. Anything rote is to be avoided now.)</p>
<p class="text">Gemini rules the written word, so keeping a journal or pouring your energy into creative writing is an excellent idea. (As they say, all smart writers use their own distress as fodder for great fiction!)</p>
<p class="text">Most people feel more relaxed in places that have happy associations. Being surrounded by new beautiful books is Gemini&#8217;s equivalent of a puppy in clover, so get to a bookstore! First, read the reviews, find one book which sounds good. Once at the store, you could also look up material on whatever is causing you grief. Since Gemini loves self-help books, so scan that section, or choose a fast-paced bestseller to engross you (your sign also rules current titles). Walk over to the magazine section and review the foreign publications&#8211;if you remember your high school French, German or Spanish, pick up a foreign publication, or perhaps a British magazine will appeal to you. The point is to vary your routine and break molds. Gemini needs a free exchange of ideas as dearly as air to breathe.</p>
<p class="text">Gemini rules the lungs, so be sure you don&#8217;t start smoking again. The lungs are often this sign&#8217;s weakest link, so Gemini must be sure to protect them. (A social sign, many Gemini begin to smoke because their friends do, and then find they can&#8217;t stop. A doctor may have several methods to help, if this is the case for you.) Another part of the body sensitive to stress is, oddly enough, Gemini&#8217;s fingers, for their ruling planet, Mercury, rules their hands. While this gives Gemini great dexterity in their fingers, they tend to overuse them. A warm paraffin wax and cream manicure, or, a slow, 20-minute hand massage would be heaven, especially if you are a writer, editor, or spend lots of time on the computer, something communication-oriented Gemini is prone to do.</p>
<p class="text">Lastly, Gemini is known to have lots of hobbies and interests. Picking up an old pastime that you haven&#8217;t done in a while would give you lots of pleasure. Or, think of a new hobby. Remember Demi Moore in Ghost? She did more for the pottery industry than anyone in the history of time. Wow, did dipping her hands in wet clay look sexy, sensuous, and ultra-creative. (If you have a hunk like Patrick Swayze around the house to be the recipient of your newest plates and pots&#8211;so much the better!) The point is try something to take your mind off the hamster wheel. Then, abracadabra, sure as mud, your subconscious will come up with a solution when you least expect it . After all, Gemini, you practically invented doing two things at once!</p>
