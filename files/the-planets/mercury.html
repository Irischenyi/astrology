	    	<p class="text">This little guy is the mythological messenger, communicating information to one and all. Mercury represents non-emotional, highly rational, objective thought. Its placement in a sign determines that sign&#8217;s intellectual style. As a quickly moving planet, Mercury is flexible, responsive and adaptable. A big part of Mercury&#8217;s job is to disburse information; as such it rules perception, language, writing, editing, research, speaking, all kinds of learning experiences and learning styles and the assessment of data. It rules telecommunications, computing, software, electronic gadgets, the postal service, shipping, couriers, and all forms of transportation. This planet has a LOT of responsibility.</p>
<p class="text">When Mercury retrogrades (something you will read about often on my website, Astrology Zone, at www.astologyzone.com), it scrambles information, causes static and confusion. Its effects are felt universally. Mercury retrograde episodes are highly unreliable to sign contracts, complete important transactions, access accurate information or make big decisions.</p>
<p class="text">The sign and house in which Mercury resides in one&#8217;s chart reveals a great deal about that person&#8217;s natural style of gathering and giving out information. Mercury also rules sibling relationships, maps, letters, travel plans, appointments, roadways, vehicles, advertising, publishing, sales, and public relations.</p>
<p class="text">Mercury rules both Gemini and Virgo. Mercury spends about two-three weeks in each sign, but when it retrogrades, which it does three to four times a year, it can stay in one sign as long as ten weeks. Never far from the Sun, it takes about one year to circle the zodiac.</p>
