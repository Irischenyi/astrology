	    	<p class="text">The Taurus man loves creature comforts. He is sensuous, tactile, giving, practical and stable. When a Taurus man falls in love it is forever, because Taurus guys aren&#8217;t wanderers. One of the sexiest characteristics of a Taurus man is his wonderfully sexy, deep voice. Taurus rules the throat, and many Taurus are well known singers.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Your Challenge</span></p>
<p>Taurus men often settle into ruts and aren&#8217;t known to be too flexible. You&#8217;ll want to coax him into trying sharing new experiences and considering your point of view at decision-making time. Some Tauruses can be very jealous of anyone else you may be dating, so you&#8217;ll have to keep an eye out for that too.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">How To Handle Him</span></p>
<p>When this man says, &#8220;Be mine!&#8221; he means it quite literally, for this is a possessive sign. While this may seem charming on the outset, it can get a bit annoying. Deal with this by being a little flirtatious around other guys, but not to the extent that he thinks you would really dump him for someone else. Just tease him a little and reassure him that he is your number one man, and his passion will burn even brighter for you. Feeling secure is important to Taurus, and most of their decisions are based upon how he can increase this feeling. Taurus likes routine (hard to believe anyone does, but it is true.) While he is not a sign known for flexibility, his steadfastness and reliability will more than compensate, and you will find it comforting. So, don&#8217;t expect your Taurus lover to understand when plans change at the last minute. He has difficulty turning on a dime and this is something you will simply have to accept. And if you want to have any influence his thinking, be sure to get your ideas across in early during his long decision-making process, before he becomes &#8220;set.&#8221; Taurus can be quite stubborn!</p>

<p>Taurus men love the arts, so a Saturday spent poking through art galleries in Soho with a grand dinner at a fine restaurant later would be a perfect day. (Taurus can quite a gourmet, so make the restaurant special.) Taurus is a sensuous and cultured sign, so everything you do should be carefully and subtly orchestrated for the ultimate seduction.</p>
<p class="text">When making love, remember to stimulate all his senses. Start by surprising him with some special imported dark or white chocolate&#8211;Taurus men adore chocolate!&#8211;to nibble while consuming their other favorite treat, superb champagne. Other things to have on hand include: dozens of votive candles, a short, silk charmeuse slip for you in a maddeningly flattering color, such as a pale peach (wear nothing underneath), a jar of warm, satiny cream to rub his shoulders and chest with (the areas Taurus men have the most tension), and his favorite CDs on the stereo. (Surprise him with one or two new titles, too.) Wrap up a new designer men&#8217;s cologne and tuck it under his pillow&#8211;tell him how much this scent turned you on while you were in Saks Fifth Avenue and how it made you ache to be with him. Now, your seduction is all set. Happily, Taurus men don&#8217;t like to rush anything they do, so you&#8217;re assured that he is yours for that evening! Lucky girl, Taurus is one sign that thoroughly enjoys languorous lovemaking.</p>
