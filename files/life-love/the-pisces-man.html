	    	<p><span class="text">This man&#8217;s vivid imagination and sensitivity (matched in intensity only by fellow water sign Cancer) will endear him to you quickly. Pisces&#8217; greatest strength is their creativity. <a class="small" href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-planets/neptune/">Neptune</a>Â makes them brilliant at expressing themselves in symbols and gestures. They therefore they make outstanding film makers, photographers, and dancers. Their empathetic nature will make you fall in love with him quickly, for it is possible you&#8217;ve never met a man who knows the inner you so well.</span></p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Your Challenge</span></p>
<p>Pisces sometimes loses himself in his work, especially if he&#8217;s in a creative field. He needs a regular outlet to express his powerful emotions and insights on the world, so you will have to learn to be supportive of his efforts. At times he can be hard to pin down, but this is usually due to his not yet having made up his mind about an issue. Being a dual sign like Gemini, he likes to look at both sides of every situation before taking a stand.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">How To Handle Him</span></p>
<p>When trying to persuade a Pisces man of anything, do not use facts or logic; appeal to his emotions and intuition. If you press any point too hard or become demanding, he will swim in the other direction. He is gentle to others and expects to be treated in kind. He hates ruts and constricting routines, so a free-form schedule in life is more to his liking.</p>
<p class="text">Another important fact to remember is that Pisces will give freely of himself whenever he can, but if he feels he has been taken advantage of, he will retreat without warning. At that point, it is hard to win back his trust. The Pisces man needs to be appreciated.</p>
<p class="text">This man is not materialistic or money-oriented&#8211;don&#8217;t bug him to ask for a raise or question why he doesn&#8217;t make more money. He realizes that possessions and money are only earth-bound, temporal things that don&#8217;t matter much in the grand scheme. He is too spiritual to be concerned with such mundane matters. A deeply philosophical sign, money does not motivate him as much as self-expression and creativity do. (Money does have a way of finding a way to Pisces, nevertheless, so don&#8217;t think this is a sign doomed to poverty!)</p>
<p class="text">Since Pisces reads body language better than any other sign, don&#8217;t be surprised if he just seems to know much more about you than you&#8217;ve ever told him. Of course, verbal communication is important too, but keep it delicate and poetic. When delivering criticism to him be diplomatic rather than direct. Pisces men never like anything too gritty and hard-hitting.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy</span></p>
<p>An ideal evening to a Pisces man would be to have dinner in an exotic Indian or Asian restaurant, and have a double espresso afterwards in a tiny, dark patisserie, debating a particular moral or ethical issue until the sun comes up. Or take him to the movies&#8211;he can&#8217;t seem to see enough of them.</p>
<p class="text">Since Pisces rules the feet, why not delight your man by surprising him with some special peppermint foot cream and a relaxing foot massage? Their feet are the first area of their body to show signs of stress. Now, the Pisces man&#8217;s first instinct is to pay attention to you first, so he will have to get used you lavishing attention of him. Be sure to tell him just looking at his body is a wonderful turn-on for you; the Pisces man has less vanity than most signs and may be surprised to hear you say this! Although he may not appear to need it, if you bolster his self-confidence in the bedroom he will turn into a dream lover for you!</p>
<p class="text">A lush tropical island resort would be the perfect locale to seduce your Pisces beloved because he will feel refreshed and uninhibited near bodies of water. On the appointed day, tell him you&#8217;ve packed a picnic lunch and drive him out to the prettiest waterfall you can find on the island (do your research first). Bring along your Polaroid camera (Pisces rules photography) to capture some of the fun. Wearing only a thin T-shirt and string bikini bottom, dare him to follow as you run under the falls. Let yourself become totally drenched, hair and all. Do all this quickly to capture the element of surprise and allow him a moment or two to stare at you in your clingy, now see-though T and skimpy bottom, laughing and beckoning him to join you. Do you honestly not know how this scene ends?</p>
