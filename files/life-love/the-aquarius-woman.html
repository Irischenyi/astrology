<h1>the-aquarius-woman<h1>

	    	<p><span class="text">The Aquarius woman is smart, independent, somewhat rebellious and a true original. Part of the reason her man has fallen in love with her is the fact that she&#8217;s not a clinging vine. Quite the contrary, she matches wits with her man, has a wide circle of her own friends, and prefers to stand on her own two feet. Many Aquarius women are leaders in their field. She&#8217;s analytical and her ability to communicate is highly developed. If you want to get on her good side, use reason and logic rather than emotion.</span></p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Your Challenge</span></p>
<p>Your challenge will be to keep things from becoming boring or routine, which would spell disaster for your relationship. She is not an easy little bird to catch, for once you feel you&#8217;ve got her in your hands (or arms) she&#8217;s flitted away again. She will need her space, and with so many other guys buzzing around her (she tells you they&#8217;re just friends) you will need to steady your nerves.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy</span></p>
<p>Her best colors are bright fuchsia, cobalt blue or charcoal gray. Aquarius women tend to wear streamlined, futuristic clothing and some Aquarius women don&#8217;t mind if they shock a bit. Her taste in jewelry is unique and individual, even New Age, so you could do well by getting her a special crystal. There is a uniqueness about the Aquarius woman, from her toes to her hair, she is always a bit different, on the cutting edge of what&#8217;s new and hot.</p>
<p class="text">Another gift that would be a hit is a beeper with voice mail capability, all the better for you to leave her intimate love messages. If you take her out to eat, better ask ahead of she likes a certain kind of food, for many Aquarians are vegetarians. She does not need to be wined and dined in a five-star restaurant&#8211;she is just as happy in a noisy, lively bistro that serves good food and is a place where she might bump into friends. (To get an Aquarius alone is a feat unto itself.)</p>
<p class="text">Never inhibited in bed, Aquarius brings a sense of fun and playfulness to her lovemaking. She may suggest a video to watch beforehand, since Aquarius are so electronically-oriented, or if you know her very well, she might consent to making your private video together, with her ground rules. Since she loves being in the center of the action, tell her that you want make love to her in a semi-public place. Remember the movie set in Vietnam, called The Lover? The lovers meet regularly in an apartment right off the street where city noises and people walking around outside the door are quite audible, and the very closeness of the street has an erotic effect on lovers. Be inspired by this thought, perhaps at the next party you two attend. Choose a room where she can hear other guests but where the two of you can temporarily disappear for some privacy, maybe a closet or pantry. Don&#8217;t worry about her reaction to suggesting a quickie&#8211;if she knows you well, this is one lady who will be delighted!</p>
