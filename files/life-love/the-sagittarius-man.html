	    	<p><span class="text">Your Sagittarius guy has a strong intellect, penetrating thought process and continual curiosity about the world around him. Your man is ready for a deep discussion on ethics, morality, politics, philosophy, or religion, so go ahead one night and tackle The Meaning Of Life. Unlike Gemini, who focuses on details of the here and now, Sagittarius looks at the entire sweep of collected knowledge and tries to make sense out of the big picture. His most attractive qualities are his faith and optimism, and his customary cheer will endear him to you. This sign also has major wanderlust, so pack your glacier glasses and bug spray if you want to travel with him on his jaunts to the most exotic locales. Finally, this is the sign of the ultimate jock. Many of our most gifted Olympians are born under this sign and he will require lots of physical activity. If he sounds like a handful, it&#8217;s because he is, but such an interesting handful!</span></p>
<p><span class="subtitle">Your Challenge</span><span class="text"></p>
<p>Your Sagittarius man likes the bachelor life more than most signs, so getting him to commit may take some doing. Freedom is something he values enormously and it&#8217;s crucial for him to be able to do what he wants to do.</span></p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">How To Handle Him</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mens sanis in corpore Sagittarius&#8221; Sag has so much energy he will need some sort of regular exercise to keep him from going completely mental. If he needs to spend what you believe to be inordinate amounts of time at the gym, don&#8217;t hassle him&#8211; humor him instead. (You won&#8217;t be able to win this one anyway). Enjoy his beautiful shoulders and abs and glutes and tell him he looks just like the Diet Coke man.</p>
<p class="text">Sag is great because they always tell the truth, but sometimes hearing unvarnished truth can be rough on the rest of us. They have no sense of diplomacy, so if you ask their opinion, be ready to hear it! In love, Sag needs lots of sex and sports but he has an equal need for an intellectual partner. He will want his woman to stay up to date on political issues and trends and he will enjoy lively and even heated debates. If he needs regular nights out with the boys, say &#8220;fine.&#8221; Nothing spoils a relationship faster for a Sag than a sense of claustrophobia.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy</span></p>
<p>Equipment for his favorite sport or new workout clothing would be good, and if you are feeling generous, a membership to a health club would be ideal (that would be a subtle acknowledgment of his manly physical prowess). This sign adores animals too, so you could surprise him with that pet Dalmatian puppy he wants.</p>
<p class="text">Sagittarius is a sophisticated sign that enjoys international cuisine. When taking him to dinner read the reviews and find an unusual restaurant such as one that serves Vietnamese, Japanese, Turkish, or Thai cuisine. Afterwards, continue the international theme by going to a foreign flick. Often guys from this sign are good with languages and at the very least enjoy a good debate, so chose a movie with a substantial plot (no, The Bodyguard won&#8217;t quite cut it.) This sign loves sports, as participant rather than a spectator. Suggest you go swimming, play tennis or do any sport where you can keep up your end fairly well. His ego is not fragile, this guy doesn&#8217;t want you to let him win for he enjoys and admires strong women. So give him a real workout on the courts and you&#8217;ll both win!</p>
<p class="text">The more things you do in the great outdoors, the better, for he likes to be in expansive space. You know where this is all leading in terms of your seduction&#8211;your Sagittarius lover would be thrilled if you suggested making love al fresco. This could be a problem if you are moved to do this in winter and live in a freezing region of the country. Since Sag is the sign of the centaur, chances are he likes horseback riding, so how about seducing him in the barn on top of an old-fashioned hay stack? Start by telling him how perfect his riding &#8220;seat&#8221; is and how you couldn&#8217;t get your eyes off him. Since Sagittarius is the sign ruling the thighs, gently stroking him there will drive him wild with desire. If the weather is warmer, seduce him out in the wide open spaces, in a private, lush and green setting, under the full moon and stars. Can you think of anything more romantic?</p>
