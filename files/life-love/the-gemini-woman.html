<h1>the-gemini-woman<h1>

	    	<p><span class="text">The Gemini woman is full of enthusiasm. A vivacious, shining beauty, she can talk about a wide variety of subjects, and she is curious about everything. Don&#8217;t advise a Gemini woman that she would be better off doing one thing at a time, for she needs variety and pursues a multitude of interests. She is actually at her best when swamped with things to do! Gemini is an ace communicator too, particularly adept at sharing her emotions and thoughts. (Take away her dial tone and it is like taking away oxygen.) She doesn&#8217;t go for a man who crowds her or who limits her space. Gemini is symbolized by the twins flying through the air, and to set limits on a Gemini is like trapping a lovely bird in a small cage.</span></p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Your Challenge</span></p>
<p>This is a busy woman with endless lists of things to accomplish. She does have a tendency to be a bit forgetful too. But who wouldn&#8217;t, with her lifestyle? She does more in a week than most of us accomplish in a month! You will need to remain Priority One with her, a hard task, when you&#8217;re competing with all her activities, friends and admirers.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">How To Handle Her</span></p>
<p>Read up on current issues, whether it is art, technology, movies, or books&#8211;anything interesting you that is topical. Then suggest to her that you and she check out a show or meet in a late night coffee shop to discuss the issues. Gemini adores a lively debate (she was probably captain of her debating team in college). Browse with her in a good bookstore, one that plays music to encourage lingering. (Gemini rules the printed words, thus, she is happy in book shops.) Or, if she has a new laptop, offer to help her set up her system folder. (She has the brains to do it, but prefers to do things like that Å¡ deux for the company.) Suggest you go window shopping for a new fax machine one night after work, so that she can choose the best one when she&#8217;s ready. Convince her to let you assess the various local cellular phone carriers to choose the best deal for her, then meet to discuss your findings. As you see all these things are communication-oriented, and believe it or not, as dorky as these things seem, they will really turn her on. She will love you for your thoughtfulness. Trust me on this.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy</span></p>
<p>Buy her a cellular phone or a beeper with voice mail messaging, with pre-paid service for a year so you can call her up and leave sexy messages. Or give her an all-expense-paid-trip for two (with you!) to an inland hideaway. (Be sure there are cultural activities and night life available&#8211;remember, Gemini needs lots of stimulation). No money? Then fax her a naughty love note if her machine is private or else FedEx her an overnight letter filled with pink and red rose petals&#8211;she will be thrilled by your creativity.</p>
<p class="text">In bed, whisper words and little stories you&#8217;ve imagined or read. She is the most verbal of all the signs, and her strong intellect and rich imagination is your surest way to passionate love. Read portions of steamy novels too while in bed, and don&#8217;t be afraid to laugh or have fun with her when making love. She is one of the most spontaneous of all the signs. Since Gemini is the sign which rules versatility, she will appreciate your reading up on different lovemaking positions&#8211;and she&#8217;ll be willing to try almost anything at least once. One more hint: she is very verbal, and therefore highly oral. Enough said? You lucky dude, you.</p>
