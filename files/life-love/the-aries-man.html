	    	<p><span class="text">Are you in love with an Aries man? You&#8217;ve got quite a macho man on your hands! Ruled by <a class="small" href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-planets/mars/">Mars</a>, the hot, red, active planet, the Aries man is known as the &#8220;warrior.&#8221; Fearless and brave, active and entrepreneurial, he is eager for new experiences. Your man is never ever boring!</span></p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Your Challenge</span><br />
To get his attention away from his constant business wheelings and dealings, and to cater to his substantial physical needs.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">How To Handle Him</span><br />
If this is your first date with an Aries, choose something daring to do. Aries, the lover of risk and adventure, is apt to enjoy activities with you that could include hang gliding, bungee jumping or car racing. The Aries man&#8217;s credo is he&#8217;ll try anything once. Use this to turn his mind away from everyday business matters and focus on you.</p>
<p class="text">Being such a testosterone-charged and masculine sign, Aries needs a regular, highly active sex life. He is apt to be aggressive and spontaneous, and this is one man who likes to take the lead. At the same time, the Aries man is highly protective of his lover, being quite willing to fight (literally or figuratively) for her, and this is a big part of his appeal. Be gentle with this ego, though. If you&#8217;re not &#8220;in the mood&#8221; he might take the slightest rejection quite hard.</p>
<p class="text">Aries likes a challenge, so you could tease him a bit when he starts getting bossy, keeping what he wants out of reach until the end of the pursuit. If trying to win an argument, the smart partner of an Aries man will subtly convince him that her ideas are really his ideas. Some Aries men have a roving eye, which is not an attractive quality, so to keep him playing in his own back yard, keep your body sleek, your lingerie sexy (a few skimpy pieces in his favorite color, red, would be a good idea) and the lights low (candlelight is perfect&#8211;Aries rules fire). Most of all, keep him guessing because he loves the thrill of the chase.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy</span><br />
Want to surprise him? Cook him a spicy dinner, perhaps something Tex Mex&#8211;or&#8211;just tease him by putting a jalapeno pepper in your mouth and dare him to bite it gently (a la 9 1/2 Weeks). Then alternate sweet flavors with spicy (Aries rules spicy flavors). That&#8217;s a way to get his attention!</p>
<p class="text">In terms of gifts, the Aries man likes an experience rather than something tangible. You might buy tickets to a boxing match or an exciting basketball game where he can get all worked up and scream his lungs out&#8211;all the better to get his lusty self in bed later that evening.</p>
