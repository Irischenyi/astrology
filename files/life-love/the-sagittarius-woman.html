<h1>the-sagittarius-woman<h1>

	    	<p><span class="text">The Sagittarius woman is vivacious, funny, self assured, and sophisticated. She probably had an opportunity to travel as a child, and will need to continue to do so throughout her life. She&#8217;s a woman who needs challenge and intellectual stimulation in all parts of her life.</span></p>
<p class="text">Sag women are often highly successful at what they set out to do simply because they are so positive they will succeed. Since the sign also rules international communication, they are either known worldwide or deal with matters of global importance. This is not an overly-sensitive sign, and when criticized, they listen carefully to the feedback. She should be careful not to hurt her mate&#8217;s feelings by being too direct in her comments; Sag often has no idea of how her words effect others. Her man should also be sure to allow her a sense of freedom which is highly important to the Sag woman.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Your Challenge</span></p>
<p>To keep her intellectually stimulated will be a lifelong struggle. This is no dumb bunny, and you may have to struggle to keep up with her. (Her idea of fun is listening to National Public Radio.) She gets bored easily, so be forewarned!</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">How To Handle Her</span></p>
<p>Her sign rules the centaur, half man, half horse, pointing high, toward the sky, which symbolizes her quest to reach the lofty goals she&#8217;s set. She could be &#8220;high maintenance&#8221; in that you will have to endure all the highs and lows of her existence, for her motto is nothing ventured, nothing gained. Alas, some things just aren&#8217;t going too work out, but unlike Cancer, who will try to second-guess themselves, Sag&#8217;s optimism will buoy her up. She will be on to Plan B in no time. Sometimes this could be exhausting for you, so keep the vitamins handy. Places To Go, Things To Buy Her</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to get her a fragrance, choose one of the fresh new uni-sex fragrance, for she won&#8217;t wear anything too conventionally flowery or sweet. She is apt to be a runner or do some equally strenuous sport&#8211;can you imagine a marathon runner fussing with Arpege? Not quite.</p>
<p class="text">Her likes her look sporty, preferring pants to skirts and sportswear to anything more formal. Sag generally likes comfortable shoes, the heels not too high. It must have been a Sag who started the trend of wearing her sneakers on the way to work. Often Sag women were tomboys as a kid, and as a woman she manages to keep her enviable figure because of all the exercise she gets. Give her clothing which is body revealing, such as a mini skirt and matching top in lycra or spandex. She is one woman who can carry it off in style! Or treat her to ten weeks with a personal trainer and she&#8217;ll be yours for life.</p>
<p class="text">The Sag woman has no patience with frilly nightgowns but prefers either something plain and natural. What would she most likely wear to bed? A cool, thin, tight white cotton tank top which outlines her breasts, worn with tiny cotton string panties&#8211;or nothing at all. She likes men&#8217;s wear, so you might catch her putting on your button-down shirt with not much else on but a smile. (Remember how fetching Annette Bening looked in the seduction scene from American President?). She will do more for your shirt than you could ever imagine.</p>
<p class="text">She will be impressed if you treat your body like a temple too, so try to work out often. Then, you can lounge around in tight bicycle shorts to heat things up. Look at her innocently and say you took a part time job as a messenger and need to wear them for practicality and comfort. (She&#8217;d got a good sense of humor.) Since this woman would love a strenuous workout, plan an active, feather-flying pillow fight or try chasing her around the yard. Feeling randy? Toss her into a snow drift. The aim here is to get her pulse rate up then convince her she won&#8217;t need her morning run with you around.</p>
