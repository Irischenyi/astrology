<h1>the-taurus-woman<h1>

	    	<p><span class="text">The Taurus woman is feminine, soft and highly diplomatic. She has a lyrical speaking voice that soothes and comforts you, and she could even have a talented singing voice (Barbara Streisand is a Taurus). Ruled by <a class="small" href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-planets/venus/">Venus</a>, Taurus is a sign which adores the arts&#8211;from music to painting&#8211;and will enthusiastically go to any cultural event her lover suggests. In lovemaking, the Taurus woman is passionate and deeply tender. She may not be as sexually experimental as the other signs, but her fidelity and strong sense of ethics will impress you. Her bed will be the pinnacle of comfort, with piles of pillows and a fluffy comforter. There might be fresh flowers in her bedroom, or she might have a glass wall overlooking a lush garden. She will make her environment so inviting you won&#8217;t want to leave, for Taurus adores comfort.</span></p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Your Challenge</span></p>
<p>Your Taurus woman will need to see tangible evidence of your love for her&#8211;and that means gifts. There is no getting around this and you may have to save up to afford her! She is one of the most loving and affectionate of all signs, certainly one of the most sensuous, and quite a catch. But first, this lady will want to know that you have a nest egg. Delay popping the question until you can show her your substantial stash of Treasury bills, a solid investment in mutual funds, an impressive stock portfolio and, of course, cash in the bank. Being a earth sign, having some real estate wouldn&#8217;t hurt either&#8211;it is something which would impress her deeply. (I never said your courtship was going to be easy, did I?)</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">How To Handle Her</span></p>
<p>Assure her of your reliability and your stability&#8211;traits she values in a person. Being flaky is the surest way to turn her off. She is slow but sure in matters of the heart, so don&#8217;t rush her. Treat her well and she&#8217;ll be yours for a long, long time.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Things To Do, Gifts Buy</span></p>
<p>Always keep in mind that she is ruled by Venus, the planet of decorative arts. Start by sending her flowers. Be prepared to plunk down major money for a large bouquet of rare blooms. Don&#8217;t try to get away with something cheap and small&#8211;you&#8217;ll loose points. Original flowers to try would be white and purple lilacs, which are as fragrant as they are beautiful, and send them to her in an expensive crystal vase. (A Taurus knows quality when she sees it, and she adores objects of beauty. Every time she uses the vase you gave her, she will think of you.)</p>
<p class="text">Another clever tactic would be to find out the name of her favorite scent. Most Taurus women have an entire arsenal of perfumes, one to suit every mood, and she uses her stash to seduce her chosen male with skill and subtlety. Taurus rules the throat, so a choker of pearls or other stones would go over well too. Princess Di has popularized the choker. This was not surprising since she had Venus in Taurus. This sign likes almost any kind of gem, as long as it is precious and refined, so certainly there must be something that strikes your eye at the jeweler&#8217;s. If you can&#8217;t afford to get her jewelry, then try for a fine silk or cashmere scarf. She is prone to sore throats and you&#8217;ll want to be sure she stays cozy warm in the winter.</p>
<p class="text">Finally, the influence of Venus gives the Taurus woman a rounded silhouette, perfect &#8220;material&#8221; for a WonderBra. If you know her well, by all means buy her a selection of this type of bra in various pretty colors, then talk her into giving you a fashion s how. Since the media keeps telling women who have curves (as most Taurus women do) that they are less-than-ideal, you&#8217;ll need to counteract that notion. Keep reassuring her that you adore her real-woman curves and that the waif look was never one that turned you on.</p>
