<h1>the-pisces-woman<h1>

	    	<p class="text">The Pisces temperament is gentle, romantic, caring, compassionate, and spiritual. Pisces rules the subconscious mind, and so it follows that her dreams are vivid and meaningful, even prophetic. You&#8217;ve got quite a glamorous sparkler on your hands&#8211;Elizabeth Taylor, Sharon Stone and Cindy Crawford are all dazzling Pisces, and each in their own way reflects the reserved and unpretentious Pisces nature. Your Pisces enchantress almost always has large and beautiful eyes which mirror her feelings openly and she could be prone to cry easily. Soft and ultra-feminine, she will put your needs ahead of hers.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Your Challenge</span></p>
<p>Her feelings are very sensitive and easily hurt, so be careful how you address her. In any relationship, she likes to proceed gradually, perhaps at a slower pace than you would like. But rush her and your little fish will disappear into the depths of the sea.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">How To Handle Her</span></p>
<p>She&#8217;s mystical and poetic and she needs a regular outlet for her creative expressions. Her sign rules all non-verbal communication&#8211;symbols, gesture, dance, art, and poetry&#8211;and the Pisces woman is highly intuitive. She trusts her feelings and she reads body language perfectly, so don&#8217;t try to say one thing and mean another&#8211;she will catch on quickly. Pisces will need to be alone occasionally to recharge and refresh herself, so allow her time for that.</p>
<p class="text">She&#8217;s caring and sensitive to her man, but can easily be so self-effacing that she forgets her own needs. Her urge to relieve suffering in others is as strong as the life force and it is the single most important element of her nature to understand. Some people will sometimes take advantage of her good nature. Her man should help her by reminding her that it&#8217;s OK to say no to favors others ask of her. At times the world can have a wearing-down effect on her self-confidence, which sometimes needs rebuilding in even the strongest Pisces women. When Pisces is hurt, she will build her own version of the world to protect herself, preferring to live in a world of dreams until she feels she is ready for re-entry into reality. Realize this is not a weakness&#8211;she will always come back&#8211;and the worst thing you could say to this fragile beauty is &#8220;Get real!&#8221;</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy</span></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be overtly sexual with Pisces&#8211;she is subtle and indirect. Come across brash and aggressive and she&#8217;ll vanish. Instead, give her a book of romantic poetry, like that of Edna St. Vincent Millay or a beautiful black &amp; white photograph of a couple kissing. Or give her music, perhaps something soothing and spiritual, such as Enya, Orion or Monks singing Gregorian chant.</p>
<p class="text">Buy her clothing in one of her favorite shades of violet, blue or sea green. She loves lace, angora sweaters, and prefers flowing, soft chiffon-type fabrics over sharp tailoring. Silk is favored over crisp cotton. Sparkling jewels look especially beautiful on her, so consider surprising her with diamonds, amethysts or aquamarine stones. In choosing a restaurant, pick a dark, private, romantic place filled with flowers. She loves to dance (Pisces rules the feet) so take her to a club with a great band. She also loves the movies, for her ruler, Neptune, rules film and she can easily lose herself in the story. She will also adore tickets to the ballet, an art opening or a poetry reading. Finally, surprise her a deluxe shower head for her bathroom (Pisces is a water sign), promising her that the two of you will play under it soon.</p>
<p class="text">Sex to Pisces is spiritual. She simply cannot sleep with a man she isn&#8217;t in love with. She&#8217;s worth waiting for&#8211;her natural sense of rhythm and grace in body movement makes her a fabulous lover. This does not preclude her from having fun with her lover&#8211;that is a certainty&#8211;but she will need a full commitment of love from you before surrendering.</p>
<p class="text">No other sign loves costume and fantasy as much as Pisces does, so when you get to know her well, suggest you both go shopping together for an outfit to wear in the bedroom&#8211;a French maid? Cleopatra? Elvira, Mistress of the Dark? Her rich imagination needs fantasy, so you will be on the right track. If she is a reserved Pisces, give her a gift-wrapped bottle of her favorite scent tucked inside the pocket of a new luxurious terry robe. She&#8217;ll be happy to try her new robe on&#8211;just tell her the rules are that she wear nothing else. Then draw her close to you, turn on the water in the bath and take a long, passionate and steamy soak together. Afterwards, be sure to rub on some of the softy scented cream that you bought and let nature take its course!</p>
