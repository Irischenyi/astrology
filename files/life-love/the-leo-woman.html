	    	<p><span class="text">A Leo woman is easy to spot. She&#8217;s the one lighting up the room in her spectacular designer outfit&#8211;Leo women love to make an entrance. Her taste is superb and unfailing. Like chic French women (France is ruled by Leo), a lioness would rather have one dazzling outfit than 20 cheap ones. She has a deep and abiding need for respect from others and will work hard to being noticed and remembered. She is naturally extravagant&#8211;don&#8217;t even try to tell her she spends too much on clothes (or on her kids either, who she loves to pamper). Yet she is warm, spontaneous and creative too, and you are sure to have fun with this vivacious lioness.</span></p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Your Challenge</span></p>
<p>In a nutshell, your challenge will be to afford this jewel of a woman. Her taste is superb and she won&#8217;t settle for second best (which she translates as second rate). She will be demanding, so be prepared to lavish lots of attention on her instead of being preoccupied with your spreadsheets or waxing your car. If you are serious about her, bite the bullet and get some personal help. You will need to maximize your efficiency at home and the office to devote time to your lioness&#8211;at least until you win her heart.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">How To Handle Her</span></p>
<p>In all probability she will be handling you, not the other way around! Leo women have a way of being in control, even if they let you think that is not the case. She&#8217;s subtle, but strong. She resists any kind of confinement, so don&#8217;t try to box her in. Throughout courtship, the Leo woman loves to tease her man, often playing cat-and-mouse games until you &#8220;catch&#8221; her. When wed, she will do anything in her power to keep things lively and fun, and will build up an entire wardrobe of imported lingerie to keep her man interested. The Leo woman loves to have her lover run his fingers through her mane. She will rarely go to bed without a touch of makeup, even if it&#8217;s just a hint of blush or scented body creme. To increase her passion, whisper to her, &#8220;You are the most beautiful woman in the world!&#8221; . . . and mean it.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy</span></p>
<p>This is one lady you are going to have to woo with gifts. She expects them, wants them, and enjoys them, so you might as well cave in and buy them for her. She looks stunning and regal in purple, so choose something in that color, whether it be a lace teddy, bra and panty set or drop-dead, killer nightie. She will also sparkle in gold&#8211;try getting her a classy knit sweater shot through with golden threads that shimmer in the evening light, then take her to a four star restaurant for dinner so she can wear it. Surprise her with an overnight stay at a rustic hotel with ornate wooden architecture and antique furniture. Make sure to reserve a room with a roaring fireplace. Or send her two dozen long-stemmed roses (don&#8217;t even THINK of trying to get away with one dozen), a generous box of imported bittersweet chocolates or a bottle of fine champagne for you both to drink later. Buy her tickets to the opera in New York or Rome (orchestra seats, of course.) If buying her a ring or other jewelry, know that she adores sapphires, the gem ruling her sign. Start saving now! It&#8217;s true, loving a Leo can be a second career in itself. But she&#8217;ll adore you for your generosity and will insure you both will have a hell of a lot of fun. So what if the American Express bill is gigantic? Yours will be a life fully enjoyed and a love like no other you could imagine.</p>
<p class="text">Your lioness likes to play games. So, try a serious game of strip poker. Or, if you know each other very well, do a variation on the movie Indecent Proposal. Remember when Demi Moore had to decide whether to take the cool million and bed Robert Redford or stay loyal to Woody Harrelson and give up their dream house? Near the end of the film there is a scene where she and Woody make love on a bed of hundred dollar (or higher) bills. In your own private remake, you are the millionaire, but you don&#8217;t have to share her with anyone. For fun, strew her bed with lots of crisp, new crumpled dollar bills (if it&#8217;s ones, not fifties or hundreds, who cares?). Leo women have fertile imaginations and a fabulous sense of drama. She&#8217;ll adore your little make-believe and beg you to think of more!</p>
