<h1>the-leo-man<h1>

	    	<p><span class="text">Ruled by the Sun, giver of life and strength, the Leo man is gregarious and warm-hearted. He is impossible not to notice. His powerful masculinity and commanding presence will be felt immediately, and his sense of showmanship and drama make him sexy and charismatic. He may work in the arts (especially the theater), or do some sort of creative work. He will probably head up a division of a company, if not the entire corporation. Leo men are leaders, not followers.</span></p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Your Challenge</span></p>
<p>Leos are a bit self-absorbed and their egos are huge. Yet they are so warmhearted and loving that these faults will look trivial in the grand overview. He is jealous and possessive, especially in the courting stage, so you will need to find ways to derail his wrath if you plan to date others simultaneously. One thing that Leo doesn&#8217;t entertain, is the possibility of being Number Two. He&#8217;d rather walk.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">How To Handle Him</span></p>
<p>Gaining the admiration and respect of others is the single most important aspect of the Leo personality for you to keep in mind. This is their driving force, winning out over money, fame and just about anything else. Another aspect of their nature is their love of children and their intolerance of criticism about them from others. Say something detracting about a Leo&#8217;s child and you will get a glimpse of the mighty lion&#8217;s temper. If he runs low on cash, he won&#8217;t accept a loan from you, so don&#8217;t be bewildered or get hurt feelings, if this happens. Leo prides himself in being self-sufficient.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy</span></p>
<p>Since Leo likes the best of everything, have some cold champagne (with a good label) on ice nearby, some lightly toasted bread and a tiny jar of imported caviar on a silver tray with your best china and crystal. Your Leo lover likes luxury. Your bedding should be new and fresh &#8212; never threadbare. Leo also appreciates flowers, but since he puts a premium on uniqueness, make them exotic or don&#8217;t bother.</p>
<p class="text">Leos have a strong sense of drama and presentation, so if you go to a restaurant, choose one which is hotly reviewed, frequented by beautiful people and offers four-star quality. (This is going to be hard on your wallet, I know!) Start the evening off by complementing him on something he did recently or how great he looks. Be sure you look great too&#8211;Leo wants someone fabulous on his arm. (You&#8217;ll rarely hear a Leo scold his lady for spending too much on herself.) Don&#8217;t bring up other beaux or talk about those of your past. Your lion is ruled by the Sun and wants to be the center of your universe. He won&#8217;t tolerate competition&#8211;present, past or future!</p>
<p class="text">This sign rules teaching, and no other sign can quite match Leo&#8217;s ability here. Use this talent by begging him to show you new things to do together in bed. He likes to be in charge anyway, and this will only enhance his natural inclination. When you become intimately involved with him you will find the Leo male needs a great deal of attention and adoration. An exciting and accomplished lover, he will expect you to spend a considerable time on him. Yet his loyalty, devotion and extreme generosity to you will win you over, and soon you&#8217;ll find yourself looking for ways to satisfy his every need.</p>
<p class="text">Give your Sun-ruled lover a gold pocket watch or sophisticated gold lighter, since Leo rules gold. Or, since this sign rules theater, tickets to the best Broadway show in town, or to the opera. He loves to dress in black tie (he is the ultimate sophisticate), so give him a good reason to dress up.</p>
<p class="text">Since music is a high priority on his list, check out which new CD titles he would most like to own, but get him Ravel&#8217;s Bolero too, if he doesn&#8217;t have it. This is perfect for Leo because of the dramatic, throbbing beat. Later that night, show him what Bolero was made for: you, after your slow flamenco-styled strip-tease tango.</p>
