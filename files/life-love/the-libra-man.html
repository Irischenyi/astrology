	    	<p><span class="text">Libra is the natural sign of partnership, so it follows that the Libra man prefers being married (or at least living together) over flying solo. He will work toward making his union strong and happy. True justice is a very important issue with Libra, and sometimes you might find him moping around murmuring &#8220;It&#8217;s not fair!&#8221; No one has yet succeeded to convince him that life in general isn&#8217;t fair. Libras have a strong ideas about making life fair, and they make their decisions and arrange their actions around what they feel is the most just and equitable solution. When drawn into a dispute, your Libra lover will quickly state his position and he&#8217;s done&#8211;there is no hanging on to old arguments, no poking into old wounds, and never any sarcasm. Libras are too refined and gentlemanly to fight dirty. He will expect the same from you.</span></p>
<p class="text">Your Libra guy loves to socialize. This is one man you will not have to coax into going to or hosting a party, and, oh, the parties that they give! They are the best! Libras are the ones who know everyone, and there is sure to be a famous face or two at one of their bashes.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Your Challenge</span></p>
<p>Libra men have so many friends and are so charming themselves, that it is hard to know where you stand, at least at the beginning of a relationship. They are very loyal once they commit, but until then, this air sign tends to flit around like a butterfly and is rather hard to pin down. Initially, what you have to do is draw attention to yourself in a ladylike way and make him realize you are the companion he wants to spend his time with.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">How To Handle Him</span></p>
<p>Lovemaking is something Libra will look forward to with relish&#8211;rarely will he want anything quick or rushed. He enjoys the process of seduction, something he has elevated to an art form, and he will take his time with his woman, careful to attend to her emotional needs as well as her physical ones. He is quite visual in orientation and likes his to see you dressed in elegant lingerie (Libra is a refined sign, so don&#8217;t get too trashy or flashy). When you are getting ready to make love a Libra, wear your most elegant jewelry, like pretty earrings and a fine necklace, with little lacy underthings he can easily remove.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy</span></p>
<p>Libra is ruled by Venus, who controls the arts, so music is very important to him and he will have a great stereo system at home. Buying him a good car stereo or auto CD player is a great way to make sure he always picks you up in a wonderful mood.</p>
<p class="text">Here&#8217;s an idea for a Libran seduction: propose a day spent touring a pretty rural locale and tuck some of his favorite music into the glove compartment. Don&#8217;t forget to pack a gourmet picnic basket (Libra likes fine food and delicacies). While he is driving and his hands are full, start to touch him&#8211;before you know it, you will be pulled over on a small dirt road, the music reaching crescendo, while he makes love to you in the back seat, just like two high school teenagers. There is something devilishly lovely about doing it in the back seat of his BMW or Lexus (many Libra men are lawyers, so they can afford good cars). Later, suggest you go to a drive-in movie but don&#8217;t permit any monkey business there&#8211;make him concentrate on the film. Libras appreciate subtle plotting like this. Pet him all the way home as he drives, helpless in his securely fastened seat belt. By time you are inside the door he&#8217;ll be ready for you all over again!</p>
