	    	<p><span class="text">The Scorpion is determined, shrewd, protective, jealous, and powerful. It is a sign prone to obsession, and the Scorpio man is not nonchalant about anything, from his career to his love life. Symbolized by the phoenix rising from the ashes, this bird aptly suggests Scorpio&#8217;s incredible ability to regenerate from seemingly disastrous situations. Much has been written about how sexy and mysterious Scorpio is. To him sex is very important, and it would be impossible for him to have a happy relationship without great sex. The Scorpio male is macho, a modern day 007: thrilling, strong, silent and handsome.</span></p>
<p><span class="subtitle">Your Challenge</span></p>
<p>One of the challenges of being in love with a Scorpio male is to get him to voice his innermost thoughts and feelings. Sometimes it is impossible know exactly what a Scorpio is thinking! He can be a temperamental, jealous lover, so watch your step. You will have to play by his rules or leave him. With this man, there are no shades of gray.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">How To Handle Him</span></p>
<p>Still waters run deep, and you will find him fiercely loyal and deeply passionate. This Pluto ruled-lover would never dream of divulging details of your private life together to others, and expects the same from you. Woe to the woman who strays from his bed to another lover, for he will never forgive her. The Scorpion&#8217;s sting is never used casually, only when he feels threatened to the core, for its sting kills not only the victim but the Scorpion itself. Scorpio will never suffer betrayal.</p>
<p><span class="subtitle">Things to do, gifts to buy</span></p>
<p>If you want to get your Scorpio lover a bit more relaxed and focused on you, try taking him to a small, cozy restaurant that serves solid manly food like a juicy steak and fries. Red wine will probably be his choice over champagne. The Scorpio male is no delicate gourmand. He would love a dark, rich chocolate mouse for dessert, if he likes sweets (some Scorpios do, some don&#8217;t). Wear your little black dress or something in burgundy, his favorite color.</p>
<p class="text">Your Scorpio will want you to be uninhibited. Don&#8217;t become offended if he suggests viewing a sex video together. He does not see pornography as degrading to women, but as research and stimulus for new things to do. Since this sign rules law enforcement, crime and punishment, suggest he play policeman with you. Give him a gift box containing a blindfold and some handcuffs and you&#8217;ll be all set. This man likes trying out a little light S&amp;M playacting too so if you trust him, be cooperative if wants to put his naughty girl over his knee for a little spanking. This intense sign will insist on being the one in control, but surrendering to a Scorpio can be divine rapture.</p>
