	    	<p><span class="text">The Scorpio woman has great charm, allure, and inner strength, and is able to overcome most any obstacle in life. She comes across as self-confident and self-possessed and men are drawn to her for that reason. There is a mysterious quality about the Scorpio woman, because she is intensely private, discrete and secretive. Soon she will learn everything about you, but later you will realize that she hasn&#8217;t given you many details about herself&#8211;that&#8217;s Scorpio&#8217;s natural reticence.</span></p>
<p class="text">Finally, the operative word to best understand your Scorpio lover is &#8220;passion.&#8221; One Scorpio once said to me that passion was the single most important ingredient in life, that is, to be passionate about one&#8217;s loved ones, one&#8217;s career, one&#8217;s lifestyle, for without passion, what kind of life would we have in the end? Well said!</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Your Challenge</span></p>
<p>Your Scorpio beauty is attracted to power, so if you have it, you are ahead of the game. Your other challenge will be that this lady has a mind of her own, so if you think you can tame her, forget it.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">How To Handle Her</span></p>
<p>Her highly intuitive nature makes her a mind reader extraordinaire, so don&#8217;t try to hide anything from her. If you are trying to impress her with power you don&#8217;t have, her Pluto-ruled nature will sense it like a homing device. (Certainly you don&#8217;t want to activate her seek and destroy mechanism.) In love and friendship, she is true-blue loyal and will expect the same from you. If you show her the slightest reason to distrust you, however, she will never forgive you. On the other hand, treat her well and she will reward you for the rest of your life. Home and family are regarded as sacred, and Scorpio will defend and support her man to the ends of the earth. Like Leo women, Scorpio women are into control, and with her magnetic, femme fatale powers, she will soon have the upper hand. After all, who could resist her famous Scorpion gaze, those memorable bedroom eyes?</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy</span></p>
<p>If you take your Scorpio beloved out for dinner, make it a private little dark rendezvous, overlooking water if possible or better yet, as a guest on a private yacht (preferably yours). The Scorpion woman will always be understated with her powerful sexuality&#8211;she doesn&#8217;t need to flaunt it, it exudes naturally. In her dress, she is very careful about her accessories, buying only the finest shoes and handbags, and if she needs one, an elegant leather brief case. She knows these accessories punctuate her entire look and impart a feeling of true elegance. Get her quality things made out of leather (down, boy, not those things). If treating her to perfume, get her a modern oriental or something of musk and subtly sexual.</p>
<p class="text">While the Scorpio woman is always a lady in public, she loves being her man&#8217;s fantasy woman in the bedroom. Buy her some new lingerie in of her most flattering tones: maroon, eggplant or a black. Elegant French and Italian imported lingerie will impress her so buy her a demi-cup push up bra, tiny, sheer g-string bikini and elegant garter belt, complete with a pair of black seamed stockings. She may also be amused and aroused by a lavishly illustrated photography book by Helmut Newton or Doris Kloster. If you get lucky, she may want to experiment a little by lap dancing for you and you alone.</p>
<p class="text">This sign rules detective work, so plan a mystery for her. She has a rich imagination and this should work whether you&#8217;ve known her a month or a decade. Tell her to meet you in the most elegant hotel bar in town. When you spot her, stand at the other end of the bar and have the waiter send over a glass of champagne and a note from you. By now the suggestive nature of your behavior will have the staff murmuring and staring and it will begin to turn her on tremendously. After the second or third drink, send her the key to your room in a small envelope. (Book their best suite ahead of time and stock it with roses and.) When she&#8217;s pocketed the key, have her meet you by the elevator. Ride up alone, pushing her against the back wall of the elevator and tell her in great detail what you have planned. Show her the silk ribbons you&#8217;ve tucked into your breast pocket&#8211;Scorpio is intrigued by bondage. Although she will try her hardest not to show it, she will be aching for you to begin. She won&#8217;t forget this mystery, and neither will you!</p>
