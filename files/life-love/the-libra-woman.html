	    	<p><span class="text">Libra women have busy social calendars and keep happy by surrounding themselves with adoring friends. Still, this lady wants to be married, so don&#8217;t be fooled by her gadding about. Once wed, she will attend to her marriage as fiercely as her career.</span></p>
<p class="text">Always fashionably-dressed, she favors an eclectic look, mixing designer things with antique pieces. The final effect is smart and sexy, never dowdy. This Venus-ruled beauty is beautifully groomed, and smells as good as she looks, for she never leaves the house without a light spray of something intoxicating. Her figure is usually curvy, svelte and feminine, so you don&#8217;t even stand a chance of resisting her. The most memorable quality about your Libra lover is her quintessential grace; in every movement she makes, every word she utters, she is poetry in motion.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Your Challenge</span></p>
<p>Your mission 007, is to capture her heart. Not an easy task, considering the line of men waiting in line. She has no shortage of opportunities, so competition will be stiff.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">How To Handle Her</span></p>
<p>She has powerful talents of persuasion and her lover may not know exactly how she gets her way, but she does every time&#8211;in the most charming fashion. Be wary of getting wrapped around her little finger, for although she may protest, she secretly likes a man who stands up to her now and then. If you are only semi-conscious most of the time, you don&#8217;t stand a chance of winning her heart.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Things to do, gifts to buy</span></p>
<p>Think of the cherubs in old master paintings, flying though the air, holding branches of roses or a lovely harp. This describes your angelic lover. She&#8217;d adore anything decorative, from sweetheart roses, soft silk lingerie in a delicate colors, to perfume in a modern or gentle floral tone (nothing jarring for Libra). One of Libra&#8217;s favorite gifts is jewelry, but it has to be the real thing. Costume jewelry will tarnish, just like your relationship will if you try to give her this. Robbing a bank may be your only choice to get her what she wants. She might also enjoy a beautiful mirror, framed in gold leaf. Let&#8217;s pause a moment &#8211;perhaps you&#8217;ve just thought of something naughty? Before you get carried away, let me advise you that not all Libras like making love in front of a mirror. Venus endowed her with curves and she may be a bit self-conscious about them (silly girl.) Put the mirror up in the bedroom and let her gradually get used to it. Keep telling her how tell her how gorgeous she looks without a stitch on.</p>
<p class="text">The Libra woman adores lighter foreplay activities and is a world-class kisser. If you haven&#8217;t yet tapped into this aspect of her, you are missing one of life&#8217;s true experiences. Corner her into a hot necking session somewhere like at the movies, where the other viewers won&#8217;t care if you and she are going at one another like two kids hell bent on trouble. If you are lucky, the usher may come with her flashlight and scold you!</p>
<p class="text">When you finally get her to bed she will want a slow hand, for Libra women never marry cold fish or slam-bam-thank-you-m&#8217;am types. She is highly romantic and sensitive and wants you to be that way too. Her bed usually has many fluffy pillows and the most beautiful linens she can afford. She wants music in the bedroom, but no TV (too indelicate&#8211;who wants to hear about the Congressional budget or a mugging in Queens when one is in the throes of passion?) One last hint: Libra rules the lower back and will purr like a kitten when her man massages it with a lightly scented cream. Meow!</p>
