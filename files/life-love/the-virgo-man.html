	    	<p><span class="text">Your Virgo man is modest, meticulous and discriminating. He is a joy to live with as long as you understand the Virgo man&#8217;s obsessive need to be productive on a daily basis. He is practical, patient and is able to handle detail, and the amount of details he handles would drive others up the wall. The Virgo&#8217;s talent is knowing how to make dreams (their own and those of others) a reality.</span></p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Your Challenge</span></p>
<p>Virgos are worriers, so your first step will be to calm him down when you have time alone together. Often workaholics, your Virgo will have a hard time detaching from his everyday schedule. But you must, for they are incredibly passionate lovers once his total attention has been turned to you.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">How to Handle Him</span></p>
<p>He&#8217;s productivity oriented, so &#8220;goofing off&#8221; might be a foreign idea and too scary for him at the onset. Since Virgo is wonderful at fixing things&#8211;his sharp mind hungers for things to take apart and figure out&#8211;so ask him to help you out. Tell him that you are hopeless with home repairs and he has got to come over and take a look at your air conditioner. His small motor skills are the finest in the zodiac, so many Virgos like to putter around the house, looking for little projects. Puttering takes their minds off more stressful issues.</p>
<p class="text">Remind him how turned-on you were when you saw him wearing worn jeans and a plaid lumberjack shirt, jump-starting his car. Tell him you fantasize about him walking around your apartment measuring walls for shelving, just wearing his tool belt. (This kind of flattery will accomplish two things: you will have a hot, passionate lover ready to ravish you and no more leaky faucets.) Cruise around Home Depot, just to get him in the mood. Then, one afternoon when he is putting in a new set of florescent lights over your kitchen counter, pounce on him and tell him you are getting hot watching him screw those huge bulbs in. Make love to him right then and there.</p>
<p class="text">To thank him for all his home improvement, you might want to take him to dinner. When choosing the restaurant, remember that a Virgo&#8217;s digestive system is delicate. Most Virgos dislike overly rich food and try to eat balanced healthful meals. Many are vegetarians.</p>
<p class="text">Another point to consider is that Virgo has a strong need to be highly organized. So when seducing the Virgo man, be sure you have a neat bedroom and put unnecessary clutter out of sight. (Seeing junk around will make him edgy.) In bed, the Virgo man is like the Gemini (both are ruled by Mercury) in that his need to communicate is strong. Talking during lovemaking will heighten his pleasure and add to his passion for you.</p>
<p class="text">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy Many Virgos are talented writers. Their reserved nature makes them express in writing what they would have difficulty saying in person. Happily, you may be the lucky recipient of one of the wonderful love letters only a Virgo could write. Drop hints that you would like to receive something written especially for you. A perfect gift for him would be a beautiful fountain pen or engraved stationary. He would also adore a P.D.A. or electronic organizer, a laptop computer, new software, or even a dust buster for his car. You could also buy him a deluxe tool kit (don&#8217;t forget those metric socket wrenches too) and let matters take their own course!</p>
