	    	<p><span class="text">Love an Aries woman? She&#8217;s modern all the way, full of spunk and drive. You will likely find her running her own business, or heading up a division in her company, for Aries is the sign that rules entrepreneurial ventures. She is a woman of strength, has well-formed and intelligent opinions, and part of her charm is that she is so thoroughly independent and self-reliant. Aries is a fire sign and therefore quite imaginative, born to lead rather than to follow.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Your Challenge</span></p>
<p>To keep up with her, you&#8217;ve got to think of some original things to do together&#8211;the &#8220;same old, same old&#8221; will never rate with her.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">How To Handle Her</span></p>
<p>In bed, the Aries woman will often enjoy initiating the lovemaking, much to your delight. Allow her that pleasure and enjoy the fireworks. Sexually, she will be creative and even humorous, and her sense of adventure will lead her to try many things.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy</span></p>
<p>Take her to an amusement park and try out the fastest, scariest rides together&#8211;she&#8217;ll be all the more passionate later. If you are giving her perfume, choose a fragrance that has depth and character&#8211;it could have a hint of spice or be a new, modern blend. (One thing is certain, your grandmother&#8217;s sweet rose or lily of the valley just isn&#8217;t her style). Another idea would be to give her a gift certificate for a new hairstyle by a famous hairdresser she&#8217;s read about in her favorite fashion magazine. A fine imported hairbrush would be a good gift idea too. Aries rules the head, and a bad hair day is no joke for our girl. Having her hair just right gives her increased self confidence, and by giving her a chic new look, she&#8217;s apt to be delighted. Be prepared for her open demonstrations of her love for you! If you would rather choose something for her that is a bit more sexy, get her a short satin wrap robe with matching demi-bra and tiny thong panties, in her favorite color, bright red.</p>
<p class="text">An Aries girl loves uniforms, so let her see you in your Navy dress whites the next time you call on her. If you don&#8217;t have an &#8220;Officer and an Gentleman&#8221; uniform around, any other uniform will do. Do you have a friend who is a UPS or FedEx delivery man? You are in luck&#8211;borrow his uniform and pretend to be a delivery man. This will really ring her bell! Take note all &#8220;suits&#8221;: every Aries woman looks forward to those sexy, well-muscled UPS guys, even when they&#8217;re dumping more work for them to do on the counter! Your working-class stud attire could be a fantasy-come-true.</p>
<p class="text">If you want to be late for work and get the bathroom all steamy, try this: when you&#8217;re shaving one morning, stand at the sink completely nude, with the water running, and your face all lathered up with shaving cream. As you shave, be completely oblivious to her staring at you and just talk naturally with her about everyday matters&#8211;the more mundane the better. For example, ask, &#8220;Shall I pick up the Dijon mustard after I get the stuff from the dry cleaner?&#8221; Shave your face slowly&#8211;and wait for her reaction . Aries rules sharp instruments, so watching you wield your razor in such a masterful fashion will send her temperature rising&#8211;and could be start the start of a wonderful day for you!</p>
