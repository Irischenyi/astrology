<h1>the-gemini-man<h1>

	    	<p><span class="text">Your Gemini man is full of wit and charm, and often the center of attention, as he delights everyone with a new joke he just heard or a story about what happened to him at work. Since Gemini rules Hermes, the messenger of the Gods, Gemini men are often writers or reporters. They are brilliant communicators, and can talk their way into any opportunity or out of any tight spot.</span></p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Your Challenge</span></p>
<p>This guy likes to keep up-to-date on things, so you&#8217;ll have to get his head out of The New York Times and all his other daily doses of news. Nobody reads as many current periodicals as a Gemini! His coffee table probably looks like a newsstand. When he gets done reading, he is likely to be switching on the TV news. You will have to do something with this news junkie or he&#8217;ll stay wrapped up in current events. The key is to convince him that you are the most interesting event in his life!</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">How To Handle Him</span></p>
<p>First of all, be one of his best news sources. Before you meet up with him, call him with something you just heard on Reuters. Leave a voice mail on his office phone with a late-breaking story, or fax over clippings from a newspaper on a topic that interests him greatly. That will get his initial attention and you&#8217;ll be able to move on to more intimate matters.</p>
<p class="text">Keep in mind that Gemini needs constant variety and change; the more surprising and spontaneous you are, the more he will love you. Never reveal everything about yourself to a Gemini, for once they get the idea there is nothing new to discover, they will be tempted to look elsewhere. Gemini men have a deep need to try and figure you out, so keep him guessing!</p>
<p class="text">Be verbal in bed during lovemaking. This will really turn him on. Don&#8217;t be shy! Gemini is a highly-intelligent sign, stimulated by both exciting talk and the written word, and appealing to his mind and imagination will keep your sex life lively. Try reading passages from a sexy novel. (Make sure the novel has some literary value&#8211;if it is too trashy, he will wonder about your educational level, another important aspect to smart Gemini). Also, try leaving love notes in his suit pockets, his briefcase or anywhere he might casually come across them. Few signs appreciate the now-dead art of writing love letters more than a Gemini.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy</span></p>
<p>Treat your Gemini man to a massage with a subtly-fragranced oil to reduce his nervous tension. He is ruled by Mercury, the planet controlling the entire nervous system, and his nerves get jangled easily. Pay particular attention to his hands, for they are susceptible to stress (probably because he is at the keyboard so much). Geminis always appear to be far younger than their years and have great charisma. To best bring out this boyish charm, flirt with him. (Gemini is the best flirt of the zodiac and he will flirt right back.) Step up your witty game of verbal Ping-Pong, if you&#8217;re ready for wildfire. No doubt he will be sitting at his computer while you talk with him, for Gemini always does two things at once. As he sits there, intently pounding out his great American novel, seduce him while he is working. Slowly unbutton his shirt as you stand behind his chair and rub his chest. Soon he will be putty in your hands.</p>
<p class="text">Gemini is symbolized by the twins flying through the air, and your Gemini man is happiest when flying to some distant city. Surprise him with tickets for two to a far-away island. Then, use the fact that he&#8217;s an air sign to your advantage: seduce him on the flight (the rest room might be small but useful here). He&#8217;ll be in his element and more in &#8220;in the mood&#8221; than anywhere else!</p>
<p class="text">Do Geminis stray? Only if they get bored. What you need to do is to keep them excited and mentally engaged in you. Therefore, here is the ultimate gift for communication-oriented Gemini: Give him a year of internet access along with at least one sexy e-mail message from you per week! What better way for him to stay focused on you?</p>
