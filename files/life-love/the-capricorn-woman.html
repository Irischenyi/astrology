	    	<p><span class="text">The Capricorn woman is the one with the good gold jewelry, neutral tweed or classic Brooks Brothers suits and silk shirts. She always looks highly successful, or like she comes from old money (even if she doesn&#8217;t.)</span></p>
<p class="text">Your Capricorn woman realizes the value of a solid social network and will join organizations which will help her up the career ladder. Her lover will soon realize that he will need to share her with the world, and will be proud of her long list of accomplishments. She will come across as serious, conservative, shy, detailed, organized and self-disciplined. She delivers on her promises. She keeps her word and everything that bears her name is the best she can muster.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Your Challenge</span></p>
<p>Your Capricorn lover is practical&#8211;coming from a good background and having success potential is important to her. Some Capricorn women marry for social position, others are just concerned that their husband to be will be able to support her in the manner to which she is accustomed. You&#8217;ll need to convince her of your earnest ambition and your solid future. If you&#8217;re socially connected, by all means, don&#8217;t hide it.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">How To Handle Her</span></p>
<p>In love she is slow and careful. Never one to wander from one flirtation to another, the Capricorn woman has her feet well planted on the ground. If her man suggests something new to her and she isn&#8217;t sure, he should give her time. Capricorn generally likes to mull things over and get used to ideas. She must never be forced or she will resist for sure.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="subtitle">Things To Do, Gifts To Buy</span></p>
<p>When getting her jewelry, think about buying an antique piece of estate jewelry, or give her something handed down from your grandmother. For a lovely dinner, take her to your club or to a restaurant that looks like a grand estate. Afterwards, give her a madly romantic experience, such as a carriage ride through the park in the snow, with warm blanket and brandy afterwards, or plan to meet her on top of a tall building, such as the Empire State building at 11:00 PM (Å¡ la An Affair to Remember, but in this version, both of you show up). Kiss her passionately, and promise her your true love.</p>
<p class="text">Later, take her back to your apartment. Since this sign rules history, buy her a historical romance novel and read steamy portions of it to her in bed. Or, rent a romantic video, set in the days of knights and princes. Your lady is so used to making all the decisions at home and at work that she is tired of it all. She wants to be rescued now and then instead of having to rescue everyone else. Transfer all those feelings to you. Here is your chance to be her real life knight in shining armor and you will have her heart for life.</p>
