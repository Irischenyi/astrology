<p class="text">Fire signs are full of power and light. They are highly creative and burst with enthusiasm and energy. Fire signs enjoy playing with new ideas and concepts, so it is no wonder they are the trendsetters of the zodiac. Born leaders, others are drawn to these charismatic, natural sparklers. Their high ideals, broad vision, passion and assertive, can-do attitude is inspirational . . . and contagious. Fire signs have plenty of courage and initiative too, and for all these reasons, it has been said that fire signs rule the spirit and primal life force.</p>
<p class="text">Fire signs tend to have strong egos, so being the center of attention comes naturally to them. People of this group put a strong emphasis on individuality and independence, so don&#8217;t hem them in.</p>
<p class="text">Aries, the first sign of the zodiac, expresses some of these qualities most purely. Aries is the most entrepreneurial sign, always generating fresh starts, new ideas and new methods. Business or the armed forces is their natural arena. Aries are self-motivated and are at their happiest when self-employed (or running their departments as if they owned them).</p>
<p class="text">The next fire sign, Leo, expresses its fire element in a more cultural, creative way. Leos are often gifted painters, playwrights, actors, or designers. But no matter what their occupation, there is always a bit of the performer in Leos. They treasure uniqueness and need to put their individual stamp on whatever they do.</p>
<p class="text">Sagittarius, the third fire sign, directs its energy internationally, through the initiative of education, research, travel, and scholarship. Sagittarius&#8217;s calling is to collect, synthesize and protect historical knowledge, which is why this sign is so philosophical. Sagittarius are creative in the interpretation of the information they absorb, and use their knowledge to advance the understanding of humanity&#8217;s universal citizenship.</p>
