	    	<h4>Are You a Fire, Earth, Air or Water Sign?</h4>
<p class="text">All the astrological signs are evenly divided into four main elements: <b><a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/fire/">fire</a></b>, <b><a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/earth/">earth</a></b>, <b><a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/air/">air</a></b> and <b><a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-elements/water/">water</a></b>. Professional astrologers call these the &#8220;triplicies&#8221; because each element rules three zodiac signs. Knowing what element rules your sign will help you understand many of your most basic personality traits. Knowing what elements predominate in people you know will help you understand and communicate with them better.</p>
<p class="text">Keep in mind we are studying Sun signs in Astrology Zone. At a private session with a professional astrologer, you would have all your planets and your rising sign assessed by element. However, the Sun is very important in the horoscope. All the planets revolve around the Sun, so it merits extra attention.</p>
