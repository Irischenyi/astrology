<p class="text">Water takes many forms&#8211;it can be a liquid, it can be a gas (as in steam), or it can be frozen. It can be gentle as a little babbling brook, or violent as a thundering tidal wave.</p>
<p class="text">Torrents of passion well within water signs and they feel things deeply. However, water signs are always emotionally reserved, no matter what impression they might give on the surface. Still water, it as been said, runs deep, and the mystery about water pertains to this group (especially Scorpio). A water sign will always become quiet or withdrawn when they are trying to sort things out. It will take some time to get to know them well, for they reveal themselves slowly. They realize their intense emotions hold tremendous power, and they tend to handle their feelings carefully. When they fall in love, water signs love with their whole hearts and all their devotion. Their sensitivity makes them highly romantic, even sentimental. Often psychic, water signs read your true intentions simply by reading your gestures and body language and will trust actions more than words (Pisces, particularly, has elevated this talent to high art).</p>
<p class="text">Water cleanses us and sustains life on earth. Water is the universal solvent, breaking substances down&#8211;dissolving them&#8211;and taking on their qualities. Therefore, when you share a problem with a water sign, they take on your problem as if it were their own. Their ability to sympathize and empathize is awesome; you&#8217;ll get their full attention, a shoulder to cry on, and some excellent advice to boot. Because they give of themselves so readily, water signs need regular time alone to regain their center.</p>
<p class="text">This element rules the soul. Water does not like to be confined and they will assert their strong need for freedom, no matter how gently it is expressed (unlike fire signs).</p>
<p class="text">This is a highly imaginative group and very creative. Their observations on the human condition often inspire masterpieces of painting, music, photography, literature, or dance. Working in studios or small self-employed businesses (usually connected to the creative arts) appeals to water signs. Their right-on-target-intuition makes them succeed in financial areas too. (Fortune recently reported more self-made millionaires are Pisces than any other sign. Astrologically, we know Scorpios and Cancers are no financial slouches either!)</p>
<p class="text">Water signs specialize in private relationships, but their focus differs from sign to sign. Cancer expresses their water element in the nurturing, preservation and protection of the family, which is the smallest unit upon which society is built, and yet the most important. Sharing love with spouse and children is of paramount importance to Cancer and they take the role of provider very seriously.</p>
<p class="text">Scorpio&#8217;s domain is to investigate the two most personal of inter-relationships: sexual and financial transactions between individuals. (Social scientists tell us most people would sooner speak about sex than money&#8211;both, very private matters!) Scorpio&#8217;s sexual side represents the sign&#8217;s control over the perpetuation of the species. Symbolized by the phoenix rising from the ashes, Scorpio governs the 8th house, representing birth, death and regeneration. Scorpios have a shrewd business sense (the 8th house is also a financial one, ruling &#8220;other people&#8217;s money&#8221;) and therefore Scorpios make superb negotiators. Their mysterious nature inhibits them from giving away information to the other side.</p>
<p class="text">Pisces is the last sign of the zodiac and a compilation of all the signs that came before, which is why Pisces blends so well with other signs. Outer-directed, Pisces&#8217; deep spirituality leads them to help others on a one-to-one basis (unlike air sign Aquarius&#8217; approach: doing good with others). Pisces are moved to relieve any pain they perceive in another, and they stand ready to offer the very shirt off their back. Pisces rules sacrifice, and there is almost nothing Pisces won&#8217;t do for a relative or friend in need.</p>
