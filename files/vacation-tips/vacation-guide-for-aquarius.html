<h1>vacation-guide-for-aquarius<h1>

	    	<p class="text">Going anywhere too ordinary or touristy will bore you, dear Aquarius, so make sure your next vacation is an adventure. Uranus, the planet that often brings an interest in science, rules your sign, and gives you the inclination for trips to places such as Florida Kennedy Space Center, the Great Barrier reef, or, for little Aquarians, to Disney World&#8217;s Epcot Center.</p>
<p>A vacation in the great outdoors also would be a good choice; an offbeat trip to an unexplored area you have never seen would be ideal. Look into Alaska, the Canadian Rockies, the North Pole or other natural wonders like The Grand Tetons, The Grand Canyon, Yellowstone National Park, Yosemite National Park, Zion National Park, and Monument Valley.</p>
<p>Want to go farther afield? Visit the Swiss Alps, or travel through the mountains of Chile, Guatemala or Peru. Remember to bring along your telescope; being out in open spaces will allow you to see the stars dazzle most brightly.</p>
<p>Politically aware on a global level, your strong intellectual curiosity and humanitarian instincts might be sated by visiting a country or city where social change is underway. Consider a trip to Russia, China, Hong Kong or the Slavic countries.</p>
<p>Go on a trip for two weeks and not check your e-mail? Not likely for Aquarius! You are usually inseparable from your laptop, and being an air sign, you like to stay in touch with the outside world. If you don&#8217;t have a laptop, wireless PDA or other way of checking your email, ask a friend or relative to check your e-mail for you, and ask them to call you on if any important messages come in.</p>
<p>Before you go on vacation, you will likely do thorough research on the Internet concerning airfare, rental cars, hotels, restaurants, and for a full list of things to do. Often the best bargains are found on the net, so aside from being convenient, the deals are often quite attractive. You like spontaneity and maximum flexibility, so you would probably prefer to design your own itinerary rather than sign up for a packaged tour. Avoid the temptation to over-plan, and allow time for some wonderful happenstance. On an Aquarius vacation, it always does!</p>
<p>Too much togetherness with any partner can make you feel claustrophobic, so if you travel in twos, you should plan a little time alone, perhaps to shop, take a walk or have a cup of coffee in a local outdoor café. Still, Aquarians are also quite gregarious, so while you love the wild, you like civilization too; find a good balance.</p>
