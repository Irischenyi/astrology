        <p>This month, June, could be a major game-changer when you turn away from career concerns and focus on making your home life more inviting and reflective of you. If you have been looking for a new house or apartment, or want to buy or rent other property, it is unlikely that you would have found your dream space before the new moon appears in your fourth house of home and family. New moons open a portal of opportunity, and you will likely be excited about one space in the days that follow the new moon on June 6 in Gemini at 16 degrees.</p>
<p>This lovely new moon will enter with her partner the Sun (opportunity) along with Venus (beauty), Mercury (news), and Jupiter (luck). This new moon will support you in many ways. Perhaps the most important aspect is Mercury in conjunction with good-fortune Jupiter on June 4. Wow. This only happens once a year, and it is coinciding with the new moon! It will be 12 years before Mercury and Jupiter will meet again in Gemini in your house of home. You really are luckier than a Leprechaun, dear Pisces.</p>
<p>Mercury and Jupiter will still be within tight mathematical significance at the new moon June 6, which will heap more luck on you. Your house of home and family is ruled by Mercury, the reason that planet will play a leading role at the new moon. Gemini is an air sign, and like the wind, news will start to arrive swiftly. Gemini is a double-bodied sign, so if you are looking for a house, you may find two apartments or houses that you like, and you can choose your favorite. Even if you are shopping for furniture, you may have a hard time choosing between two handsome pieces. With Gemini, everything arrives in twos.</p>
<p>At the new moon, Mercury will receive a friendly beam from Pluto, so if you are doing some demolition work, working on the plumbing, or are redoing the basement, Pluto’s support will be a gift from the angels. Venus will be in lovely angle to the new moon, adding beauty to your vision of your home to be.</p>

        <p>If you are not thinking about your physical home, you may be finding ways to help a parent in need. I remember when my sister and I worked on finding solutions for our mother, Little Mom, who we loved dearly. She was well enough to be home, so we had to find a warm, trustworthy aide to live with her and do cooking, grocery shopping, and laundry and take her to the doctor occasionally.</p>
<p>We also needed to have a backup aide if the primary aide could not work that day. We found the right solution, but initially, we felt like we had been submerged in a subculture we knew nothing about—but we learned quickly and made the right decisions. Little Mom was very happy to be able to live home, and she loved the aids that cared for her.</p>
<p>Good-fortune Jupiter has not been in Gemini for 12 years, so if you have been thinking of doing extensive repairs (or you have a fixer upper), this year would be a superb time to do so. If you are looking at new spaces to move into or are talking to a contractor to transform your space, you will have the element of enormous luck, so don’t settle for anything less than your dream vision.</p>

        <p>Benefic Jupiter brings a large, sunny space with large closets and often offers a sweeping view. The house or apartment would be in the neighborhood you hoped to live, or close to it. Jupiter entered your home sector on May 25, and you will have Jupiter for an entire year, until June 9, 2025, so you have time to plan and look. I will admit, this month’s new moon comes laden with such special opportunity that I would like you to look at your options now.</p>
<p>Something else is happening that is special and very lucky. Jupiter and Pluto will be in perfect sync, so although you may spend more than you had planned to buy the house or condo, or more for a renovation than you estimated, the results will be stunning and give you great value.</p>
<p>You can buy or rent a beautiful vacation home or rent your first apartment and love it so much you will want all your friends to come over to see it. You might, instead, buy a new piece of furniture—possibly at a bargain—that makes your living room look just right. Remember, Jupiter brings luck, so bargains are possible.</p>
<p>Have you been wondering when to refresh your living quarters, and not sure when to start?</p>
<p>In a way, it’s now or never dear Pisces.</p>

        <p>I am being dramatic, but after this trend is over, you’ll need to wait 12 year until you have aspects this spectacular again. This new moon and Sun will be conjunct Venus, a very good sign that you will love your interior design choices later.</p>
<p>The only problem will be Saturn, currently in Pisces and square the new moon, so you may be very cognizant of the weight of the decision you are making. Saturn makes us grow up and also makes us tackle a big goal, one that only a year or two ago would have been beyond your ability to do. Saturn is now at 18 degrees, pressing on Pisces with birthdays that fall within five days (plus or minus) of March 9. As I wrote last month, Pisces born in February had their hardest tests from Saturn last year.</p>
<p>You seem to have been spending a lot of money lately, but that will lessen once Mars moves out of Aries, a trend that started April 30 and will continue to June 8. After June 8, you may be able to breathe with relief.</p>
<p>Will you get a chance to travel? It’s possible when Mars enters Taurus from June 8 to July 20. You won’t likely go far or stay long with so much going on at home, but a road trip over a weekend or a short airplane jaunt would be possible.</p>
<p>You have a very social full moon due on June 21 in Capricorn, 1 degree. It looks like you will be invited to a party or wedding—something that will bring many friends together—and it would be quite lovely. This seems to be a not-to-miss event. By this time, Venus will have moved to Cancer, a perfect place for you to enjoy love. Venus will glide through Cancer from June 17 to July 11.</p>
<p>Neptune will be square the full moon, so ask about the dress code and the purpose of the party. You will want to be in sync with friends. Check the address too—it looks like you may have to drive or take a train to attend.</p>

        <p>Venus in Cancer and Mars in Taurus, both compatible signs for you, will be moving toward a lovely sextile, an opportunity aspect, to peak on June 28.</p>
<p>You have so much to look forward to in June!</p>
<p>Next month we will have a second full moon in Capricorn, and it is unusual to get two full moons in a row in the same sign. Next month it will fall at 29 degrees. It seems you will have another invitation on your calendar July 21.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>As you enter June, you appear to be making some very wise, long-term decisions regarding your home, other property or a family member. Home and family will be the center of your thinking, not only now, but throughout the coming year.</p>
<p>Last month, on May 25, Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, entered Gemini at the very foundation of your chart. This part of your chart, the fourth house, ruling your home, other real estate you may have interest in, and family members, such as your mother, father (or someone you think of as a parent), or other immediate family members who you feel closest to. Jupiter is set to stay in this area of your chart a little over a year, until June 9, 2025, ensuring that this part of your chart would become the happiest area of your life and also show the greatest growth and improvement.</p>
<p>To unlock the magnificent planetary power of Jupiter in Gemini, you need a new moon in Gemini, which is precisely what you will have this month on June 6. The new moon will appear with her partner the Sun, and along in the entourage will be beauty planet Venus, newsy Mercury, and benefic Jupiter.</p>

        <p>If you are young, you may be renting your first apartment. If you are a little bit older and have been saving for a house, you are likely to stumble upon one now that you love and will want to buy. Any new space you look at when Jupiter is in your fourth house of home would be large and sunny with big closets and a stunning view. If it is not, that is not the space you were meant to have. From now through June 2025 is the best time ever to improve your living experience in over 12 years.</p>
<p>It is true that you will have a year in which to act, but this month is so unusual and sparkles with a nearly blinding light, I would like you to make a decision and close on a house or condo apartment now, if you are ready.</p>
<p>The sign of Gemini is on the cusp of your fourth house of home, and Gemini is a double-bodied sign of the Twins—you may now rent or buy a beautiful vacation home or a pied-a-terre as a place to stay when you travel to a certain city. As you see, you could have two homes to enjoy because with Gemini, everything comes in twos.</p>
<p>If you love the home you have now, you can give it a refresh—a renovation or paint job, or you may redecorate or acquire one or two pieces of handsome furniture. If you live in the country, you may beautify the land surrounding your house with the help of a talented landscape designer.</p>

        <p>You might instead decide to use this energy to help a family member. You might ask your mother to live with you, if you have a large enough place, to make it easier for you to help her if she needs assistance. In another instance, you may help your daughter care for her new baby. If you have been concerned about the welfare of one of your children, you will find the right expert to advise you during Jupiter’s year-long stay in this area of your chart.</p>
<p>Saturn, the teacher planet, who tutors us on life lessons and helps us move through many milestones of maturity, has been in Pisces for a little over a year and will stay until February 2026. Your ruler, Neptune, is the planet of unconditional love and compassion and is also in Pisces. This year you may be called on to make a sacrifice of something you want for yourself so that a beloved relative can benefit. You may be concerned about that person’s well-being, and with Saturn in Pisces, you know that you are the only one in the family in a position to provide the help for that person. It is not Saturn’s nature to force you to do anything you don’t want to do—you would do so willingly and out of the goodness of your heart.</p>
<p>If, instead, you are taking the big step of buying your first house or doing your first renovation, you will feel the weight of your decision due to Saturn in your sign and close to Neptune, your ruler. At the same time be comforted knowing that you are preparing for your future security. Helping someone you love in need gives tremendous personal satisfaction.</p>
<p>Pluto, the planet of transformation, will beam Jupiter close to the new moon June 6 in a rare and highly impactful aspect. This indicates that although you may pay more than you intended for your space, your improvements will work out to transform you in positive ways you can’t quite anticipate. It is all part of your personal growth.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind that Jupiter gives you not only the opportunity but also the means to take advantage of that opportunity. For example, you may be buying property that the bank repossessed from someone else, and you may get it at an attractive, much reduced price.</p>
<p>If you feel interest rates are high (and they are), keep in mind that this can be a plus because competition for houses and condos is currently reduced, allowing you to get the home you want more easily than usual, and without the seller increasing his asking price or finding yourself in a bidding war. If you opt for a fixed mortgage, you can always renegotiate when interest rates fall. In another instance, a relative may remember you in their will, and you may inherit a home that you never thought you could afford. Amazing things happen when Jupiter is present.</p>
<p>You may be invited to a wonderful party on the full moon June 21 or over the ensuing weekend—go! Mars will be beautifully conversant with the full moon in Capricorn in your most social sector, and at the same time, Mars will also be friendly to three cosmic bodies in Cancer nestled your house of true love—the Sun, Venus, and Mercury.</p>
<p>Mars’ position suggests you may need to drive a short distance (within 200 miles) to get to the party, but it would be worth going, so do what you have to do to take care of duties at home so you can clear the time to go. You may make a new friend and be so glad you made the effort to attend.</p>
