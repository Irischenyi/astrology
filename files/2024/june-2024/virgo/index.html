        <p>You are going to love the way June unfolds for you. Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, moved into Gemini last month on May 25 and will stay a year in your tenth house of professional honors, awards, and achievement until June 9, 2025. If you want a better position with greater responsibility, influence, and industry respect, you may get your wish in the coming 12 months. Jupiter in your career house will expand everything he touches, including opportunities. As you move forward, you will be prized for your unique talents and will likely find the right role to apply them successfully.</p>
<p>You may need a new moon in your tenth house of career to get the ball rolling, and that only happens once a year. Magically, that necessary moon is precisely the one you will have when the new moon appears in Gemini at 16 degrees on June 6.</p>
<p>This new moon is extraordinary, and she will arrive with her entourage: the Sun (her partner), Venus, Mercury, and Jupiter. The fact that your ruler Mercury is included tells me you will be eager to investigate career offers. The fact that Jupiter is conjunct Mercury tells me even more—this conjunction, in your prestigious house of career, makes this one of the best new moons you’ve seen in years for opening the door to solid job offers.</p>
<p>Gemini is the sign of the Twins, so you may see TWO sterling career offers to choose from as a result of the interviews you will have in the days and weeks that follow this new moon. If you are self-employed, you may bring in not one but two dazzling new clients and be the talk of the industry.</p>

        <p>Venus is also part of the crowd of planets in your prestigious, professional tenth house, and that tells me you will be a popular candidate—liked by clients, VIPs in management, and subordinates, too.</p>
<p>There is more good news from this new moon. Pluto, based in your work-a-day assignment and project sector (sixth house), will be in direct conversation with Jupiter in a heavenly trine, linking work projects you are doing now to Jupiter in your leadership and reputation sector. This means you can generate substantial accolades from the work that you do.</p>
<p>Mercury is ALSO in contact with Pluto in a beautiful trine, so as you see, there are many signs that your job hunt will be met with enthusiasm from prospective employers (or from clients if you own the business). This process of moving ahead might even be enjoyable! Mercury’s presence suggests that your talents in the communication arts, your ability to analyze data, and your fluency with the digital world are what will set you apart.</p>
<blockquote><p>You are about to enter your most exciting career year in over a decade, possibly the best professional year of your life.</p></blockquote>

        <p>This new moon does have one planetary detractor, and that’s Saturn in Pisces, based in your partnership sector. With Saturn in hard (square) angle to the transiting Sun, you will have to work hard if you accept one of the proposals presented to you in the days and weeks that follow the new moon on June 6. Of all the signs, Virgo is rarely ever put off by the prospect of having to burn the midnight oil—you are one of the most industrious of all signs. The need to use each day as productively as possible is the hallmark of your personality.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you might be distracted and feel off balance due to a difficult relationship with your spouse or long-term sweetheart. It is also possible that a business partner, agent, or expert you had hired is not seeing eye to eye with you and is causing you distress. If Saturn is pressing on you in this way, the new job you will be offered will go a long way to validate how well you’ve been doing professionally and give you a moral boost. From now on, give your career your main attention because that is where the golden nuggets are found.</p>
<p>This year, transiting Saturn is currently opposed to your natal Virgo Sun—if your birthday falls within four days of September 7, you are likely feeling the strain. Sometimes health suffers when Saturn is in this position. Ask your doctor for a blood test to see if you are getting sufficient calcium—Saturn opposition your Sun tends to siphon calcium levels. Also visit your dentist more often to check on the condition of your teeth.</p>
<p>Additionally, pay attention to your skin, bones, joints, and especially knees. Finally, with transiting Saturn opposing your natal Virgo Sun, if you have any pain or unusual concern about your gut, see a gastroenterologist (specialist in intestine disorders) because this is often a weak point of the body for Virgo—it is the place tension goes first. Chances are you are fine, but I did want to flag these areas in your health for you to pay attention to.</p>

        <p>If your Virgo birthday falls in August up to September 2, you felt the strongest effect of Saturn’s challenges to health or a relationship last year in 2023.</p>
<p>If your Virgo birthday falls after September 11, your will feel the strongest effect of Saturn opposed to your Sun next year in 2025.</p>
<p>Virgos with birthdays that span September 3 to 11 are feeling the strongest rays from Saturn this year.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is the Virgos born on September 7, plus or minus four days, who will benefit the most from the new moon’s focus on career. (Those born with Virgo rising at 16 degrees, plus or minus four degrees, will also benefit.)</p>
<p>Saturn will completely leave his opposition to your Virgo Sun in February 2026. From then on, you will be free from Saturn’s relationship challenges and possible drain on your health. Saturn won’t be back to his opposing place in Pisces until April 2052.</p>
<p>I started your report with talk of the five-star new moon in Gemini on June 6, but there are two days I would like you to watch before you reach June 6.</p>
<p>On June 2, a Sunday, Jupiter in Gemini will be exactly trine Pluto in Aquarius. This is a heavenly aspect that only happens once this year, and it won’t happen again until September of 2028. This is a day associated with big money deals.</p>

        <p>Both Jupiter and Pluto are outer planets that move along our solar system like little turtles, very slowly. So when these two are together, they are considered a “signature of success.” Best of all, Jupiter and Pluto will be within significant mathematical closeness during the first three weeks of June. This is a great indicator of prosperity, and the way astrology works best is to go out and look for business when you have such golden aspects, like in June. Doors will open for you, dear Virgo.</p>
<p>June 4 is the other day I would like you to circle on your calendar, for that is the day Mercury will conjoin good-fortune Jupiter for the only time this year—in your house of career. This is a fine day to sign a contract, have an interview (you’ll be super articulate), negotiate any situation, hand in an important manuscript, give a speech, judge a contest, take a trip for business or pleasure, or shop for something special.</p>
<p>Last month seems to have been an expensive month due to Mars’ tour of your eighth house, and you may have racked up expenses on your credit card. Fortunately, this heavy spending will tone down once you reach June 8, and Mars leaves this thorny place.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the full moon of June 21, which also will dazzle! This will be the first of two full moons in a row, exactly one month apart, that appear in the same sign and part of your chart—both will light your fifth house of true love. In addition to romance, this house rules your imagination and creativity, pregnancy, birth, and the care of children. Something involving one of these topics is coming to fullness within four days of June 21.</p>

        <p>Most people would be happy with a scintillating career new moon on June 6, but you have love and romance in the picture as well on (and around) June 21. This month, the good news keeps rolling forward. The only little difficulty with this full moon is that Neptune will be in hard aspect—this suggests that you may be in love with love, and if you commit to marriage without knowing your partner well, you may be disappointed later. Take your time—there is no rush.</p>
<p>Love seems to be very much on your mind in June and July, and if you are single, you must circulate more, as you have an open road to meet someone new. Venus will move to Cancer on June 17, before the romantic full moon occurs, and will stay there until July 11—a divinely compatible place for Venus to be for you. Attached couples can have more fun and lavish more attention on one another. Life can’t be about work all the time.</p>
<p>If you hope for a baby, there is a strong emphasis on conception in June and July, so it would be wise to start immediately, as you may see results by the full moon. August will bring Mercury retrograde from August 4 to August 28 in Leo, not as ideal for trying for conception (but still possible). However, if you are already pregnant, don’t worry if your child is born with Mercury retrograde. It makes the child more philosophical and spiritual.</p>
<p>One lovely way of experiencing this full moon in Capricorn (an earth sign, ideal for you) is to finish up a creative project and reveal it to the world. This is very possible to accomplish, as is the possibility that you will, after a long process, hear that you have been awarded a highly coveted creative project to work on. Something good is bubbling up within you, and you will be happy to see the results.</p>

        <p>Virgos who were born within four days of August 22 will be the most favored at the June 21 full moon. If you have Virgo rising 1 degree or have your natal moon at 1 degree, in both cases, plus or minus four degrees, you, too, will partake of the glamorous aspects at play on June 21.</p>
<p>Conversely, if your birthday falls from September 17 to September 21, you will be most affected and made happy NEXT month at the full moon in Capricorn on July 21.</p>
<p>Can you travel in June? Yes! Mars in Taurus will see that you do, and you may go for pleasure or business. If you get a chance to flee town for any reason, take it, for once your career catches fire (which apparently will happen any minute), you will not have a free moment to take off. Have fun and go!</p>
<p>You have so much to be excited about, dear Virgo.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>As a Virgo, you are a reserved, modest soul, and you are not prone to tooting your own horn about your accomplishments. Yet you work harder and smarter than most, getting more done in a day than most people get done in a week. Sometimes you may wonder if anyone has noticed the excellence of your work (or simply taken it for granted). You don’t have to wonder any longer—you are about to enter your most exciting career year in over a decade. In fact, this could turn out to be the best professional year of your life.</p>

        <p>You will start to see glimmerings of career success once you get to the new moon in Gemini on June 6. Jupiter, the planet of good fortune, recently moved into your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement on May 25. He is setting up shop and will remain there for a little over a year, until June 9, 2025. All that time Jupiter will make sure others see and appreciate your work. He will also bring a plethora of opportunities to help you see reward in terms of a better job with more influence and power.</p>
<p>This month’s new moon on June 6 lands in your prestigious career sector (tenth house), and during this time, good-fortune Jupiter will be conjunct Mercury, your guardian planet, whose job is to take good care of you. This makes this new moon perfect for you, and this period could well come laden with career opportunities. With the new moon and Sun will be Jupiter, Mercury, and Venus (signifying popularity with higher-ups and subordinates alike), and all five of these heavenly bodies will be in talkative, fast-moving Gemini.</p>
<p>If professional progress has been too slow for your taste while the planets were in earthy Taurus in May, you will love this change—everything will speed up noticeably.</p>
<p>Gemini is a double-bodied sign of the Twins, so this suggests you may get two serious offers for an advanced position, or if self-employed, two lucrative new clients. Pluto, based in your sixth house of assignments, will send direct support to Jupiter and Mercury, suggesting your project will be well received by VIPs—this project may turn out to be a jewel in your crown that leads you to bigger and better things. The work you do now will be noticed by decision-makers, and your performance will be evaluated again later when promotions are given out in mid-December.</p>

        <p>You’ve been spending more money than usual lately, but that should start to abate once Mars enters Taurus on June 8. At that point, you may be getting ready to travel to an exciting destination. No doubt, you will enjoy being in a new setting, even if simply traveling for work. (If you are sent to a foreign city for work, add more time at the end to allow for exploration over the weekend, and pay for the extra days yourself.) There is a strong chance that you will need your passport to go on those trips—foreign countries will beckon.</p>
<p>The full moon on June 21 will be in the divine-for-you sign of Capricorn, and will light up your fifth house of love, romance, relaxation, sports, and fun. Also included in this area of your chart are matters of pregnancy, birth, and care for children. You may take another trip—this time, go with your spouse or sweetheart. If you have small children, you might ask your mother to babysit so that this trip can be a romantic getaway for the two of you.</p>
<p>Mars is in your travel house, beaming shimmering vibrations to both the Sun and full moon, so a quick trip, complete with pampering, will be a perfect idea. With your career about to go into overdrive, take any chance you get to flee town in your free time in June, and devote yourself to having fun. As the year progresses, travel for pleasure won’t be quite as possible as it is now.</p>
<p>Also at this time, a creative project may be awarded to you. You’ll be excited and happy to work on something this imaginative and to freely apply your own stamp of individuality and stylishness. The full moon in Capricorn June 21 may bring you this project, or you may find yourself finishing it up around this time. Either way, you will be singing a happy tune.</p>
