        <p>June will bring lots of attention to money. In a stroke of luck, good-fortune Jupiter has now settled into your eighth house of other people’s money for the first time in 12 years. Apparently, you are about to do some savvy money management. You may be ready to launch a big dream—buy a house, renovate or fix up a home, go back to college, get married, or take a trip of a lifetime. These types of lifestyle changes often require large sums, so this might describe your situation now.</p>
<p>You have half the solar system crowded in your eighth house, which is naturally ruled by Scorpio. This gives you an inborn talent for making good choices in finding ways to get the most from the money you have and to make it grow. If you have not yet become cognizant of this innate talent, partner with a trustworthy financial advisor and look at your options. If you are ready to make a big purchase, such as real estate, a renovation, a car, or any other large asset, find out the smartest way to go about getting the money you need at the lowest interest rate (while avoiding unnecessary taxes, such as if you have to sell stock and be hit with capital gains).</p>
<p>The new moon on June 6 in Gemini, 16 degrees, will trigger financial talks because this new moon is joined in Gemini by the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and Jupiter. In addition, Pluto will send a beam to Jupiter from your fourth house of home. This is a spectacular trine (heavenly aspect) that will happen exactly on Sunday, June 2.</p>
<p>Both Jupiter and Pluto orbit like little snails, inching their way along their appointed paths, and they will still be in significant mathematical closeness to each other during the new moon on June 6, a fabulously lucky aspect that’s known to bring discussions about large sums of money. Since Jupiter and Pluto will be supremely friendly, there’s a good chance you will get the money you need. If you are looking for a job, the salary and benefits package being offered and negotiated is likely to please you. (Your second house of earned income is ruled by Jupiter, and Jupiter is an active, helpful participant here.)</p>

        <p>This aspect between Jupiter and Pluto, known to generate prosperity and generosity, will only happen once this year, and then not again until one day four-plus years from now on September 24, 2028. Rare aspects like this are generally felt strongly.</p>
<p>Additionally, at the time of the Gemini new moon, Gemini’s ruler Mercury will be orbiting tightly with Jupiter, which is one reason this new moon will be so sensational. Gemini rules your eighth house of other people’s money and also your house of friendship. It seems a friend could be very helpful regarding your search for money. Alternatively, if you are looking for a new job that will pay well, a friend may give you a tip or be willing to recommend you.</p>
<p>Saturn is the only difficult planet during the new moon, and because he is in your sector of children, you may be concerned about the money you need in order to care for your child. Fortunately, Saturn is currently in Pisces, a water sign that will work with you to create stability. If you are a Scorpio born on or near November 7, plus or minus five days, or have Scorpio rising at 16 degrees, plus or minus five degrees, Saturn will work with you, not against you.</p>

        <p>The house of other people’s money rules all kinds of funds that come to you outside of a salary, such as bonuses, cash advances, mortgages or refinanced mortgages, bank loans, venture capital, scholarships, financial aid, student loans, insurance payouts, court settlements, division of property in a divorce or end of a business, inheritances, sales of personal property, taxes, and tax refunds. One of these areas seems to be on your mind. Or it may be that you are interested in investing a sum of money you’ve saved and are ready to talk to your advisor about your options.</p>
<p>The eighth house rules something else—it is the house of surgery. Since the eighth house is the house of transformation, you can think of surgery in this way: The surgeon fixes the part of you that has hurt you, and you come out of the surgery transformed because you are better than before. Dental work also comes under the eighth house, so if your doctor or dentist says you need a treatment, this is a good time to do it. Mercury will retrograde from August 4 to August 28, so it would be best to do it in June. That new moon of June 6 will help you.</p>
<p>Your ruler Mars will be in Taurus from June 8 to July 20, putting extra emphasis on your romantic partner or possibly a business collaborator that you hired (or will hire) to help you.</p>
<p>The seventh house, where Mars will be based, rules one-to-one confidential relationships. This person, such as an accountant, doctor, or lawyer, likely needs to know personal information about you to do their job.</p>
<p>For example, if you are planning a wedding, you might now hire a wedding planner. If you have your own business, you may be looking to hire a crackerjack bookkeeper or publicist. Or you might be looking for an accountant. Professionals are strongly associated with the seventh house, and so is marriage. A contract usually seals the important relationship, whether in business or in your personal life—and of course when you get married you sign papers directly afterward.</p>

        <p>The most common way most people feel activity in the seventh house is to get engaged or married. If you are already married, you and your spouse may want to work together to make more of your marriage, perhaps by choosing a goal to tackle as a couple. Last month this part of your chart was brilliantly lit, so some of these possible outcomes of hosting your ruler Mars in this area of your chart may be familiar.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to the full moon on June 21, which will fall in Capricorn, 1 degree, and light your third house of communication. You may be ready to sign a contract, but if so, be sure you understand the terms of the agreement. Neptune will be in hard angle to that full moon on June 21 (a 90-degree square), so you may fall victim to believing a fantasy over reality regarding the contract. A lawyer can help sort through the language of the contract, explain what it really means, and suggest possible contingencies to prepare for. We all can be guilty of indulging in wishful thinking in life, but if our hopes are not rooted in reality, disappointment can follow, and later, we ask ourselves, “What was I thinking?”</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are working on a creative project that you need to finish up during the full moon on June 21, Mars can be helpful. You may be writing an imaginative novel or screenplay, and in that case, Mars will have the support of Mercury and Venus. These two can give you good ideas for how to compellingly shape your imaginary characters.</p>
<p>With this supportive connection to Venus and Mercury, you might have a writing partner to collaborate with. Your editor might assume that role, pointing out areas where you should sharpen the identity and motives of one or more characters in the story. Or you may be ready to hand in a finished draft or manuscript. You could also be giving a speech or judging a contest.</p>

        <p>There is a completely different way this full moon might affect you—you may decide to travel a short distance (say, under 300 miles) to a mountainous area inland, away from the coast, perhaps passing fields of wildflowers so beautiful that you’ll feel compelled to stop, stare, and snap photos. This is the first of two full moons that will fall in the same area of your chart. Both full moons will influence travel, agreements, and communication skills. The second full moon will light the same area of your chart, for it will be in Capricorn too, but next month (July 21) it will appear at 29 degrees (a degree of completion).</p>
<p>What is the most romantic day of the month? That’s easy: Thursday, June 28, when Venus in Cancer will move toward her lover Mars in Taurus to form a sextile (opportunity aspect).</p>
<p>Venus will be in lovely Cancer from June 17 to July 11—a great time to find love or to celebrate the love you have already found.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Scorpio is known to be shrewd about money management. If you are mumbling to yourself, “yeah, not really,” it means this talent is lying dormant within you. All you need to do is develop it. It might be useful this month to take a class in money management or find a financial advisor with a good track record (ask friends for names).</p>
<p>In early June you appear to be nearly obsessed with taking care of money matters. You may be paying taxes or, conversely, investing your money carefully in stocks and bonds with the help of an advisor. You may be setting up a trust or health proxy, or this work could involve estate planning, including a will. The June 6 new moon in Gemini is a superb time to assess and address these matters.</p>

        <p>The new moon on June 6 will be joined by the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and best of all, good-fortune Jupiter—all in your eighth house of other people’s money. You may be putting in an application for a loan or mortgage, or you may win a contest or charity raffle. You could also be given a large commission, bonus, royalty, or infusion of venture capital. You may be pleased with an insurance payout or a valuable gift of cash, jewelry, a painting, or some other piece of art. You may have your eye on a very large sum of cash so you can start your own business or do a major home renovation.</p>
<p>As you see, money might go out, but money will come in to you, too. Jupiter’s rare and friendly interaction with Pluto on June 2 (and close enough in degree for three weeks thereafter) is a sure signal that your finances are looking up. When good financial news arrives, it might feel very exciting and random, but in truth, it’s because your past work is paying off. However, at the time it happens, it may all feel like a miracle.</p>
<p>Saturn is in your fifth house, so you may be concerned about the care for one of your children—specifically, how much childcare will cost. You want to provide the best for your child but may be unsure if you can afford to do so. You may be worrying too much—Jupiter recently entered your financial eighth house (the area that is so lit up for you), suggesting that you are entering into one of the best financial years of your life.</p>
<p>If you are in sales, you will have a banner year, but Scorpios of every occupation will do well. It all started last month on May 25 and will extend to next year until June 9, 2025. If you are self-employed, you can now bring in prestigious lucrative clients for your goods or services.</p>

        <p>Not only will money come to you through your work but also through specialized government programs, corporate grants, family gifts, an inheritance, or insurance payouts. If you do some research, it could pay off, because you have the kind of aspects that suggest that kind of luck.</p>
<p>The eighth house, as the house of transformation, also rules surgery and dental work, for the surgeon removes the part of you that has hurt you, and hopefully (and likely), you emerge better after the procedure. With Jupiter, the great healer, in your eighth house, you might want to do any procedures prior to Jupiter’s exit next year on June 9, 2025. The sooner you address the situation the better.</p>
<p>Let’s now turn to your work life, which was demanding in April and May. Your workload will lighten a bit after your ruler Mars leaves Aries on June 8. After that, you will have more time for your spouse or sweetheart and your children, too. You also might be thinking about hiring a high-level professional to help you get ahead in your career, such as an agent, business partner, manager, bookkeeper, accountant, lawyer, headhunter, doctor, or other specialized professional who will work with you in a confidential one-on-one way. Between June 8 and July 20, you will find qualified individuals if you look for them.</p>
<p>After focusing so much on money matters, you will be ready to enjoy nature at the full moon on June 21. You will need a change whether you go near or far—it’s your choice. The full moon is in earthy Capricorn, so go to a gorgeous mountainous area with beautiful views of nature and many wildflowers.</p>
<p>Before you go on your trip, you may need to put your signature on a contract, but have your lawyer look at it first (always a wise move). If you sign early in the month, you might misread the contract and not see areas you need to correct. You can sign any time this month, but your best day will be June 26 when Mercury (agreements) and Saturn (longevity) will be in sync.</p>
