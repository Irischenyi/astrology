        <p>Your chart in June, and in weeks and months beyond this month, will have a soft, lyrical quality. The universe is being clear: It’s time for you to turn away from career interests in favor of giving your personal life new luster. For the first time in over a decade, the good fortune planet Jupiter has entered Gemini and your fifth house of true love, last month on May 25, and is planning to stay for over a year until June 9, 2025. At long last, a rich, affectionate, loving personal life is within reach. Aquarians of every marital status will be included in this sensational trend.</p>
<p>The new moon June 6 in Gemini, 16 degrees, will trigger the welcoming warming change in mood and tempo. If you’re single, you will have a superb chance to meet someone new in the coming year of Jupiter’s stay in Gemini. If you felt life was bumbling along too slowly and not bringing the progress you had expected, you will enthusiastically embrace the changes that are on their way to you. Last month you had to deal with many planets in Taurus, an earth sign that can feel smothering to your light and breezy Aquarius air-sign. Gemini, your fifth house of true love, is classified as the same element a your sign, air, so you will absorb Jupiter’s goodness in Gemini easily. Also, everything Gemini does is fast, like the wind. If you make an effort to find love this month or to move closer to your partner, you should be rewarded.</p>
<p>Last month was a good month, especially if you were working to make your home more beautiful and a healthier place to live. (Alternatively, you may have been trying to help a parent.) Now that you’ve feathered your nest, it’s time to invite love in. If you are married or seriously dating, you will have more time to enjoy each other, with fewer distractions from the outside world. You may decide on a goal you can to do together, such as to take a grand trip overseas. Alternatively, perhaps you feel it’s time to have a baby. Whatever you wish for in your personal life, the universe is listening.</p>
<p>There will be additional bonuses to this new moon, but first let’s look at some of the other planets because their aspects will affect how you can react to the opportunities that come up as a result of the new moon June 6.</p>

        <p>The new moon will arrive June 6 with the Sun, and whatever sector the Sun transits indicates where you will shine—this month it’s love! Also in the moon’s entourage will be Venus, planet of love; Mercury, planet of communication, a bedrock of any solid relationship; and Jupiter, the good luck planet. Mercury also is the ruler of your truelove sector. All will be in the divine-for-you sign of Gemini. Amazingly, Mercury will conjoin Jupiter on June 4 (a great day to sign a contact or make a promise). Mercury and Jupiter will still be close enough to each other two days later on the new moon on June 6. This is fantastic for helping you find love or enjoy the love you’ve already found.</p>
<p>Venus will be conjunct the Sun and new moon, another signal that Cupid and his little fleet of angels will be buzzing around you, ready to zing their tiny arrows at a moment’s notice. If you are single, you are likely to meet an intriguing person at a party, even a party you might give in your own home (ask friends to bring a person they would like you to meet, someone you don’t already know).</p>
<p>When the ancients developed the horoscope wheel, they included pregnancy, birth, and the care of children in the fifth house, which is so lit up for you. If you want a child, this is the very best time to get serious about focusing on that goal. While you will have a full year of Jupiter in this love -and children-oriented house, you have other planets here now, which will soon leave. Venus moved into Gemini (so perfect for you) on May 23 and will remain until to June 17—the same day Mercury will leave Gemini. The Sun will leave Gemini on June 20. Beginning with the new moon, you have a very crowded house of true love! Use it early in the month—as soon as that new moon arrives June 6.</p>
<blockquote><p>Love is in the air, and very soon you will see the truth of this. Be optimistic.</p></blockquote>

        <p>It is true that a new moon will affect you for nearly six months, however, it’s strongest just after it appears. It then very gradually declines in power until the new moon has spent all her energy by when the full moon in the same sign appears six months later, in this case Gemini, due December 15.</p>
<p>Jupiter will stay on much longer, until next year, June 9, 2025, and fortunately, just before Jupiter leaves, there will be another new moon in your truelove sector, but it will not be as spectacular as the one this year on June 6. As you see, I want you to strike while the iron is hot—now! Start circulating!</p>
<p>You have another five-star aspect at the time of the new moon. Powerhouse Pluto in Aquarius will reach out to Jupiter in Gemini, a very rare aspect that only happens once this year and will not again happen until September 2028. Technically, they will reach a perfect aspect on June 2, but you will feel this aspect longer because both are outer planets that move like little snails across the night sky. In fact they will remain close for the first three weeks of June, and they will help the creative Aquarians who are trying to sell an important imaginative project for a solidly good price. This aspect is considered a signature of financial success. Of course, June 2 is your best day to take advantage of this aspect.</p>
<p>As said, Jupiter is now in your fifth house, which rules more than love and romance and children and pregnancy—it also rules artistic expression. You may get a new project that has enormous potential to be a blockbuster and bring in major money. Gemini is the sign of the Twins, so you may get approval on TWO projects.</p>

        <p>This really is a near-perfect new moon, however, there will be one thorny side to it. Saturn will be square the Sun and new moon from your house of income. There are many ways this could work out. You may be worried about the cost of attending (or giving) a beautiful event and need to scale back. Or you may want to do something special for your child but are concerned about the cost, such as if you are about to send your child to overnight camp or a new school when classes resume. Saturn has been making you very cost-conscious ever since March 2023 when he entered your second house of earned income. Saturn will remain in your salary and savings sector until February 2026.</p>
<p>Everyone of every sign gets this aspect every 29 years—you are in the process of being done with it! The good part is that you will eliminate waste, get more value from your money, negotiate more effectively, and be motivated to find new sources of income. If the expenditure is important to you, you will find the money to do it.</p>
<p>Now let’s talk about your home, which you seem to have been nearly obsessed about over the past year. Jupiter was visiting your home sector from May 2023 to May 2024, so you may have moved, renovated, refreshed your décor, made repairs, landscaped your property, or done other things to make your living experience quite wonderful. Alternatively, you may have been very focused on your mother or father and tried to be of assistance. That may have included finding an assisted living facility for an aging parent or simply helping box things up for them if they were moving to a new address. Or you may have found a new specialist to help your mother or father with a certain health concern.</p>
<p>If you are saying, “Wait! I am not finished! I have more to do on my apartment or to help my father! I lost Jupiter? Oh no!” Don’t be one bit concerned, dear Aquarius.</p>

        <p>First, the new moon of last month, May 7, was very favorable to help you advance home -and family-related ventures. Most of the planets in that home-oriented area of your chart have since migrated to your truelove, children, and creativity center, but even so, you will be given a second chance to finish up your plan.</p>
<p>Mars is heading straight into your home and family sector when Mars enters Taurus on June 8 to stay until July 20. Mars is a high-octane, get-things-moving planet! Mars’ little brother Mercury will retrograde soon after Mars leaves Taurus on July 20. (Mercury will retrograde August 4 to August 28, and you may want to stay away from those dates for purchasing expensive items for your home.) You will make your greatest progress if you act before the Mercury retrograde. Aim to get all your home -and family-related goals finished from June 8 to July 20 while everything will be working in your favor.</p>
<p>The full moon this month, June 21, will be in Capricorn, 1 degree, to fill your twelfth house. It will be a time of rest. Ironically, this will be the first of two consecutive full moons in Capricorn, the next one will occur on July 21, exactly one month later.</p>
<p>Neptune will be in hard angle to this month’s full moon, June 21. Something seems unclear—I’m not sure if this is referring to a contract you are signing or medical tests that have come back without a clear picture. Neptune is in your financial house, so you will need to keep reading your bank statements closely to make sure there are no unauthorized withdrawals or banking errors on your account. Simply by being alert, you will be able to dismiss any problems in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Rest and recharge at the full moon June 21 for you have lots happening in your chart. The best part is that love is in the air, and very soon you will see the truth of this. Be optimistic.</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>This will be an exciting month, for the new moon of June 6 will open the door to a rich emotional life for weeks and months to come. The new moon will appear in your fifth house of true love, fun, and romance. This same area of your chart also covers pregnancy, birth, and the care of children. Not interested in having children? The fifth house also encourages your imagination and your artistic expression. A beautiful and rare month is about to unfurl before your eyes.</p>
<p>While you always get a new moon in this romantic, loving area of your chart once a year, this year is special because of the presence of Jupiter, the great planet of good fortune, in your truelove sector, along with Venus (love) and Mercury (news). The fact that Mercury is the natural ruler of your solar fifth house of true love and is conjunct Jupiter is the frosting on the cake.</p>
<p>Last month Jupiter entered your tender house of romance on May 25 and will remain there until next year, June 9, 2025. Jupiter takes 12 years to circle the Sun and to visit all 12 signs of the zodiac, so it’s been a dozen years since you’ve had Jupiter’s magical, enchanting luck in matters of the heart.</p>
<p>If you are single, this is fantastic news, for finally you stand an excellent chance of meeting your one truelove. Singles are more likely to meet in a party setting, whether attending a friend’s soirée or one you give in your home. If you are married, you can count on getting more attention from your partner, and you will enjoy growth and a new closeness in your relationship.</p>

        <p>Single or married, if you want children, Jupiter will make it easier to conceive. If you are not ready, be careful, or you will be knitting baby booties very soon, especially due to the new moon in Gemini June 6 and the days that follow. Additionally, Gemini is the sign of the Twins—do you have any in your family? You may be the first to welcome two tiny babies.</p>
<p>You have another reason to be excited about Jupiter in Gemini—it is an air sign, which blends well with Aquarius, as you are an air sign, too. The benefits of having Jupiter “trine” (great harmony) to your Sun cannot be overstated. You have a strong chance of traveling to a distant city with your one-and-only this year, and it is most likely to be a city overseas, to a fascinating place you always wanted to see but were never sure you actually would go.</p>
<p>It is fortunate that Jupiter is coming to help you now, AFTER Saturn had tested you while in Aquarius from March 2020 to March 2023. Those may have been tough years, as Saturn demands a great deal of concentration to cosmic tests that he gives to the exclusion of nearly everything else. You are finished with Saturn in Aquarius, and you will not have to revisit Saturn’s bootcamp again until 2050 to 2053.</p>
<p>Subsequent visits of Saturn will be easier, for, theoretically, you have already mastered a great many of life’s lessons from the most recent visit of this cosmic teacher and will have less to learn when he returns. Today, you find yourself leaner, stronger, more mature, confident, and ready for a genuine love relationship.</p>

        <p>Starting June 8, when Mars will enter Taurus, you will get a second chance to return your attention to matters related to your home or to other property you may own or rent (your first was the previous year when Jupiter was in Taurus). Alternatively, you may direct this energy to help one of your relatives, such as your mother, father, or another close kin like your sister or niece, who may have recently welcomed a new baby to the family.</p>
<p>You have been focused on this home area of your life for a long time and perhaps are feeling pride from the improvements and accomplishments you’ve made to beautify your home or the assistance you lovingly gave to your family. If you have anything left to do in regard to home or family, you can be highly productive while Mars remains in Taurus, June 8 to July 20.</p>
<p>By the full moon June 21, you’ll want privacy and rest. The full moon will appear in your twelfth house, so if you feel like hiding away from the bustling world, go ahead, for that sounds like a very good idea, indeed.</p>
