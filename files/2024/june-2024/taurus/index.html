        <p>As you enter June, you find yourself in a new chapter in life. You have just ended your Emerald Year of great opportunity, brought to you by Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck in a rare, once-in-12-year visit that began in May 2023 and ended last month on May 25, 2024.</p>
<p>During that year, you were busy planting seeds. Now you will see those seeds grow to harvest—expect a bumper crop to show up beginning this month and continue to produce profit from those seeds you planted in the past 12 months for an entire year, until Jupiter leaves on June 9, 2025.</p>
<p>Your chart is simply remarkable. You have a packed second house of earned income, suggesting that if you search for a new source of income this month, you are likely to hit on a good one. As a matter of fact, you have five(!) heavenly bodies in your financial house—the Sun and new moon to bring opportunity; Venus, ruling Taurus and your work project house; Mercury, sure to bring news regarding salary and also creativity; and best of all, Jupiter, the great good-fortune planet.</p>
<p>I am especially excited to see that Jupiter will be conjunct Mercury on June 4, a very good sign that you could hit a financial victory. These planets are all in Gemini, so if you are looking for a new source of income (whether employed by others or self-employed), you will be likely to find two sources because Gemini is the sign of the Twins. In other words, Gemini is a double-bodied signs, so Jupiter in Gemini would tend to bring two of nearly everything.</p>

        <p>Remarkably, you have Jupiter in Gemini in fine angle to powerhouse Pluto in Aquarius, an exceedingly rare aspect that will happen June 2. Both are considered big-time financial planets, and both are associated with mega-growth when in this type of aspect. Even better, Jupiter is in your salary and earned income sector, and Pluto is in your career house of fame (Pluto recently moved to this sign for the for the first time in your lifetime). This is headline news.</p>
<p>Mercury rules your second house of earned income, and with Mercury conjunct Jupiter in this very same house of your chart, your chances to make good money have never been better.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, while the entire year will be financially fruitful for you, this is one of your best months ever to see an increase in salary. This month, watch the days near June 2, and then the ones that follow the new moon June 6.</p>
<p>Later in the year, watch mid-December (near the full moon December 15), and after that, and looking ahead, circle January 29, 2025, when a new moon should help you scale new heights in your career. You may hear good financial development news coming after the new moon next year on May 27, 2025.</p>
<blockquote><p>You stand to see the best, most lucrative financial year you have had in the past decade, and possibly, you may see the best financial year of your life.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Whenever I tell someone that they are due for some solid opportunity in earnings, half the people ask, smiling and often laughing, if that means they could win a fortune gambling or from having winning lotto tickets. No, it does not. To me, their question is a red flag, suggesting that the person does not want to work to earn money but to sit back and buy a lottery ticket and let the money roll in. You are not like those people. You know that the greatest pride in life and sense of accomplishment comes from hard work, wise decisions, perseverance, and consistency. These are Taurus traits, and they will come in handy now.</p>
<p>If you have to sign a legal agreement this month, you are fortunate that you have one of the best aspects to do so when Jupiter conjoins Mercury on June 4, a perfect day to sign. This won’t happen again in your financial house for many years—this day has the power to be excellent.</p>
<p>The new moon June 6 does have one drawback in that Saturn will be in hard angle to the new moon, so you may have to work hard to get what you want, but that has never deterred you. Or, instead, it may mean that you are giving up something in the immediate to get to your goal that will be in place over the long-term. Life is all about priorities, and what we value most goes to the top of the list.</p>
<p>You have another big advantage this month when Mars enters Taurus for the first time in two years. Having Mars in your sign is always a great competitive advantage because Mars will amplify up your courage, persistence, drive, and persuasive powers. Mars will also make you more attractive, so even romantically you will be more magnetic and compelling and will easily draw others to you. You are starting an entire new chapter in your life now, which has to be exciting.</p>
<p>The full moon of June 21 in Capricorn this month is unusual in that we will have another full moon exactly one later on July 21 also in Capricorn. The difference is that the one coming this month will mostly touch those Taurus who were born April 20-24 (or who have Taurus rising 0 to 5 degrees), and next month, those Taurus who were born May 15 to May 19, or have Taurus rising 25 to 29 degrees, will be the most affected.</p>

        <p>Let’s concentrate on this month—a full moon in Capricorn, 1 degree. During your Emerald Year, which just ended, Jupiter was urging you to go to a foreign country to expand your view and knowledge of the world. You might have purchased a ticket previously and are getting ready to go this month, perhaps returning on June 21. (Full moons bring a finish or ending.)</p>
<p>This full moon of June 21 should bring joy. Venus is your ruler and guardian planet. Shortly after Venus moves into highly compatible Cancer (June 17), Venus will partner with the full moon in Capricorn to exact degree. At the same time, Venus will conjunct the Sun, another lovely aspect. Venus will put an extra spotlight on social graces, ease, and harmony. Venus will also boost your finances, and Mars will be close enough (right on the borderline of significance) to help you have lots of fun.</p>
<p>If you cannot travel, you may take college courses or a test to be admitted into the institution of your choice. You might have a legal matter pending, and if so, this full moon will do all it can to help you see a favorable resolution. If you are inclined not to go to a jury trial, try arbitration, but even if you are already in court, the verdict, if due within days of June 21, should please you. This full moon could, alternatively, bring a media project with you as reporter, writer, or producer or, instead, as the subject of a story.</p>
<p>All of these possibilities could come up. Although in life we usually see only one, it is possible you would have several of these outcomes. With three celestial planets in your short-distance travel sector and the full moon in your ninth house of long-distance travel, I feel there is a good possibility that you will be at the airport, railroad station, or in your car heading to a lush mountainous area, or one with fields of grain or wild flowers and plenty of sunshine.</p>

        <p>One last word: On June 29, Saturn is due to go retrograde in Pisces, 19 degrees, until November 15, when Saturn will have fallen back to 13 degrees. This will weaken the stern effects of Saturn somewhat and at the same time open up your social life. You may have fewer duties and more time for fun. Venus is in the divine-for-you sign of Cancer, and with Mars in Taurus, you will be quite the dazzler. Enjoy your time in the spotlight, dear Taurus.</p>
<p>On the same day, June 29, Mercury will be in direct harmony with Uranus (a sextile). It will be as if Mercury poked the piñata and showered you with surprises, all of them special. See what happens—even one happy surprise will have you singing a happy tune.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, moved into Taurus in May 2023 in a rare, once-in-12-year visit. You have likely enjoyed lucky breaks and an expanded view of life, and you may have traveled to a foreign country that you’ve never visited before during you sparkling Emerald Year. If not, that trip of a lifetime could take place this month—or next, in July.</p>
<p>Jupiter said good-bye to your sign, dear Taurus, last month on May 25 when he moved to Gemini. Now the second gestation of the major cycle that started last year begins. You stand to see the best, most lucrative financial year you have had in the past decade, and possibly, you may see the best financial year of your life.</p>
<p>You might not have to wait long to see your harvest materialize for all the hard work you already put in last year to open new opportunities. First, watch June 2, when Jupiter and Pluto combine forces to create a powerful financial vibration. You might be able to take full advantage of this—Pluto has newly arrived in your career sector (for the first time in your life), and with the boost from Jupiter, you may be starting a new job, getting a promotion, or be able to bring in a prestigious, generous new client.</p>

        <p>You need a new moon to unlock the best financial openings for you, and that’s exactly what you will have—a brilliant new moon on June 6 to open generous, economic opportunities this month. With a new moon in Gemini, the sign of the Twins, you are likely to see get two profitable possibilities or victories.</p>
<p>At the new moon June 6, you have impressive star-power in your second house of possessions and earned income. Accompanying this new moon in Gemini will be the Sun, Mercury, your ruler Venus, newsy Mercury, and good-fortune Jupiter. Jupiter will conjoin Mercury, the planet that rules your income sector, on June 4, a fine day to sign a contract if you hope to make profits from the venture. Rarely have you ever seen a month this remarkable for money.</p>
<p>To add fuel to your burgeoning ascent to a higher status in your community (or industry) is action-oriented Mars, which has been in the wings helping you prepare for your next chapter, starting up now. Mars will move into Taurus on June 8, to stay until July 20, and put you in the driver’s seat. You will have control over events, so take the reins and proceed swiftly forward. Use the six weeks Mars will be with you to full advantage. You will be persuasive, energetic, and courageous with a certain presence that will make people admire you and want to rally around you.</p>
<p>Although you have some of the finest aspects possible, the new moon will have pressure from Saturn, and it is clear you will have to work hard. With all special astrological aspects, you have to partner with the universe and be willing to show how dearly you want to see a fine outcome. If you respond to Saturn’s dictates, you will make great progress and should start to see money come in.</p>

        <p>Concentrate on your financial goals, because if you do, you will continue to make good money all the way into June 2025 and establish yourself on a new and higher income level. This does not mean you will suddenly see a precipitous drop after June 2025—you now have many chances to elevate your career and continue to be paid well from the ventures and through deals you make with clients during the entire coming decade. The harder you worked to plant seeds during the past 12 months, the greater the success you will enjoy now and in coming months.</p>
<p>If you are ready to sign a contract this month, do so in June 4 when Mercury aligns with Jupiter—this will be as good as it gets. If possible do a joint signing with both parties present for even greater luck. If you hope to make a profit from this deal, your stars are twinkling above you, boosting your prospects for a lucrative result.</p>
<p>If June 4 is too early for you to be ready to go through the contract, your second good day will be June 26 when Mercury receives a friendly beam from Saturn, the planet of stability, security, and longevity. Be sure you like the terms, because if you sign on June 26, you would be in this contact a long time.</p>
<p>After all the financial maneuvering this month, you might be ready to take a break. The full moon on Friday June 21 in Capricorn—a fellow earth sign that blends beautifully with yours—will help you pack and go. Neptune, the planet that rules the sea and all water, might bring stormy, rainy weather on one or two days because Neptune will be in hard angle to both the Sun in Cancer and full moon in Capricorn. Even so, Mars, the energy planet in Taurus will send a brilliant beam to the full moon and Sun and make you determined to go. Choose a tiny cottage in the mountains with a fireplace—rain won’t ruffle you one bit. Listening to the rain hitting the roof while sitting next to the fire may make you feel deliciously calm and refreshed—the weather may turn out to be just your cup of tea.</p>

        <p>Are you single and have found a new love interest who you have been chatting with by phone but have not yet met? Choose Friday, June 28, when Venus will be in Cancer and Mars will be in Taurus, a sexy vibration that will set the stage for a perfect first meeting. Choose a charming pastry shop, and let things unfold from there.</p>
<p>Mercury and Uranus will be in perfect sync the following day, June 29, encouraging conversation to bubble up—you’ll likely be eager to meet again. At least one happy surprise should have you beaming.</p>
