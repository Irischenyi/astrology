        <p>You have a thrilling period ahead, dear Leo. You have been working hard, and over the past 12 months, you have made impressive career progress. In May 2023, Jupiter, the good fortune planet, set up residence in Taurus, your tenth house of professional honors, awards, and achievement, and he just left this sector on May 25, 2024. In that time, you may have received a promotion or new job or found your true calling in life.</p>
<p>It took Jupiter 12 years to make the journey to your lofty career sector, which is called the midheaven, and is found at the pinnacle of your horoscope. Jupiter brings luck, possibility, and growth, and he was working hard to give you every possible career opportunity to make a name for yourself. Jupiter likes to expand your perspective and expose you to other cultures, so you may have been asked to travel to a foreign country for business that you found very insightful and expansive.</p>
<p>Astrology works best when you act in harmony with the universe. There is no predestination, so when I tell you one part of your chart is lit up and glowing, that’s a signal to put extra effort in that area because you are likely to see amazing results. You need to show the universe your intent and demonstrate the wish you are holding in your heart is so strong that you are willing to exert yourself to make it happen. If you do, the universe will take you the rest of the way.</p>
<p>Benefic Jupiter has now moved to his new home in Gemini, your eleventh house of joy. This is one of the sweetest parts of your chart—the point where a dearly desired wish receives a chance to materialize. This house also covers your friendships, and with so many celestial bodies crowded into this sector during the first week of June (the June 6 new moon, the Sun, Mercury, Venus, and Jupiter), you will soon see that many new faces will begin to pour into your life.</p>

        <p>Your social life should begin to move into a higher gear, and you’ll have many more reasons to leave your house and mix and mingle with others. If you are tired of spending so many days at the office (or other workplace), this will change, dear Leo. Jupiter will see to it that you get an entire year of rich, happy experiences.</p>
<p>Although your eleventh house rules platonic (friendship) relationships (and you are likely to make at least one or two new close pals), it is very common for an important planet like Jupiter to zing its energy straight across the night sky to the house on the opposite side of your chart, standing 180 degrees away. In your case, the sector set to receive Jupiter’s bountiful rays is your fifth house of true love.</p>
<p>So among the new faces you will encounter over the coming months, there might be someone whose chemistry mixes perfectly with yours, and this will be a person you will want to see again and get to know better romantically. If you are already attached, you will have more time for your sweetheart, and you may even be able to plan an exciting overseas trip. If you hope for a baby, this could also be possible in the glorious year you have unfurling in front of you.</p>
<blockquote><p>You have become a success machine, headed straight to the summit.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Your eleventh house is also the area where, if you’re self-employed, you will see the fruits of the previous year’s labors. You could receive a bountiful crop, and these profits will likely stem from the work you did to seed the market over the past 12 months. Indeed, all the gains you enjoy will emanate directly from your efforts from the past year.</p>
<p>If you are saying, “Hang on a minute, Susan. I didn’t know that last year was my big career year. I am not done climbing my professional ladder—I want success!” Then I say you will have a second chance this month and next to prove your mettle. It looks like you will get your cake and eat it too (social fun AND career progress). Now I will tell you why I am so optimistic about you achieving more victories in your legendary career progress.</p>
<p>Mars, the action planet, will energize Taurus, your lofty tenth house of honors, awards, and achievements—the place in your chart where you can elevate your present position to take on a better one. This will occur from June 8 to July 20. You are on a roll, and there is no stopping you.</p>
<p>You may make a sudden professional victory next month when Mars conjoins Uranus in Taurus, your professional tenth house, on July 15. At the same time, Mars and Uranus will be in sweet angle to Venus, and Venus rules your tenth house of fame and accomplishment. Keep working toward your goals, dear Leo—you are closer to success than you think.</p>
<p>The full moon on June 21 this month will be at 1 degree Capricorn, a critical and highly energized point. It seems a major task is finishing up and getting ready to ship. This is the first of two full moons that will fall in the same sign and sector—Capricorn, your sixth house of work and service. (This is unusual, but it does happen from time to time.) This will put a strong spotlight on your workplace, the team you are collaborating with (and the people who report to you), and the assignments coming in. Next month’s full moon in Capricorn will be at 29 degrees (the degree of completion) and will arrive on July 21, exactly one month after this first full moon.</p>

        <p>Neptune will be in hard angle to the full moon on June 21, so as you get closer to this lunation, make sure you are clear about what the client wants you to achieve because there could be some miscommunication involved that causes backtracking and the potential for extra expense.</p>
<p>Your sixth house, which is where the next two full moons will fall, also rules your physical body and, more specifically, the preventative measures you take to stay strong and healthy. If you are having medical screenings done and the tests come back with odd results, Neptune may be the culprit. If possible, ask for the process to be repeated, or get a second opinion.</p>
<p>Romantically, you will enjoy having so many planets stacked up in Gemini, your eleventh house, and with Venus in Gemini until June 17, socialize as much as you’d like until the middle of the month—later on your work life will likely become more active and distract you from having fun.</p>
<p>Your most productive months will be June and July because Mercury will go retrograde from August 4 to August 28. That will be a time to pull back, relax, and yes, also see friends. Take your vacation in August because nothing earth shattering will happen at work while you are away.</p>

        <p>Now let’s turn to the three special days that are due to occur this month.</p>
<p>On June 2, Jupiter in your friendship sector will make a lovely aspect to powerhouse Pluto in your partnership sector. This will help you forge an important new relationship, possibly in business, because both planets are strongly associated with large budgets and financial growth. A pal may make an introduction that works out very well for you.</p>
<p>Speaking of money, watch June 4 as a potentially great day to seal a big money deal. Mercury will be conjunct Jupiter, which is an ideal aspect for signing papers with a fine profitable result.</p>
<p>Finally, near the end of month on June 29, you have a lovely aspect—Mercury sextile Uranus. This is a day when your mind will be lit with 100,000 points of light and you can come up with ideas of such originality that VIPs will vie for you to be in their corner. Mercury rules your salary house, so do well, and you should be paid generously, too.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You’ve been going through an exciting time in your career, so now that it’s June, you may be keen to see results from your efforts—and you will. June 2 will bring a rare and important interplay between Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, and financial heavyweight Pluto—this could turn out to be quite a lucrative day. This is a Sunday, and these are very slow-moving planets, so watch the days that quickly follow. June 3 and June 4 will be lucky, too.</p>

        <p>I am splitting hairs here because Jupiter and Pluto will remain within significant mathematical closeness during the first three weeks of June. It’s a special month.</p>
<p>Once Mars reaches Taurus on June 8, to stay until July 20, you will again be in the public eye, and your professional profile will be sky-high. You will find it easier than ever to see C-suite VIPs, so if you have an idea to sell or an interview to complete to capture a major job, do so during the period that Mars will be in Taurus. You may also enjoy admirable publicity in the press or be asked to give a speech at an esteemed industry function.</p>
<p>After the new moon on June 6, friends will play a very large role in your life. This new moon will arrive with her partner the Sun (your ruler), along with Venus (popularity), Mercury, which rules your money sector, and best of all Jupiter (the giver of gifts and luck)—all together in chatty, breezy Gemini. Friends may make introductions, offer you tips and advice, and also be willing to give you a recommendation if you need one. Consider joining a club or charity—you will meet like-minded people, and among them, you could make one or two new friends who you will find quite enjoyable, warm, and generous. They will be helpful to you in your efforts to advance.</p>
<p>With Jupiter in this area (your eleventh house, which Jupiter entered on May 25), some of the people you meet will be successful, self-made individuals who will want to share their dreams with you. Your new pals will also want to learn about your goals and urge you to think big—panoramically, in the round. When you hear talk like this, this is evidence that Jupiter is speaking to you. If you know what you want to do but can’t quite figure out how to get started, your friends will have ideas for you—following their advice could lead to a breakthrough.</p>

        <p>Don’t overlook the power of seminars, conferences, conventions, and post-college refresher classes to grow your skills and meet people in your industry who are on the fast-track to success. If you want to learn about new laws, emerging technologies, methods, and resources in your industry, or would like to brush up on your managerial and leadership skills, then sign up for a course. Your eleventh house, which is so lit up for you, rules groups, and any time people gather for a common purpose, that’s a group—and an eleventh house activity, pertinent here, is all about joining in with others.</p>
<p>Money seems to be tight lately because you have Saturn in Pisces, your eighth house of other people’s money. This suggests that lenders would want you to prove your creditworthiness and also require a lot of paperwork. Make sure the income and other financial sums you put into your applications are accurate to avoid any shadow of a doubt about your forthrightness. You might find the terms for any loan, insurance payout, new mortgage, or other financial dealing to be complicated and possibly confusing.</p>
<p>It will be important to ask questions to untangle any provisions you don’t quite understand before formally entering into an agreement. That sounds obvious, but with Saturn orbiting next to Neptune this year, you can’t be too careful with financial ventures.</p>
<p>Here is the good news: Saturn is due to turn retrograde, and this will weaken Saturn’s well-known tough side, which in your case applies to your finances. Saturn will retrograde on June 29 and go direct later this year on November 15.</p>
<p>You seem to have a big project to finish within five days of the full moon on June 21 in Capricorn. Again, Neptune will send scrambled rays to this full moon, suggesting that the amount of money you will be paid—either as a fee, loan, or commission—will be unclear. Even so, your project will impress the powers at the top because Mars, still at the pinnacle of your chart (your tenth house of prestigious professional advancement), will create a direct (albeit wide) link to this full moon. If anyone told you that you would never make it to the top, they will be sorry now. You have become a success machine, headed straight to the summit.</p>
