        <p>This is the beginning of your Emerald Year, dear Gemini. Just a few days ago, on May 25, the good fortune planet Jupiter moved into Gemini for a stay of twelve and a half glorious months until next year, June 9, 2025. You’ve waited more than a decade to have this benefic planet come visit you. In truth, if you live to 96, you will only get eight such visits from Jupiter in your lifetime, so this coming period will be mighty special.</p>
<p>Jupiter expands everything it touches, a little like Miracle Gro® on plants. Jupiter will expand your opportunities and friendships, improve your health, increase your knowledge of the world around you, and he could easily expand your love life to help you meet the one truelove for you. If you are attached, your love will deepen as you move to make more of your relationship and set an exciting new goal. You are also likely to travel abroad on at least one important trip to a location you’ve never been to and always hoped to see. The rewards of Jupiter will extend to you if you have Gemini rising too—treat your ascendant (rising sign) the same as your Sun sign.</p>
<p>If you are saying, “Hmm, life has been a little dull lately,” that may have been because in May, many planets were touring earth signs. You are an air sign, and earth is heavy and can suffocate air. Even though last month, May, was a solidly friendly month, you may not have been able to have accessed the full benefit from the happy planets for that reason.</p>
<p>Those earth planets in Taurus were in your twelfth house, a very secret, hidden part of the chart. VIPs were likely saying flattering things about you in closed-door meetings, but you may not have known about it—eventually you will. Last month, on May 25, Jupiter moved into easy, breezy air-sign Gemini. Life will brighten very shortly, and your plans will move very quickly after the new moon arrives in Gemini on June 6. (More about that in a minute.)</p>

        <p>You need to have your priorities in order first because you will be offered many opportunities in the coming year, and you will need to choose the ones that have the longest growth potential—and hopefully, they will also be opportunities that will feed your soul. If you aren’t choosy, you may spread yourself too thin and not see the true benefit from any of the new positions or ventures you enter.</p>
<p>You are starting a new cycle, and the seeds you plant now will have the power to carry you forward through the coming decade or more with profits if you play your cards right. Next year, June 9, 2025, to June 30, 2026, will bring the best financial year you’ve seen in decades. You will have quite a bountiful harvest to sow from the proposals, deals, and enterprises you seed now and for a full year.</p>
<p>Your part in this trend is to be willing to look for opportunities and to clearly show the universe your passion and drive. (The universe cannot give you what you want if you are not clear about what that is!) I like to say that if you wait for the phone to ring but you never leave the house to get things started, nothing will happen.</p>
<blockquote><p>You have a shining year ahead—12 glorious months, starting now—where you will increasingly find yourself at the right place at precisely the right time.</p></blockquote>

        <p>You have a shining year ahead—12 glorious months, starting now—where you will increasingly find yourself at the right place at precisely the right time.</p>
<p>The first day to watch is one I alerted you about last month—June 2, when Jupiter and Pluto will be in perfect trine (a heavenly, divine aspect of pure harmony). Jupiter is in Gemini and Pluto is in Aquarius, two air signs that will benefit you directly, doubly so if you were a Gemini born early in May or have Gemini rising or your natal moon near 2 degrees Gemini. You will also benefit if you have another natal planet in your chart in Gemini, Libra, or Aquarius in early degrees, 0 to 4 degrees.</p>
<p>June 2 is a rare date. Jupiter and Pluto are two mega-financial planets that move very slowly, so you will feel the effects of their relationship nearly all month. Both are tied to finances, and with Pluto in your ninth house, you may find international markets to be very lucrative. Alternatively, you may make a deal in publishing or broadcasting, tapping your well-known talents in communication. See what happens on June 2.</p>
<p>Next, circle June 4 as another big day for you because your ruling planet Mercury, whose job it is to take good care of you, will conjoin Jupiter. What a great day—you can do no wrong! Mercury rules you, your personality, and your identity, vitality, and how you view yourself—you are about to see yourself and capabilities in a new light. This will give you confidence and the understanding that your innate gifts are special. You may have assumed your talents were commonplace, but the feedback you will get is that your talents (especially in communication) are outstanding. You will soon see VIPs willing to pay generously to have you in their corner.</p>
<p>During the critical first week of June, you will have a sterling new moon on June 6 in Gemini at 16 degrees. Accompanying the new moon will be her partner the Sun, Venus, your ruler Mercury, and the most breathtaking guest of honor good-fortune Jupiter. All five heavenly bodies will be in Gemini, so you will have rare control over events this month. A favorable new moon like this one can affect you for months, not for just a day. Things will tend to go your way, so by all means speak up. This is just the beginning, dear Gemini.</p>

        <p>Remarkably, Jupiter will be conjunct Mercury on June 4, and still be in significant aspect at the time of the new moon June 6. This new moon will favor you in an outstanding way. If you need to sign a contract, you could not wish for a better time to do so. Additionally, with your ruler Mercury being showered with the good fortune of Jupiter, you have the element of luck on your side.</p>
<p>There is more good news! Mercury is also the natural ruler of Gemini’s fourth house of home and family, so you likely have a lot of activity going on there. You may be moving, renovating, or staying put and simply decluttering and refreshing your décor. This month would be an ideal time to devote yourself to your home and finding ways to make it more inviting. You may see increased emphasis on your home, other property you may currently own, want to buy or sell, or will give greater attention to a family member after the new moon June 6. Looking ahead, note these days for further developments for home and family matters: September 2 and next year on March 14, 2025.</p>
<p>Two weeks after the new moon of June 6 we have a full moon on June 21 in Capricorn at 1 degree, which is considered a very active critical degree. It is also interesting to note that this full moon will be followed by a second full moon in the same sign, Capricorn, at 29 degrees, known as a degree of completion, due exactly one month after June 21 on July 21.</p>
<p>This tells me that the coming two months will strongly accent financial matters. The house that will be lit by both full moons will be your solar eighth house of other people’s money. That house does not generally rule regular weekly salary but rather one-time payments, fees or large sums from a bank loan, student loans, venture capital, research grants, taxes and tax refunds, cash gifts (or gifts of great value), mortgages and refinanced mortgages, contest winnings, insurance payouts if you filed a claim, inheritances, court settlement division of property in a divorce, and so forth. The eighth house also rules performance-based money, specifically commissions and royalties. One or two of these areas are likely to be on your mind.</p>

        <p>The full moon in June is at 1 degree Capricorn. Astrologers call this degree the “Aries Point,” which is a bit of a misnomer because it refers to ALL cardinal signs, not only to Aries, at 0 to 1 degree. The cardinal signs are Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn. The early degrees of those four signs correspond to points on the compass—north, south, east and west—hence, cardinal signs at 0 or 1 degree define direction.</p>
<p>For this reason this full moon of June 21 will be powerful and will likely bring your attention to an important financial matter. Full moons bring an ending or finish, so you might be buying or selling a house or committing to a major costly renovation, or if you own your own business, developing and investing in a new product or service to put on the market. Money will go out or come in—or both.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the aspects to this June 21 full moon at 1 degree Capricorn. The full moon will be conjunct Venus, so you will be drawn to this matter having to do with your house, and design or beauty may be one of elements you are working on in your overall plan. Saturn in Pisces will be exactly square both the full moon and Sun, suggesting you are involved in a major transaction and are mindful of the seriousness and weight of the commitment you may be undertaking.</p>
<p>It may be that you need to move, for example, but keeping up with duties at work in your high-profile job could be difficult. Saturn is currently in your tenth house of career honors, awards, and achievement and has been there since March 2023, so you are getting used to Saturn’s demands. Saturn is adding pressure, but as a versatile, adaptable Gemini, you tend to like it when you are in the midst of change, so you will figure out how to do it. The smart money is betting on you—Saturn is showing you that you have much more stamina, strength, and courage than you ever knew. Now it’s there for everyone to see. Go after that dream, dear Gemini.</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Your time has come to be rewarded, dear Gemini. You may not have been aware, but you’ve waited 12 years for Jupiter to travel through all the constellations to finally arrive in Gemini. Jupiter, the good fortune planet, already settled into Gemini last month on May 25 and is set to stay until June 9, 2025, a little over a year.</p>
<p>You have just entered your Emerald Year with a chance for international travel, stunning career growth, improved health, and opportunities for meeting your one truelove, or if attached, growing closer to your partner in your present relationship—all are in the cards. You are, quite simply, the celestial favorite of all signs.</p>
<p>To be sure you notice that things are changing strongly for the better, you have a fantastic new moon in Gemini on June 6, and it will set your new, bright year in motion. Accompanying the new moon will be her ever faithful partner the Sun, along with Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, Mercury, your ruler (whose job it is to take good care of you), and Venus, the planet that makes you popular and oh, so attractive and magnetic. New moons are powerful aspects in astrology, so watch the kind of phone calls and meetings you have in the days AFTER the new moon arrives—within 10 days of its appearance.</p>
<p>Before you get to the new moon on June 6, you will have a dazzling aspect on June 2 when mighty Pluto will send a beam—a trine—to Jupiter. This is a highly beneficial financial aspect, and because these two planets move slowly, this aspect will be in play almost all through June. This is a fantastic aspect that rarely occurs. The next time Pluto will trine Jupiter after June 2 will be September 24, 2028, four-plus years from now. This aspect only occurs on one day, so early June truly glows, and it will spread over the entire first week and with slightly less strength through June.</p>

        <p>Since all these planets are stacking up in Gemini in your first house of personality, identity, and determination, you will do best if you display to the universe your list of priorities. In fact, you may need to think about what is truly important to you and reshuffle those priorities to reflect the more modern, evolved “you.”</p>
<p>In weeks and months ahead, you will be offered an entire suite of options—consider taking the one(s) with the greatest future potential for growth. Don’t grab everything that comes your way—be choosy—because you should not spread yourself too thin so that you will be able to get the most from what is being offered.</p>
<p>At the new moon, Saturn will remind you of many responsibilities. Achieving your goals won’t be easy, but you have had Saturn in your reputation and leadership career sector (tenth house) for a little over a year, so by now, it’s likely that nothing fazes you. There’s an upside to having Saturn in a prominent position. Saturn will make sure your gains are stable and long-lasting, possibly forever. Saturn entered in your tenth house career sector last year, so that is where you may be feeling the most pressure, and will exit February 2026.</p>
<p>Sometimes planets zing their energy across the sky to the other side of the horoscope, 180 degrees away, and that would point to your home and family sector, which also may need your focused attention.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the action planet Mars is still touring your behind-the-scenes sector (twelfth house), indicating you may be in planning mode and thinking about your next action and deciding when to pounce. It would be best to wait to take a major action until after Mars enters Gemini, a privileged period that will give you a fantastic edge. Mars will be in Gemini from July 20 until September 4.</p>

        <p>There’s a problem, though. Your ruling planet Mercury will go retrograde and be in a sleepy mode between August 4 and August 28, cutting into your prime time outlined above concerning Mars’ tour of Gemini. Keep in mind Mercury’s untoward effects will be noticeable at least a week before the official retrograde period starts. This behooves you to make your most important decisions in June and July, and if possible act between July 20 and July 28—you don’t want to get too close to the start of Mercury retrograde. You are now in June, so you have plenty of time to get ready.</p>
<p>Money will be on your mind at the full moon June 21. You seem to be paying bills you owe. It is alternatively possible that you will make a large outlay of cash, and if so, will take the time to study the features of the product or service.</p>
<p>Action Mars will be supportive of the full moon of June 21 (wide degree). At the same time, good-fortune Jupiter and powerhouse Pluto will continue to be best buddies at the full moon (most of the month, even though they beamed a trine on June 2), so you may be making an investment in your own business, for a home, in stocks, bonds, or jewelry as some examples. For any investment, consult your financial advisor to get a second point of view.</p>
<p>Capricorn, the sign of the full moon, rules structure and architecture, so you may be renovating your apartment or house. Next month, you will have SECOND full moon in Capricorn, which is unusual, but it does happen occasionally. This will put a big spotlight on money management for you in the coming two months, so if you have a big dream that you want to make a reality now, your timing is absolutely perfect.</p>
