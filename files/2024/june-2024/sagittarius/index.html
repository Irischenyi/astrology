        <p>You have an urge to merge, dear Sagittarius, and the person you have chosen must be mighty special. Sagittarius is known to be slow to commit—you are very careful about forming any sort of partnership, especially marriage—but June surely seems like the perfect month for you to do so. You will have five out of 10 heavenly bodies in Gemini, your seventh house, which rules marriage and serious business collaborations and partnerships.</p>
<p>Among the planets crowded in your seventh house is the good fortune planet Jupiter, your ruler. It took Jupiter 12 years to make his journey to this area of your chart, and he is set to be here for a full year, until June 9, 2025. All throughout this time, Jupiter will bring you his blessings of happiness and growth.</p>
<p>Along with lucky Jupiter, the crowd of planets in your seventh house of marriage and partnerships are Venus (happiness), Mercury (communication and contractual agreements), the Sun (determination and will), and the June 6 new moon (opportunity) at 16 degrees, all in your opposite sign of Gemini.</p>
<p>Gemini is a breezy, light, fast-moving sign that will blend beautifully with the fire-sign element of your Sun in Sagittarius. Gemini is an air sign that will make your spirited fire-sign personality burn more brightly.</p>

        <p>Last month, and for many months, planets were crowded in earthy Taurus, a sign that does not easily blend with yours. Taurus is an earth sign, and many people use dirt—earth—to put out a fire. If you felt that the past months seemed a bit heavy, moving at a much too slow a pace for your taste, you will like the almost immediate change in environment. Think of Gemini as the wind—very fast moving.</p>
<p>You may be getting engaged or wed in the days that follow the new moon on June 6, and if so, you truly have chosen the right month and year to do so. Since you have both Venus and Mercury here along with this new moon, it cannot be overstated how fortunate your timing is for making a serious commitment. If you are not getting married this month, it may help to know that you will have Jupiter in your marriage house for a full year, until June 9, 2025.</p>
<p>Something romantic appears to be in the air for you because Mars has been circulating in Aries, your truelove sector, since April 30. As you enter June, you will still have action Mars in Aries, amplifying your love life, and he will continue to do so until June 8.</p>

        <p>Whenever you make an agreement, you need a favorable Mercury on or very near the day you sign because Mercury rules contracts. You have that at this new moon as Mercury will be conjunct Jupiter on June 4. This would be a great time to formalize any contract. A new moon is not just good for a day but will create an umbrella effect over the days and weeks to come.</p>
<p>At the time of this new moon, your ruler Jupiter will be in touch with Pluto, another absolutely remarkable aspect associated with prosperity and large financial deals. If you are signing with a new business partner, agent, publicist, accountant, lawyer, recruiter, or other professional, formalizing your agreement with this person in June would be a fantastic idea.</p>
<p>There will be one problem with the June 6 new moon in that Saturn will be in hard angle to this new moon. This suggests to me that you may have trouble finding a new house or apartment if you are getting married or simply want to try living together. Saturn won’t stop you from finding appropriate housing, but it will slow down the process, so you will have to have patience. Start looking early.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the full moon on June 21 in Capricorn, which will be the first of two full moons that will emphasize financial matters. It is unusual to see two consecutive full moons fall in the same sign—Capricorn, your second house of earned income—but that is what we have due. This month’s full moon will arrive at 1 degree Capricorn (a very energetic degree when it is in a cardinal sign, and Capricorn is a cardinal sign), and next month’s full moon will arrive again in Capricorn on July 21 at 29 degrees, a degree of completion.</p>

        <p>You seem to be polishing off a bill or making decisions about how to improve your financial picture. If you are interviewing for a job, it is likely that you and your employer will agree on your salary and other compensation for you.</p>
<p>You have both Saturn and Neptune orbiting quite close together in Pisces, the sign of the ocean, your fourth house of home. Saturn rules sturdy, heavy structures, but Neptune represents the flood that can undermine a building’s foundations. Many Sagittarians have had problems with flooding, mold, tainted water, or too little water pressure in their apartment or house when Neptune is in this sector.</p>
<p>I have been begging you for months to get a rider on your homeowner’s or renter’s insurance because most policies do not include damage from water. You do have to ask for this additional coverage. With Neptune so close to Saturn in your house of home, it’s more important that you protect yourself. If you live in an apartment building, and the maintenance people can’t seem to fix a problem, call a professional plumber—yes, you will have to pay, but in the end, it’s worth it. (This is something I had to learn the hard way.) With Neptune in hard angle to the full moon on June 21, you may have a water-related event.</p>
<p>Neptune won’t be fully out of Pisces until January 2026, and Saturn will follow suit by exiting Pisces a month later, in February 2026. Saturn teaches life lessons, and as my mother used to say, “Man learns through pain.” By that she meant we all learn quickly from painful events. Indeed we do. I am trying to help you avoid one.</p>

        <p>My insurance broker laughed out loud when I insisted on a flood rider in my homeowner insurance. He bellowed, “You live on the thirtieth floor of a New York City high-rise. You don’t need flood insurance!” That was years ago, but that day I persisted and insisted until I got it, so he sold me the extra rider to cover water damage in my apartment. I am still in the same place and have never had a problem with water over the years—not until now.</p>
<p>I am not a Sagittarius, but I was vulnerable regarding water for other reasons. As you may already know, on April 16 this year I had a massive flood in my apartment that was so big I have to move out for nine months while my contractor works to fix things. Although insurance companies are never generous, it’s better to have some payment than none.</p>
<p>With two full moons in Capricorn, you will be spending money, but cash could also be flowing in because Mars, the action planet, will be in Taurus, your work-a-day sector, so if you are part of the workforce, you will find it to be a buzzing beehive. If you are out of work, you can find a part-time or full-time job similar to what you’ve done before and on the same level. To move up in stature, you would have to wait for the new moon in Virgo on September 2 and the days that follow to find a better position with more responsibility, power, and money.</p>
<p>Plan to travel far and wide in August while Mercury retrogrades from August 4 to August 28—nothing earth shattering will happen during that time, so you won’t miss out on any opportunities.</p>
<p>Your unsinkable, bright optimism is such a big part of the luck you will experience—it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy!</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Sagittarius is known to be the “bachelor sign” because you are careful and slow to make a commitment. This is a generalization of course, but as a Sagittarius, you want to make your life as big and broad as you can dream it to be, and travel is always an important element. If your intended partner prefers to stay at home, that could be a deal-breaker. Nevertheless, could it be true that this month you are ready to promise your heart to someone you love? It very well might be, and here’s why.</p>
<p>On June 6 you will have five heavenly bodies in Gemini, your contractual marriage sector (seventh house)—the new moon (opportunity), the Sun (your determination and will), Venus (happiness), Mercury (agreements), and your ruler Jupiter (the planet of good fortune), whose job it is to take great care of you.</p>
<p>Jupiter has not been in this area of your chart for 12 years, and he just entered Gemini on May 25. Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, will remain in your marriage, partnership, and serious collaboration house for a full year, until June 9, 2025. For the first eight days of June, Mars will be in Aries, your truelove sector, and he will beam support to the love and marriage area of your chart. If you didn’t get engaged in May, you might become betrothed or wed in June, a great time to do so.</p>
<p>The idea of marriage may have sounded impossible a year or two ago, but you have been through two important eclipses (April 19, 2023, and April 8, 2024) that were both in Aries, your truelove sector, and next year you will have one more eclipse in the same sign and house (March 29, 2025). Remarkably, all three are solar eclipses—new moons on steroids—which are known to create a fresh beginning, so what may have felt so improbable to you in recent history may seem logical and doable now. You have grown in maturity, and you are ready for more—marriage may be in your picture.</p>

        <p>You may give or receive a marriage proposal this month, become engaged, or actually wed. Rarely have you ever had a better time to promise your heart to the one you love than you do now. If you are not interested in marriage, you may take on a partner, collaborator, or specialist in your business life. On June 2 your ruler Jupiter will make a brilliant, stellar aspect with Pluto, so this would be a fantastic time to decide to sign a contract, or you can wait until you reach the days that follow the new moon on June 6.</p>
<p>Once Mars moves into Taurus on June 8 (to stay until next month, July 20), you will find that your work projects will begin to multiply, and these assignments will pour in at a rapid pace. If you are self-employed, you could make solid money from the brisk business you will see.</p>
<p>Are you employed by others? Money will be the main topic on your mind at the full moon in Capricorn on June 21 and for the four days that follow. You might hear you received a raise that you had applied for earlier, or if you have interviewed for a new job, you may now find out about whether you got the position—and you can now negotiate your salary and benefits package. On another note, if your company owes you a commission or royalty, the check (or wire) could arrive during this full moon period (four to five days after June 21).</p>

        <p>Here’s another way this full moon could affect you. If you are getting married soon, you may be working on how your finances will be blended during your marriage. You might want to open a joint checking account (as a supplement to the one you have personally), or if you take your spouse’s last name in marriage, you may want to change the name on your credit card. You could be buying homeowner’s or renter’s insurance or adding your name to your mate’s health insurance. If you are not yet married but will be soon, you might be figuring out the details of a prenuptial agreement.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the June 21 full moon might bring about an unexpected expense. Neptune will be in hard angle to this full moon, so you may have some difficulty with water, such as a flood in your bathroom. If a pipe within the walls becomes worn, you might notice some leakage in your kitchen, as another example. (Neptune rules the sea and all types of water-related matters.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are formalizing an agreement near the June 21 full moon, something may be left unclear that could come back to bite you later. It would be important to check with your lawyer before signing and make any adjustments she deems necessary.</p>
