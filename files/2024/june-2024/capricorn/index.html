        <p>In this very busy month, you will need to bring your A-game. With five out of 10 heavenly bodies in your sixth house of work assignments, you will need to stay organized and alert for new clients, and customers will be beating a path to your door. This all may be surprising to you if you expected a sleepy, quiet June, but having people clamoring for your goods and services is always a good thing. It may be doubly good news if you are self-employed. Not only will clients be streaming in the door, but phones will be ringing and a motherload of emails will be pouring into your inbox.</p>
<p>What has changed, you may wonder? The biggest change is that late last month, on May 25, Jupiter, the planet of goodness, growth, good luck, and happiness moved into a new sign of Gemini and has since settled into your sixth house of work assignments. It is customary for several planets to gather together for a welcoming party, and those invited to this month’s celebration for Jupiter are Venus, Mercury, the Sun, and the new moon. All these guests will be in air-sign Gemini, so things will move fast (unlike last month, where progress was very slow). The new moon on June 6 will appear in Gemini, 16 degrees, and will set everything into motion.</p>
<p>Last month a crowd of planets gathered in Taurus and waved goodbye to wish Jupiter a safe voyage to his new placement in Gemini. Jupiter takes 12 years to rotate through all 12 constellations, spending one year in each sign. Jupiter had not been in Gemini (and your solar sixth house) for a dozen years.</p>
<p>You will not lack for projects and assignments now that Jupiter is in Gemini. In fact, you may have to hire people to help you get all the work done. Jupiter brings opportunity but also the means to take advantage of the opportunity, so you will likely get approval for hiring temporary or permanent workers. Sometimes it’s hard to find qualified people you can trust, but not this time—you will find plenty of perfect candidates who will display a solidly good work ethic and who will be enthusiastic about the job.</p>

        <p>With Jupiter in Gemini, you may be trained in A.I. to help you do your job more efficiently. New computers and software may be on the way, and your office might well be due for an upgrade—a new headquarters or a new paint job or furniture. In all, working there (even in a hybrid situation) will be more enjoyable, and these renovations will lift everyone’s morale.</p>
<p>The new moon on June 6 will be conjunct Venus, which is a wonderful coincidence because Venus is the ruler of your tenth house of fame. Do a good job on the assignments pouring in now, and you will put yourself in line for a promotion after the new moon solar eclipse on October 2.</p>
<p>The new moon in Gemini this month will also help your health and the measures you take to stay in good shape, not only on June 6 but also in the days and weeks that follow. You may want to have your annual screenings done, and this is a perfect time to do so. Pick up a new sport or get a package of training sessions. I know you will be busy at work, but that’s exactly why you need the relaxing effects of exercise to keep up with the fast-paced days ahead.</p>

        <p>You might miss Jupiter in Taurus, for Taurus is an earth sign like yours and blends beautifully with your Capricorn Sun. The pace of life is always slower while big planets are in Taurus, and you may have enjoyed the time to tend to your social life. Although you have lost good-fortune Jupiter in your fifth house of love, you still have the planet of surprise, Uranus, in Taurus, who will be there for several more years.</p>
<p>If you are single, during the time Jupiter spent in Taurus (May 2023 to May 2024) you may have discovered your one truelove or found other ways to make your emotional life richer and deeper. If you are married, you may have grown closer to your spouse. The fifth house is also associated with children, so in the past year you may have welcomed a baby into your life. Other Capricorns may have directed the Taurus energy into developing their creativity and artistic expression. You may now be delighted as you look over your output in the recent year and will feel energized to continue your work.</p>
<p>Don’t be sad to see Jupiter leave Taurus because Mars, the sexy action planet and “timekeeper” of the zodiac, will soon start to reenergize your fifth sector of true love from June 8 to July 20. Mars will enliven your social life and give you a second chance to find love and happiness in the personal side of your life.</p>
<p>I should mention that your ruler Saturn will be in hard angle to the new moon from his perch in your third house. If you are signing a contract on or just after June 6, there will be conflicting aspects, some spectacularly favorable, while others are not so good (like Saturn).</p>

        <p>Here is my advice: Sign on June 2 when Jupiter and Pluto will be in divine sync—Pluto in your second house of earned income will reach out to Jupiter in your work-a-day house. Both Jupiter and Pluto are big money planets that portend great success when they are in an outstandingly friendly aspect (like now).</p>
<p>You have another spectacular day on June 4 when Mercury—which rules contracts and all the communication arts—will conjunct good-fortune Jupiter. This is the only time these two planets will conjoin this year. This is another spectacular aspect for signing papers. In truth it is the very best you can ever wish to see. Mercury rules contracts, so you always need a favorable Mercury when you make a promise or commitment.</p>
<p>Let’s now turn to the full moon in Capricorn at 1 degree on June 21. This is a critical degree when it falls in a cardinal sign, like now (the cardinal signs are Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn). A planet at 0 or 1 degree is considered highly energetic because this degree corresponds to the points on the compass—north, south, east, or west—so when you see cardinal signs at 0 or 1 degree, this defines future direction.</p>
<p>This full moon will help you align your life in a more genuine and reflective way. It can also guide you to get in touch with your feelings and correct any part of your life that seems out of balance.</p>
<p>At the full moon you’ll have several planets in Cancer, your committed relationship and marriage sector: Venus, the Sun, and Mercury. The Sun will move in on June 20 and stay for a month, and Venus will move to Cancer a little earlier, June 17 to remain until July 11. Having Venus and the Sun in your relationship sector should improve your day-to-day interactions and help you have more fun with your sweetheart.</p>

        <p>Talkative Mercury will be on hand to improve communication as he moves into Cancer and your relationship sector on June 17 (the same day as Venus) and will stay until July 2.</p>
<p>The full moon on June 21 will be the first of two consecutive full moons that will appear in Capricorn one month apart. The first one this month will appear on June 21 at the energetic 1 degree of Capricorn. Next month, the second full moon will appear on July 21 at 29 degrees, the degree of completion.</p>
<p>During each of these full moons, something that is dearly important to you is coming to a culmination or a finish line. If your birthday falls on or within four days of December 21, you will feel this month’s full moon the most. If I asked you, “What is most important to you?” you might reply, “I don’t know—many things.” If that is how you would answer, watch what comes up at this full moon, and you will know the answer—the universe will show you.</p>
<p>If your birthday falls at the end of Capricorn, anywhere from January 15 to January 19, you will feel next month’s full moon more directly.</p>
<p>What if your birthday falls at a different time of the month, somewhere in the middle? You can do your chart on my website, AstrologyZone.com. On the home page, scroll down and select “Free Natal Birth Chart.” If you know your birth time, insert it in the fields provided and make sure “Placidus Tropical” is selected as the House System. Do this on your laptop, not your smart phone, so you can print the interpretations I wrote for you.</p>

        <p>If you don’t know your birth time, select “Whole Sign” in the House System drop-down menu. At least you will know the signs and approximate degrees of most of your planets on the day you were born. Look for planets that may be at 1 degree Capricorn, and then check to see if any are at 29 degrees Capricorn. Make a note if any are on that degree or close to it. That planet will be lit up and help you at the time of either of the Capricorn full moons. Also check for the other three cardinal signs: Aries, Cancer, and Libra. For this month’s full moon on June 21, check for those planets at 0 to 1 degree (or close to that degree), and for next month’s full moon on July 21, look for planets in the cardinal signs at 25-29 degrees.</p>
<p>You have a big month with plenty of news, and you won’t have to wait long to see it in action.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Your sixth house of work assignments, Gemini, currently holds nearly half the heavenly bodies of our solar system. The new moon will enter Gemini on June 6 and join her partner the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and good-fortune Jupiter, bringing the total of planets in Gemini to fully half of the solar system—and this will trigger news. Everyone you know may be heading to the airport, but you’ll opt to take a holiday later, possibly in September (a good time). For now, business will be brisk, and thanks to a beam between Pluto and Jupiter, you will likely feel there is plenty of money to be made.</p>
<p>If you work for others, you may get a bonus or overtime pay for your loyalty to your employers and the diligence you show with your projects. (You will have a chance for a long weekend in July and a much longer, possibly international, holiday in September.)</p>

        <p>The assignments you will do this month will be detailed and require a great deal of concentration. Saturn will challenge the new moon, so you will need to be alert and focused. Since Saturn is in your third house, the project will lean on your communication skills—writing, public speaking, editing, researching, translating, coding, fact-checking, or other related disciplines. If you work in a law office, you may be writing or checking a legal document or contract. The new moon on June 6 is in Gemini (the Twins), so you may have two major assignments or two lucrative clients to interact with this month.</p>
<p>Neptune, prone to cloud details, is traveling tightly with Saturn, so you will need to be sure that nothing is left unclear concerning this project. Meanwhile, Venus will conjoin the Sun and new moon, suggesting this assignment has the power to elevate your profile, with the possibility for a promotion. Or you could receive an offer from a competitor later this year at the new moon solar eclipse on October 2.</p>
<p>This same new moon on June 6 can help you enjoy better health. This is the perfect time to hire a trainer or start a new sport. Also, get those annual screenings and blood tests done. You seem to be concerned that your insurance won’t cover all the costs, but go anyway. One hour at the doctor can change everything and ensure that you live a longer, happier life. Pluto, the planet of regeneration, will be quite a friend to Jupiter on June 2, whose influence will continue to June 6 and the week that follows.</p>

        <p>On the Capricorn full moon on June 21, something of great importance will reach a culmination and bring closure. You might decide about how you feel about your romantic or business partner (most likely a person you have hired who signed a legal contract). It could be that you feel good—you may even get engaged or married at this time.</p>
<p>Your seventh house rules both romantic love and individuals that are important business partners, experts, or collaborators. In June, you have transiting Venus (love and good feelings) and Mercury (news, and the bubbling up of good conversation) both spending time in Cancer. Venus’ presence suggests your interaction with a spouse, steady lover, or business associate will be smooth.</p>
<p>Next month on July 21 you will have a second full moon in Capricorn, a clarifying influence. This is unusual, but it does happen occasionally. It sounds like by the end of July, you and your partners in all areas of life will be on firmer ground and on the same page, and as you move forward, that’s always good news.</p>
