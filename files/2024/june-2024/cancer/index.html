        <p>Last month on May 25, Gemini was crowned the celestial favorite because Jupiter moved into Gemini for a full year. It takes this planet of good fortune 12 years to revolve around the Sun, so as a Cancer, you are next in line to curry favor from Jupiter. You will have your turn at your Emerald Year next year from June 9, 2025, to June 30, 2026.</p>
<p>To make the most of your coming year, which will be here before you know it, you will need to get ready. A period this special only comes around every 12 years, so as an example, if you live to 96, you will only get eight of these sparkling years in a lifetime. Ancient astrologers felt it was important to prepare, so for now the biggest changes that will occur in 2024 and early 2025 will emanate within you, not from the outside in.</p>
<p>By June of next year, you will need to have all your priorities in mind and in their order of importance. The universe will bring you an array of opportunities during the intervening months, both professionally and personally. You will need to be decisive and choose the ones with the greatest long-range potential that feed and nourish your soul.</p>
<p>For now, and in the 12 months ahead (June 2024 to June 2025), you will have a more private, less public, persona. Much of your time will be spent behind the scenes building strategies for your own life. This could become an important part of your job description—deciding on the best tactics and overall strategy to put in place to grow the company (or your business) in the months and years ahead.</p>

        <p>Your best work will be done in solitude while Jupiter is in Gemini. You may be doing research or writing that requires concentration, such as fact-checking or interpreting data. You will want to screen out others’ opinions and focus on your own instincts, for those will be remarkably on target and better than any advice you receive from experts. Indeed, your intuition will be uncannily correct, and even your dreams may provide answers to a perplexing question (should you have one).</p>
<p>Another plus with Jupiter in the twelfth house is that it’s considered a highly creative placement, and you will display originality in the way you go after goals.</p>
<p>This area of your chart is also associated with physical and mental healing, so it could be an ideal time to have a medical procedure or surgery. If you feel a need to talk with a therapist, much can be accomplished in the coming year if you start after the new moon on June 6. You will want to enter your Emerald Year, starting in June 2025, in top shape, so if you have any screenings, tests, dental work, or medical work you need to attend to, do it now to clear the decks for your glorious Emerald Year, just around the corner.</p>
<blockquote><p>Friends, colleagues, clients, and even acquaintances will be impressed with your imaginative ideas, along with your superb work ethic</p></blockquote>

        <p>One of the nicest parts of Jupiter in the twelfth house is that people in authority will tend to speak of you in glowing terms behind closed doors, and they will be inclined to want to help you and see that you get chances to advance. For now, you won’t know that you have been singled out and even protected by VIPs. You will find out eventually, but not while Jupiter is in Gemini (May 25, 2024, to June 9, 2025). Still, it should be comforting for you to know you have real-life guardian angels around you to make sure you do well.</p>
<p>The new moon on June 6 will occur in this same twelfth house and activate all the topics that this area of your chart rules.</p>
<p>Saturn, the taskmaster planet, will be in hard angle to the new moon and Sun (to precise degree). You will have to work hard to see progress with projects started around this time, but hard work has never fazed you. It appears there may be talks going on in a distant city that could affect you eventually. For example, if you work for an international company whose headquarters are in a foreign city, a political situation may be developing there that spurs talks about changes that need to be made throughout the organization. No worries, though, for you seem to rise above the fray.</p>
<p>It is true that you might not agree with all the decisions being made by management behind closed doors, but Saturn is currently in a mutable (flexible) sign, Pisces, so voicing your thoughts could help turn the tide in your favor. It would be worth speaking up if you feel one of management’s decisions are wrong and could hurt the company’s sales.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, with Saturn in your ninth house, overseas travel could be difficult this month.</p>
<p>Let’s backtrack a little to June 2 when Jupiter and Pluto will make a decisive trine aspect, which is a fantastic, highly harmonious aspect associated with success and money. If you are selling something expensive on this day (or near it), such as a piece of property or a car, you are likely to get top dollar.</p>
<p>June 2 will fall on a Sunday, but you will do well on Monday, June 3, too. As a matter of fact, if you work in sales or have your own business, you will find most of the month will bring brisk business because Jupiter and Pluto move very slowly, and their orbits will be within significant mathematical range of each other during the first three weeks of June.</p>
<p>This is a five-star aspect that arrives rarely. The next time Jupiter and Pluto will make a similar aspect will be on a single day four-plus years from now in September 2028. If you are offered a salary or benefits package for a new job, you will see one of the best offers presented to you this year.</p>
<p>If you need to sign an agreement, do so during one of the finest aspects possible for this purpose, June 4, when Mercury and Jupiter will conjoin in Gemini.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at your career, which apparently has been going great. Mars will still be in Aries during the first eight days of June, making this your best time to focus on career matters and any efforts to get ahead. Mars is currently in your tenth house of prestigious professional honors, awards, and achievement, so those first eight days will be when you will find it easier than usual to see VIPs and have your idea approved and funded. If there is anyone you need to meet with, you need to make that appointment quickly.</p>

        <p>Mars first entered your important tenth house of career, which covers your contribution to the industry and the world at large, on April 30, so you’ve had this help from Mars throughout May. Now Mars is winding down, and once Mars leaves Aries on June 8, he will not be back for two years. Schedule your most important interviews, presentations, speeches, or other actions for that first week of June.</p>
<p>On June 21 at the full moon in Capricorn, 1 degree, a partnership or close relationship will be on your mind. This will be a very active full moon filled with news and announcements, for it falls on what astrologers call “The Aries Point.” This refers to any planet or lunation in a cardinal sign (Aries, Cancer, Libra, or Capricorn) from 0 to 1 degrees.</p>
<p>The Aries Point is a bit of a misnomer because it applies to all four cardinal signs, and at 0 or 1 degree, the cardinal signs correspond to the exact points of north, south, east, and west on the compass, so at 0 or 1 degree they define direction. That is why this full moon will be so energized.</p>
<p>This full moon is important for another reason. We will have a second full moon in Capricorn exactly one month from now. That means we will have two Capricorn full moons emphasizing partnerships and collaborations, the first on June 21 and the second on July 21. The second full moon will fall at 29 degrees, the degree of completion.</p>




        <h2 class="horoscope_title">Your June 2024 Horoscope for Cancer</h2>
        <! --Add the author name -->
        <span class="auther-name">by Susan Miller</span>
        <p>These full moons will put a spotlight on either a serious romantic relationship (your spouse or established, steady partner) or on a business partner or expert you hire to work with you in a confidential one-on-one way, such as an accountant, lawyer, social media director, publicist, or other specialist professional.</p>
<p>You seem to want to come to a conclusion concerning this relationship. You might make a commitment now, or the full moon may conversely bring a turning point where you decide the relationship is not for you. If you have been interviewing professionals for a business role, you may be ready to hire, or if you feel no one seems quite right, you may want to continue the process until next month’s full moon in Capricorn on July 21.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you will feel the need to make a decision about the business candidates you have already seen and interviewed so that you don’t leave anyone hanging. You will be in control, and nothing is predestined—this is simply an important point to make decisions and especially so if your birthday falls within four days of June 21.</p>
<p>There is one problem with that full moon on June 21— Neptune will be in tight, out-of-sign square to the full moon. This suggests you may need to ask more questions to fill in blank spots in your understanding of the person’s character and experience. If you are hiring a professional, reach out to their references, get a background check, and peruse their social media.</p>
<p>If you are ready to commit to marriage, make sure you have the full picture of your partner. Neptune in this position can urge you to idealize the person, but without having all the necessary facts to back up your admiration, it could be misplaced (or not). You need to find out.</p>

        <p>If you have a steady sweetheart, you may have a party to go to together on or within four days of the full moon on June 21, and you’ll enjoy it very much. In fact, you may be the one throwing the party.</p>
<p>Romantically, whether you are single and dating or already happily married or living together, this should be a good month, because Venus will move into Cancer on June 17 and stay until July 11.</p>
<p>Venus’ lover Mars will be in Taurus, also a highly compatible sign to your Cancer Sun, and Mars will stay from June 8 to July 20.</p>
<p>Both Venus and Mars will amplify your charm and magnetism. While Venus is in Cancer, you may want to refresh your appearance with one or two new wardrobe items or a new scent (you too, men). Mars in Taurus will tour your eleventh house of friendships, fun, and social activity, so you will be out and about more often than you’ve been in recent months, and you will have plenty of events to look forward to.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You have a buildup of planetary star power in the most private part of your chart, the twelfth house, so you may be scheduling confidential talks after the new moon in Gemini on June 6. Mercury will conjoin Jupiter earlier, on June 4, and will still be close enough to provide shimmering rays to this new moon in Gemini. Talks will be highly productive in the first week of June with a lot of flexibility among the participants.</p>

        <p>Saturn will be in hard angle to the Sun and new moon, as well as Venus, so it appears you will need to burn the midnight oil in coming weeks to get your plan launched. While the process won’t be easy, the payoff appears to be considerable and worth all the effort you will put into it. Travel may be hard to do this month, especially if going to a foreign country. Alternatively, a political situation may be bubbling up (unbeknownst to you) with changes being made by management that you may not agree with. If you don’t—speak up.</p>
<p>June 4 would be an ideal time to sign any kind of contract or to make an indelible promise to someone you care about.</p>
<p>The twelfth house, where all the action will be for you this month, and in many ways for the next 12 months, is also a place of healing. If you have thought about seeing a therapist regarding a particular problem that has been tugging at your heart, this would be a good time to start seeing someone.</p>
<p>At the same time, your intuition will be very sharp. Pay attention to your hunches, and also to any vivid dreams that you may have, in the first three weeks of June as you may get an additional clue to unlocking a problem.</p>
<p>On another note, your career is likely to have made impressive progress in April and May, and the momentum you built up will carry you forward for many weeks. As the month starts out, Mars is still lighting up your tenth house of prestigious leadership, honors, and awards through June 8, so make it a point during that first week to get your foot in the door with anyone you need to see to advance your career. You will have the favor of Mars to help you.</p>

        <p>After that, while Mars tours Taurus from June 8 to July 20, you won’t have to work quite so hard for a while, and you will start to see a harvest from your previous labors. Friends, colleagues, clients, and even acquaintances will be impressed with your imaginative ideas, along with your superb work ethic, and your kind leadership style means others will be eager to work with you.</p>
<p>You will have time for your partner at the full moon on June 21 when you may have an event to attend together—or you may throw a party yourselves and invite many friends. Alternatively, being in a reflective planning mood, you may choose a new goal to work on as a couple. You will be mixing and mingling socially more often than usual this month, so plan to go to a dress-up affair on Saturday June 21 (or over the ensuing weekend). Invite friends along, including your sweetheart if you have one.</p>
<p>If you are single, you will be magically magnetic on June 28 when Venus in Cancer contacts Mars in Taurus. Who could possibly resist you?</p>
<p>In fact, try to circulate more during the period when Venus will be in Cancer (a once-a-year event), extending from June 17 to July 11. Pick out new clothes, and see to your appearance—it’s time to have fun giving yourself a refresh—then step out.</p>
