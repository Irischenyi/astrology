        <p>As June opens, your ruling planet Mars will still be in Aries until June 8, leaving early in the morning the next day. While you still are being given a substantial advantage in talks or negotiation, use these first eight days of June to press forward in matters that are dearest to your heart. Mars will give you a certain “presence” and magnetism and will make you more courageous, persuasive, and attractive. It is quite a lovely aspect, and you will notice that people will be inclined to help you and to approve your ideas. You won’t have Mars in Aries again until April 2026, so use the time you have now to your advantage.</p>
<p>If your birthday falls at the end of your sign, from April 16 to April 19, Mars will be hovering overhead (moving through the last degrees of Aries) and will give you a double dip of favor by having the direct rays of Mars contacting your Sun.</p>
<p>During this special first week, Jupiter will receive a brilliant beam from powerful Pluto on June 2. This suggests financial news will be very strong as June opens. A friend may speak up for you and help you bring in a well-paying job or client. It’s alternatively possible that a club you belong to will be helpful. If you are taking on a new job, this is the day to negotiate your new salary. June 2 is a Sunday, so if you don’t work on weekends, jump on things on Monday, June 3, or Tuesday, June 4.</p>
<p>Also, the first week of June will bring the new moon, which will be in the highly compatible sign of Gemini, an air sign that beautifully aligns with your fire-sign Aries Sun. The new moon will light your third house of travel, learning, communication, and contractual agreements. This new moon will be “filled with sunshine.” You have five heavenly bodies all grouped together in the inquisitive, curious, and mentally sharp sign of Gemini, so there’s a strong chance you will want to travel a short distance within days after the new moon arrives.</p>

        <p>This is basically a contractual area of the chart , so you may be presented with papers to sign, and with Mercury so close to Jupiter, this would be a great time to sign papers. (Jupiter will conjoin Mercury exactly on June 4, so you may see a development then—a wonderful one!) Keep your cell phone and computer powered up.</p>
<p>This new moon on June 6 will help you shine on interviews or if you are asked to give a speech or presentation. Make a list of all the points you will want to convey when you meet, and if you memorize them (or have them on file cards), you will be unstoppable. A new moon marks the start of something new, so this all sounds quite exiting.</p>
<p>Venus will be conjunct this new moon, and Neptune will be perfectly in sync with Pluto, so if you are making design choices, the force will be with you on that new moon June 6.</p>
<blockquote><p>The June 21 full moon could bring a landmark moment in your career. You are about to have praise and opportunity heaped on you.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Saturn in Pisces will be in a difficult square to the new moon in Gemini, so you might have tasks that need to be attended to first, which could somewhat limit the range of your participation. If you are committing to spending a large sum of money on a big project, Saturn in this position will create perimeters, so you will likely to be forced to remain within budget limits. Alternatively, this aspect of Saturn might simply make you cognizant of weightiness of the commitment you are making. This is a solidly sweet new moon, so proceed with optimism.</p>
<p>Aries with birthdays that fall on April 5 (plus or minus four days) will feel the benefits of this new moon the most. The same is true if you have your natal moon in Aries or Aries rising within five degrees of 16 degrees. Look at your chart. You can do your chart for free on my website. Go to the home page of Astrology Zone, and find where it says “Free Natal Birth Chart” in the middle of the page. (You can only create your chart on my site, not my app.) Once you have your chart, see if you have any planets at 16 degrees (plus or minus four degrees) in Aries, Leo, Sagittarius, Gemini, Libra, or Aquarius—if you do, you ,too, will feel the energy of that new moon in a positive way.</p>
<p>Until now, astrologically, a large group of transiting planets have been strongly in earth sign Taurus, which does not mix well with your fire-sign Aries. Think about it like this: Imagine that you need to put out a fire—what do you do? You might throw handfuls of dirt on it.</p>
<p>With planets migrating into breezy, fast-moving air-sign Gemini, your plans will now begin to move forward quickly. June and July will bring you the ideal environment for progress. By August, Mercury will retrograde again, from August 4 to August 28, signaling a time to rest. As you see, you’ll need to be decisive in June and July while you can make tracks through the woods (so to speak).</p>

        <p>Your mind will be hungry for stimulation in early June, so if you feel it is impossible for you to travel even a short distance for any reason, you might instead opt to sign up for a class to brush up on developments in your profession. Alternatively, you may be motivated to go to a book signing of one of your favorite authors or of an author you saw recently interviewed on TV about his or her new book. If you go, you’ll be glad you made the effort to attend.</p>
<p>It is also very possible that you will be involved with a writing, editing, or producing project, as Gemini is strongly associated with communication. You may be redesigning a website, developing a digital game, working on an advertising or social media campaign, starting to write a book or an e-book, or working with a team to create a new app. If so, begin on or just after the new moon appears June 6, for if you do, you’ll have cosmic energy to help you do well. These are examples to illustrate the type of subjects that may come up, and you can think of others that fit the category.</p>
<p>This new moon of June 6 deserves a gold star because Jupiter, newly minted in Gemini (as of last month, May 25) will now be traveling very close to Gemini’s ruler Mercury. That makes this new moon a sparkling stand out. Also, Pluto in your friendship sector (in Aquarius) will be beaming Jupiter and Mercury, both in early degrees of Gemini, with radiant rays, which is another amazingly fortunate aspect. These planets add to the likelihood that the new moon will offer you good fortune and opportunity. If you’re interviewing for a new job, you may hit on one that pays you exceedingly well.</p>
<p>Once Mars enters Taurus and your second house of earned income and savings on June 8, you will begin to spend more than usual. It may be that you’ve been saving up for an expensive item, such as a car or computer. Alternatively, you may be going through a lifestyle change, and those periods always seem to require a lot of check writing. It looks as though your main spending will be directed toward your home, perhaps for a rental of a summer cottage, or to buy a handsome piece of furniture that will make your place to look “just so.” In a different scenario, you may be giving money to a family member who needs financial assistance.</p>

        <p>Later in the month will be the full moon of June 21 in Capricorn at 1 degree that will culminate an important career matter. This full moon is an interesting one because it will be the first of two full moons that will be in Capricorn. Next month on July 21 you will have ANOTHER full moon in Capricorn—an unusual happenstance that occurs occasionally—this time at 29 degrees that will again brilliantly light your tenth house of honors, awards and achievement. Apparently the coming weeks will put a big emphasis on your career progress.</p>
<p>Let’s concentrate on this month’s full moon, June 21, when the full moon will be at the tip-top of your chart. If you have been interviewing for a job, the answer will come through within four days of June 21. Any job you are interviewing for would be an exceptional position—a step up—with influence and power.</p>
<p>Neptune will be in hard angle to the full moon June 21, so if you are interested in the position, make absolutely sure you understand the range of duties that would be expected of you. Neptune can bring on wishful thinking—you may hear what you want to hear, not what is being told to you—so double-check your view of the job. On the other hand, Mars, your ruler, will be in wide (but significant) heavenly trine to the full moon in your prestigious career house from your financial second house of earned income. This tells me you would be paid well.</p>
<p>The Sun, Venus, and Mercury, all in Cancer, will partner with this full moon, suggesting you will need to consider how you can be available to family while you ease into your new job. This position might need you to juggle home and career, not so easy to do initially, but you can handle your new schedule by applying experience, skill, and care. Next month, on July 21, the second of the two full moons in Capricorn will occur, and it is possible that a portion of Aries readers will hear their final offer or answer then instead—next month. This is especially true if you were born late in the sign, from April 16 to April 19.</p>
<p>This is not a month that heavily emphasizes romance, but nevertheless, you will find the period until June 17 when Venus tours Gemini to be the very best time for you to enjoy love (Venus first entered Gemini last month on May 23). Love may come on a short trip or simply by doing errands around the neighborhood. If you are single, you might meet someone new who is quite intriguing, so always look your best whenever you leave the house.</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Mars will be in his last days of Aries, a once-in-two-year privilege, putting you in the center of all that is happening. Mars first entered Aries on April 30, and you still have just over one more week, from June 1 to 8, to use Mars to make an important initiation. Mars will help you succeed.</p>
<p>June 2 is a stand-out day when Jupiter will trine Pluto, a very rare event that fosters beneficial financial news for investing (not gambling). I am not a financial astrologer, so be sure to work with one or more of your financial advisors to get their opinion.</p>
<p>Also, in this critical first week of June, the new moon on June 6 will arrive in your third house of communication and contractual agreements. You may start to be involved in a project involving major writing, editing, public speaking, translating, research, public relations, social media, advertising, coding, negotiating, or other related disciplines. You may get an exciting assignment, for Jupiter just entered this area of your chart on May 25, and you have a glorious year ahead to see your mastery over communication grow.</p>
<p>The lovely new moon of June 6 arrives with her entourage—the Sun, Mercury, Venus, and Jupiter—so including the new moon, there will be five heavenly bodies in your communication sector—talkative, curious Gemini. This will make June a fast-moving month, with many meetings and the need for you to make quick decisions on the fly. Planets in the third house also suggest that you might decide to take a trip this month—you will be ready for pampering. In fact, if you go, you may visit two neighboring cities. You will like this influence for Gemini is an air sign, and you are a fire sign—Gemini’s air will make your fire burn more brightly.</p>

        <p>Saturn will press hard on the new moon and Sun, so you will work hard. Neptune is close to Saturn, so you may be at a loss to find out exactly what your company or client expects you to do. Ask for a job description in writing. Luckily, planets in Gemini will allow for a lot of conversation. Gemini is also a mutable sign, which means things are flexible, with little or nothing etched in stone yet. This is helpful to know if you are signing a contract this month, which is very likely. (The third house, so lit up, is also the contractual house.) If you are unhappy with any of the terms or clauses, have your lawyer suggest adjustments, and don’t be shy about speaking up.</p>
<p>Mars is about to enter your second house of earned income on June 8 to stay until July 20, suggesting you will spend more money than usual over the course of the coming weeks. It’s possible you’ve been saving to buy a car or a computer, or have been spending on a renovation or to refurbish your apartment, or you may be planning to lease or buy a new piece of property.</p>
<p>If you have not purchased any new clothes lately, you may need to refresh your wardrobe with a striking new outfit. If you are in the process of a lifestyle change, that, too, would explain why you are seeing a drain on your bank account. You had an opportunity at last month’s new moon May 7 to increase your income, so perhaps you managed to get a raise or new well-paying job in the days that followed that new moon. You may be feeling flush and in the chips.</p>
<p>The June 21 full moon could bring a landmark moment in your career. You are about to have praise and opportunity heaped on you. Mars will be in the ideal position to support that full moon from your financial house, so the job you may be interviewing for now would pay you generously. This full moon may mark a promotion or new job or, if you are self-employed, the arrival of a prestigious client. You will have a second chance to elevate your career next month on the July 21 full moon, so see how things go.</p>

        <p>Neptune is currently within inches of being in Aries for the first time since 1861 to 1875. Neptune will officially enter Aries next year on March 30, 2025, for several months before dipping back into Pisces, but this month Neptune will be remarkably close to your sign, it’s less than a half-degree away from Aries.</p>
<p>Neptune in Aries will be a new influence for you, and it will first affect those born March 21-23. If your birthday is named, you will need to be sure to ask many questions and continue to strive to be as realistic and clear-eyed as possible when entering new ventures. Neptune can make you imaginative and creative, able to think outside the box, but as a master of illusion, Neptune can also make you fall victim to wishful thinking. Do your due diligence, and you will fare well during the coming 14 years of Neptune in Aries, all the way until March 2039.</p>
<p>Romance will be best in the first half of the month, doubly so if you take a short little trip to a nearby town.</p>
