        <p>Life is about to become brighter and more beautiful each day, dear Libra. Jupiter, the planet of good fortune and happiness, just moved into Gemini last month (May 25) for the first time in a dozen years. Jupiter is now in an air sign like yours, which is significant because in his new breezy, light placement, you can more easily access Jupiter’s full range of benefits.</p>
<p>While Jupiter was in his previous sign, Taurus, he likely improved your financial picture, but life was not too exciting because your air sign may have felt, at times, smothered by the weight of earthy Taurus. If certain days seemed heavy and life felt laborious, you now know why. This month you will see the difference because not only is Jupiter in Gemini but so is the Sun, Mercury, Venus, and the June 6 new moon. This new moon will be in Gemini, 16 degrees, and it will be as sweet as sugar.</p>
<p>Since there is a crowd of heavenly bodies—five in all, thereby half the solar system—all “trine” to your natal Sun or ascendant (an aspect of great harmony), you have a superb outlook. You are not used to seeing this level of support. Your optimism and your health should immediately benefit. Stretch your arms over your head as you shout “Hallelujah!”</p>
<p>All of these planets, plus the Sun and new moon in Gemini, 16 degrees, have migrated into your ninth house, which rules, among other things, distant travel, so pull out your suitcase from under the bed, and start packing. It looks like you will be heading out by air or car (or both) in June.</p>

        <p>This won’t be your last trip of the year either. Jupiter, whose intention is to broaden your view of life, will be on a mission to see you travel to distant cities more times in the months to come. Jupiter will remain in Gemini, your sweet spot, until June 9, 2025.</p>
<p>The fact that this new moon in Gemini has your ruler Venus in Gemini as part of her entourage tells me that you will enjoy your travels, including the trips you take in June and the ones you will go on over the coming 12 months. In June your ruler is in the perfect place to alight your magic carpet to points unknown—you are “all in” and eager to go.</p>
<p>Also, Mercury will be conjunct Jupiter on June 4, which is a marvelous sign for success in travel or for any project that involves communication (writing, editing, public speaking, publicity, advertising, social media, research, or translation) as well as any work you might do in the digital world, such as with e-books or audio books, A.I., or in developing a smart phone app or video game, as some examples.</p>

        <p>Additionally, Mercury will be contacted in a very friendly way by Pluto in Aquarius, your fifth house of love, romance, children and creativity, two days before the June 6 new moon. Wow, you really have a great chart. You might plan a family vacation that weaves a memory that you’ll all cherish forever.</p>
<p>The new moon on June 6 will also help you to earn a degree as a graduate or undergraduate student because Jupiter will assist you to broaden your understanding of the world around you. If you are involved in a legal case, you will be favored in June in an outstanding way due to this new moon, but also through the coming months thanks to Jupiter in Gemini. If you work in either publishing or broadcasting, you will be in demand and very busy.</p>
<p>The only difficult planet in this otherwise perfect picture at the new moon on June 6 is transiting Saturn, which is currently in Pisces, your work-a-day sector (sixth house). It seems that pressing professional assignments or the needs of a family member may interfere with your ability to travel (unless, of course, you go for business). If you are organized, you can take care of everything and still have your cake and eat it too—you can go.</p>
<p>Libras who have a birthday that falls on October 8, plus or minus five days, will benefit the most from this glorious new moon. The same is true if you have Libra rising or your natal moon is in Libra within 5 degrees of 16 degrees. Check to see if you have any planets in your natal chart in Gemini, Libra, Aquarius, Aries, Leo, or Sagittarius at 16 degrees, plus or minus 5 degrees. If you do, the planets will light up and help you.</p>

        <p>Now let’s turn to the June 21 full moon in Capricorn, 1 degree, that will be the first of two full moons in a row (one month apart) in Capricorn. Next month’s full moon on July 21 will fall in Capricorn at 29 degrees, a degree of completion. As you see, you will have a lot of attention on your home and family.</p>
<p>This month’s full moon on June 21 is highly active because it falls at 1 degree of a cardinal sign. (The cardinal signs are Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn.) Something is nearing completion—it could be a decision or project. You need to be clear about the facts that are coming toward you—Neptune will create a fog, and you will want to make sure you understand all the facets of a situation. Ask many questions. Neptune also rules water, so guard against any water damage in your home or other property you might own.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at your career. You will see a cheerful uptick in this area of your life when the Sun moves into Cancer, your professional tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement, on June 20, to stay for one month. The Sun will join his friends Mercury and your ruler Venus who will both already be there. Venus enters Cancer on June 17, to stay until July 11. Venus’ move into Cancer will help your prospects for bringing in new clients or making other kinds of progress on the job. Mercury also enters Cancer on June 17 and is due to remain there until July 2.</p>
<p>You will be spending more money than usual while Mars tours Taurus from June 8 until July 20. Your house of other people’s money will be activated by Mars, so you may be seeking a loan or mortgage for a major project.</p>

        <p>The most interesting aspect for you to settle a deal or make money by bringing in a client (you can add other sources) will be when Venus and Mars are sextile on June 28 (a friendly aspect that encourages opportunity) because they will set up a sturdy link between your house of money and your career sector. See how it goes—the transiting moon will be in entrepreneurial Aries, a wonderful sign for you.</p>
<p>Romantically, your very best time occurs while your ruler Venus (the planet of love) tours air-sign Gemini, which started last month on May 23, and will extend to June 17. Mars, the planet that is Venus’ lover, will be in Aries in early June before he leaves for Taurus on June 8. You will find these first nine days of June to be a special time for love.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Are you leaving town, dear Libra? With five heavenly bodies filling Gemini, your ninth house of distant trips, it would be hard to stay home. You may be traveling as part of your job, for pleasure, to do research, or to take classes toward a degree at an institution of higher learning. Alternatively, you might travel to take a seminar or attend a convention to catch up on emerging developments in your industry. No matter what the reason is for your trip, you will thoroughly enjoy it this month. Good-fortune Jupiter moved into Gemini last month on May 25 for the first time in 12 years.</p>
<p>This will be a long, fascinating, and enjoyable trend. Jupiter will remain in Gemini for a little over a year, so this trip or learning experience will only whet your appetite for more. You won’t be going to a secluded place either—you are more likely to head to a city where there will be many people and plenty of conversations. This month you will also need to field a plethora of phone calls and emails as these will pour in at a rapid rate. Saturn will be in hard angle to the new moon on June 6, so you may initially feel a little overwhelmed, but if you simply break down your tasks into small bites, you will master it all.</p>

        <p>If you cannot travel, you may be working with people from other nations within your own country—in person or on the phone—but the influence of other cultures will be noticeable.</p>
<p>If you are involved in a legal proceeding, you may be surprised to notice that the case is starting to turn in your favor. If appropriate, you might want to see if you can negotiate a settlement without going through with the court case. You will have a full year of help from Jupiter, so if you have to move forward in court, by all means, do it.</p>
<p>Pluto in Aquarius, your fifth house of creativity, will help you in magical ways to come up with fresh ideas from deep within you. Projects involving broadcasting or publishing will start to shine for you.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to overstate the importance of having lucky Jupiter in a fellow air sign (Gemini). This is the first time in four years that you can count on such strong support from good-fortune Jupiter. You will enjoy improved health, and you will begin to attract influential, successful people who will want to help you reach your goals.</p>

        <p>You will have a chance to travel more often, not only now, but throughout the coming 12 months, including to far-flung places that you never thought you’d ever visit. Career opportunities will pop up in July. Perhaps most exciting, if you are single, you have a great chance of finding your one truelove, and if you are attached, spend more time together, and enjoy the warmth of your closeness. You will soon find that having Jupiter’s rare help is an amazingly happy development.</p>
<p>Since April, your partner, spouse, or live-in steady sweetheart seems to have been making news in your life.Your focus has been on these incoming updates, for in many ways, you knew that all that was happening to your partner would directly affect you, too. This concentration on your significant other will wind down once Mars leaves Aries on June 8.</p>
<p>While Mars is in Taurus from June 8 to July 20, you will see your spending increase. You might be taking an expensive vacation, paying taxes, sending a deposit for your child’s camp, or paying tuition for the upcoming semester. Your expenses may rise because you need to make an large purchase, such as a new car, kitchen appliance, computer, or new clothes for the upcoming season.</p>
<p>Mercury is not retrograde (that won’t happen until August 4 to August 28), but you will feel the slowdown and haywire effect of this planet as soon as the end of July. It is never wise to buy anything that’s expensive or contains electronic chips during Mercury retrograde. Still, this is June, so you have plenty of time to manage your purchases. June will be a fantastic time to shop.</p>

        <p>By the full moon on June 21 in Capricorn, your attention will turn to your home life, and at the same time, something will be cresting in your career. This month, changes at home will take precedence, so if you have to move, make repairs, hire a contractor, acquire a new piece of furniture, paint a room, or completely redecorate, you may be making a final decision now or seeing a project finish. If your house is fine as it is, then you might instead be focused on something that’s going on in your family, most likely your mother.</p>
<p>At the very same time, things will be going well in your career. Pluto will be in league with Jupiter most of the month, suggesting you will be nicely paid for the work you are involved in now. Your current project seems to rely on your creative talents, and you appear to be firing on all cylinders these days. There is no project too big for you to tackle or for you to suggest a completely original approach.</p>
<p>Mars will send a friendly beam directly to your ruler Venus and also to Mercury, who will both be in Cancer, your prestigious tenth house of career advancement and leadership. This is a good omen that VIPs will applaud you and praise the work you are doing.</p>
<p>Saturn will be in hard attitude to the Sun and this full moon, so it will be a busy time with too much to do and too little time to get it all done. This is nothing new for you—you are used to this and probably have developed a good method to handle it.</p>
<p>Your best time for fun and romance will be while Venus tours fellow air-sign Gemini, which began on May 23, and will continue until June 17. As you see, Venus will be moving especially swiftly. While your window for fun and love will be narrow in June (only two weeks or so), Venus will compensate by being stronger than usual.</p>

        <p>This period of Venus in Gemini (May 23 until June 17) is an excellent time to mingle and meet a new love interest. Attached couples will feel closer now, too. During this same period, ask your stylist to recommend a fresh hairstyle. Both women and men readers may want to consider finding a new light perfume or cologne to wear. You might also like to add one new item or outfit to your wardrobe during this short but bright period. Venus, your ruler, will be working hard to see that you receive a flurry of compliments.</p>
<p>The June 21 full moon in Capricorn will light your fourth house of home and family. Even if you didn’t think you would be planning a move, with a strong spotlight on this area of your life, you could accidentally come across the ideal apartment or house, and suddenly, you might want to take it. Alternatively, an outside event may cause you to need to renovate, and since it’s necessary, you might do a full-scale refresh and modernization of your present home.</p>
<p>On a smaller scale, you might call in the painters, buy a new piece of furniture, have your rugs steamed, or ask your landscape designer to give your property a beautiful new look with flowers, shrubs, and trees. Full moons bring a final decision, or they wrap up an effort, so you may see the end of a home-related project.</p>
<p>If nothing much is happening at your home, your parents might have news, and they may even want a little help from you this month or in July (as we will have another full moon in Capricorn in July).</p>
