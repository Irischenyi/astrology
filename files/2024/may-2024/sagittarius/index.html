        <p>Friends are telling you about their exciting upcoming trips, but you can’t help feeling a little twinge of jealousy. Business is brisk, and there is no way you can leave town now, for your clients and team need you. Besides, if you do leave, details are likely to fall between the cracks and only create more work for when you return.</p>
<p>Set your sights on planning to go on vacation on or after August 4, the new moon in your distant travel sector. Even though Mercury will be retrograde throughout August, it will be fine to travel. You’ll be happily swimming in turquoise waters or hiking in the thickly verdant woods, while back at the office, nothing earth-shattering will be happening. It will be a good time to kick back and relax.</p>
<p>After spending a year in your work-a-day assignment (sixth) house, Jupiter is getting ready to leave Taurus this month and head to another sign, and the little planets decided to give Jupiter a festive send off. The party kicks off when the gracious new moon arrives on May 7 with her partner the Sun, both in Taurus at 18 degrees. In the new moon’s entourage will be Venus, who is mistress of ceremonies, for she organized the party and is in charge. She invited Uranus, the planet that brings surprises, and the guest of honor, Jupiter, the planet of good fortune. It is one of the sweetest, happiest new moons of the year.</p>
<p>Jupiter likely brought you plenty of business over the past 12 months, and if you had to hire help to complete all the orders, Jupiter also helped you find qualified workers. You may have had a new or upgraded workplace, possibly with new equipment (like new computers, software, or other tools) so that you could get your work done with ease.</p>

        <p>This same sixth house rules your health—not your vitality and strength (that is covered by your first house) but the preventative steps you take to stay healthy though screenings, procedures, and regular doctor and dentist visits, along with taking your medicine regularly and so forth (sixth house). Jupiter is currently based here and is not only the planet of luck but also of miracles, so this month is still an excellent time to attend to health matters, ideally before Jupiter is due to leave on May 25.</p>
<p>You have a very busy sixth house with half the solar system residing here in May. Once Jupiter leaves Taurus he will not be back to this sign and house until April 2035. Uranus, traveling shoulder-to-shoulder with Jupiter, will bring upbeat, happy surprises, whether work or health related.</p>
<p>The fact that Venus is in fine, supportive communication with the new moon and Sun brings me to a third reason I feel all news will be good news. Venus rules this new moon and suggests its final outcome—she is so compatible to the new moon that you should remain optimistic.</p>
<blockquote><p>While everyone will love the Luckiest Day of the Year, you will love it more because Jupiter is your guardian planet.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Saturn, currently in Pisces, will also send the Sun and new moon his greetings at party time. He is too far away in deep space to attend, but even so, Saturn will be sextile the new moon (an opportunity aspect), so Saturn will be able to add to your feelings of confidence and security. Decisions you make now will likely have a comforting long-range effect. This is one of the best new moons I have seen in a long time. I cannot see everything in your unique natal chart from where I sit, but judging from what I can see, all systems are go, with blue skies ahead.</p>
<p>The Luckiest Day of the Year will arrive mid-month on May 18, with a plus or minus two days of influence. This day brings the Sun in perfect alignment with Jupiter, and all the areas I covered above—proactive health measures and work-related assignments—should go exceptionally well. Use this day, or the two days before or after, to pitch your boss to let you work on a plum project. Or you can make a presentation or a speech, sign a contact, or have a procedure that you are a little nervous about, like a root canal—it will likely go smoothly, like cutting through soft butter.</p>
<p>Jupiter is the planet of healing and is also associated with financial gain. Most importantly, Jupiter is your ruling planet, whose job is to take good care of you. While everyone will love this Luckiest Day of the Year, you will love it more because Jupiter is your guardian planet.</p>
<p>The full moon this month will fall on May 23 in Sagittarius, 3 degrees. Something of enormous personal importance to you will be reaching culmination. This full moon will be in beautiful orientation to Neptune, the planet ruling the arts and based in your home sector. This suggests if you are working on giving your home a refresh, your choices of furniture, art, paint colors, fabrics, and so forth should be quite beautiful.</p>

        <p>Neptune rules unconditional love and compassion too, so if you find that you are helping a parent or other family member that needs you, you will know that this is something you need to do and will feel relieved that you were in a position able to help your beloved relative at the critical moment.</p>
<p>Pluto will also be perfectly aligned to both the full moon and Sun, helping you from your contractual house—in that regard, a contract seems to work to your advantage. It is always wise to show your lawyer your contract before signing, but I feel changes would be minor and in your favor.</p>
<p>This same solar third house where Pluto resides these days rules short-distance travel, so this day and the accompanying weekend would be lovely for a romantic trip for two. If you can take a few vacation days, ask your mother or sister if she will help take care of your children (if you have wee ones) for this would be a dazzling time for romantic, quality time with the one you love.</p>
<p>On May 25, Jupiter, your ruler, will move to Gemini and brighten your house of committed relationships. Jupiter will remain there for 12 months, until June 9, 2025. Sagittarius is known to be slow to commit to marriage, but if you have found your one truelove, and you are ready, you may get engaged or wed soon, possibly next month.</p>

        <p>I say June because June will bring a cosmic party in your opposite sign of Gemini (ruling your partner) with many planets gathering to welcome Jupiter in your house of marriage and commitment. The new moon June 6 and the days that follow will begin the festivities and shine for you to make promises in love.</p>
<p>If you are not ready to wed but dating seriously, you might promise to be exclusive to each other or plan to move in together.</p>
<p>Jupiter can also help you in business relationships, to form associations that can be mutually beneficial. You might hire an expert to help you work more efficiently, and that person might be, for example, a bookkeeper, accountant, social media or advertising director, publicist, or agent—you get the idea—in other words, an expert you choose in the coming months who would work sublimely well with you in a confidential one-to-one way. Even someone in your personal life, like a wedding planner or nanny, would turn out to be a gem.</p>
<p>If you have your own company, you may do a cross promotion with another company that would be highly successful for both of you. In the coming 12 months, working in tandem with another person, whether in love or in business, is where your golden nuggets will lie.</p>

        <p>If you work for others and are in sales, you can form close, highly successful programs with your clients, engendering their greater loyalty to you.</p>
<p>Something else will occur on May 23, separate from the full moon (but on the same day), involving an exact conjunction of your ruler Jupiter to graceful Venus in Taurus, 29 degrees. Venus is the natural ruler of your solar eleventh house of social activity. This same house also rules your dearest hopes and wishes. You are likely to get good news on or very close to May 23, perhaps allowing you to come close to (or actually capture) a long-held dream</p>
<p>Additionally, you may be invited to an enchanting party near May 23, and it will be an event where the host will make sure you feel pampered the entire time. Be sure to accept that invitation! If YOU are the one giving a party at that time, it is sure to be a hit with everyone who attends. You will make the atmosphere quite heavenly. Jupiter only meets with Venus once a year, and it is happening this month. (Just like Jupiter conjunct the Sun on the Luckiest Day, Jupiter meets each year with Venus on only one day, always in a different part of the chart and always in a different sign.)</p>
<p>If you are already married, your partner will do exceptionally well (most likely financially) in the 12 months to come, from May 25, 2024, to June 9, 2025, and this, of course, will benefit you, too. Your spouse will be more attentive to you and be consistently more optimistic than he or she has been about the future. Your mate will also likely become more interested in traveling with you to adventurous, exciting locations that neither of you have ever seen.</p>
<p>You have so much to look forward to now.</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>A project—personal or professional—will completely capture your passionate attention, and the assignment or endeavor will show up in the days that follow the new moon in Taurus on May 7. This project seems to mean a lot to you, for you will be concentrating quite a bit on it, almost to the exclusion of everything else. Your ruler Jupiter, giver of gifts and luck, will be in the same work sector (sixth house) as the new moon, a signal that the assignment you are given would have wide scope, and there’s a likelihood that you would be paid generously, too.</p>
<p>At this new moon on May 7, Jupiter will be orbiting very close to Uranus, the planet of surprise. It looks like Uranus will bring up news about this project unexpectedly in a weird or possibly haphazard way. Uranus’ presence also suggests that you can come up with a plethora of creative ideas to add to it. In astrology Uranus is called the higher octave of Mercury, taking the lightning quick intellect and communication ability of Mercury and resynthesizes the gifts of Mercury into a realm so new and original it’s called genius.</p>
<p>Having said that, planets in earthly Taurus suggest that you will need to add a touch of practicality and realism and be mindful of budgets. Your ideas will be sensational, but keep them within the real world to make sure they are doable financially and can be approved and materialized for all the world to see. This is a tricky balance, but you can do it—everyone is counting on you.</p>
<p>The May 7 new moon is one of the sweetest new moons of the year. Give everything you’ve got to this project. This endeavor seems to have powerful implications for your career, allowing you to elevate your name professionally to a new, higher place in your industry, and you may see advancement possibly as soon as September.</p>

        <p>If you need to pitch a client or show a preview of work done so far, do it on May 18, the Luckiest Day of the Year (influential for plus or minus two days) when your ruler Jupiter will align with the mighty Sun. This aspect only happens once a year, always in a different place in your chart and in a different sign.</p>
<p>If you have had any health concerns, this glorious month will also be the ideal time to have tests and screenings or to go to a new specialist for a consultation. Your guardian planet Jupiter, so strong this month, is the planet of generosity and expansion, but also of healing and, occasionally, even brings miracles. Go for help.</p>
<p>The full moon in Sagittarius of May 23 will be a major moment of you, doubly so if you were born within five days of November 24. A matter of great personal importance to you will be coming to fruition or conclusion. It may require a short trip to see a person dear to you in a close relationship. If you need to drive over the days of full moon, make sure your car is in good working order before you head out, and that includes the computer software in your car. You certainly don’t need to be stuck on the side of the road with a mechanical or software malfunction.</p>

        <p>Also, this full moon (influential for four days after May 23) will find Mars in Aries in your sector of true love close to the same degree as the recent total eclipse on April 8. If not much came up last month in the days that followed April 8 in matters of the heart, you may see a development at this full moon, May 23.</p>
<p>If single you could meet someone who could quietly change your life when you both decide you want to know each other better. If you are attached, Mars will bring more fun to your life—expect to get more loving attention, especially near the full moon May 23, plus four days. One of you may also have exciting news to share. It’s a special month!</p>
<p>Your ruler Jupiter will make his historic move into Gemini this month on May 25 for the first time since June 2012 to June 2013. Gemini is an air sign that blends beautifully with your fire-sign Sagittarian element. A wedding may be in your future if you are dating and feeling positive about having found your one truelove. You can use this energy to make highly successful, serious business relationships, too. I will have lots to tell you next month, so come back to get the entire scoop!</p>
