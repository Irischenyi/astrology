        <p>This will be a landmark month for you, for it will bring all of your efforts to advance your career and reputation to a pinnacle. Ever since good-fortune Jupiter entered your most prestigious career sector, your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement, in May 2023, you were promised a chance to see enormous professional reward for the excellence of your past efforts.</p>
<p>Your tenth house is the place in the horoscope that reflects your highest contributions to your community, your company, and eventually, as you become older and more mature, to the world at large. It also rules your reputation (what you will be known for now) and your legacy (how you will be remembered). Every person is capable of making a unique contribution to society.</p>
<p>This has been your year to achieve your biggest career successes, and it will all accelerate at the new moon on May 7 when the new moon’s entourage—the Sun, Venus, Uranus, and Jupiter—will crowd together in the sector located at the top of your chart, called the midheaven point or tenth house. Rarely have you had such a superb opportunity to move up and make a name for yourself in your industry.</p>
<p>On May 7, Jupiter and Uranus will still be very close (within 5 degrees)—they had made a conjunction last month on April 20, so you may have received a hint of the luck that was to come this month. That conjunction was such a wonderful event, but because Mercury was retrograde in April, the event last month might not have brought a perfect outcome (it may need tweaking), but nevertheless, it’s clear that so much good was on the way to you professionally. (If you didn’t know, Mercury went direct on April 25, ending weeks of misunderstandings, haywire technical problems, faulty thinking, redos, and more. The road ahead is clear now, and Jupiter and Uranus can still work together to bring blessings to your life.)</p>

        <p>You are ruled by the Sun, and the new moon on May 7 has Uranus conjunct the Sun, so a twist of fate, a piece of surprising last-minute news, or something else is likely to come up suddenly to help you reach for the stars in your career.</p>
<p>If you have your own company, use the May 7 new moon to ask your publicist to offer the press a story idea about one of your recent triumphs. If you are planning to open the doors of your new business, or if you want to start an advertising or social media campaign for an ongoing project, start on or soon after May 7. Saturn will be beautifully oriented to the Sun and new moon, so the steps you take to advance your career will have weight, importance, and longevity in any direction you choose to go.</p>
<p>This new moon has the potential to bring quite long-lasting results for another reason. Venus will receive comforting rays from Pluto, and this new moon in Taurus will put Venus in charge. The sparkling aspects for you to move up in your career are written everywhere in your chart beginning on May 7, so take action soon after!</p>

        <p>Last year, when Jupiter first entered your career sector on May 16, 2023, the new moon had a number of planets surrounding her, but Jupiter was too far away to allow that new moon to unlock your opportunities. The entry of Jupiter into Taurus last year in May 2023, was, however, the beginning of the promise of big things to come for you professionally.</p>
<p>Now on May 7, the stage is set, and a new moon has a period of influence that spans six months, with the very strongest part coming directly after the new moon appears on May 7. The new moon’s power will gradually decline with each passing day until its energy will have completely evaporated by the full moon in Taurus (the same sign as this new moon)—that full moon is due on November 15, 2024.</p>
<p>You have to partner with the universe to show your desire to make your ascent in your career and to forever cruise on a new, higher level. You can be a leader in the area of your expertise as all the doors are opening for you, one after another.</p>
<p>Once Jupiter leaves this position on May 25, he will not be back to this, your career sector, for 12 years. You will always receive aspects between now and then to advance, but having the planet of good fortune, Jupiter, in your prestigious tenth house of career makes it so much easier to do so. Add the remarkably friendly new moon on May 7 with the number of friendly planets supporting her, and you have a perfect setting for victory. If you don’t do anything, nothing much will happen, but if you do make an initiation this month, the universe will help you every step of the way.</p>
<p>The Luckiest Day of the Year will occur on Saturday, May 18, when the Sun conjuncts Jupiter, but you will feel the energy of this conjunction strongly two days before (May 16 and 17) and two days after (May 19 and 20). It has been 12 years since you have seen the meeting of the Sun and Jupiter in your tenth house of fame and honors, and this will occur now, this month, on May 18.</p>

        <p>Each year we have the Luckiest Day of the Year, always on a different day and time and in a different zodiac sign and place in your chart. This year, all the conditions are perfect for you to advance. Even if you have already scored a victory in recent months, it appears you can do it again. Use this meeting of the mighty Sun and benefic Jupiter to ask for a promotion, interview for a job, or pitch a new client.</p>
<p>Before you arrive at the Luckiest Day of the Year, just AFTER the May 7 new moon appears, consider entering an industry contest—hopefully the winner will be announced on or near the Luckiest Day. This would also be an ideal time to place a new product or service on the market or to sign a contract concerning a new initiative you are ready to make.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to look at the rest of your chart. Last month you had a strong emphasis on travel and international relationships or on import-export. This strong accent will still remain thanks to Mars, the action planet, in Aries. It seems the groundwork you set in April can now take a large leap forward in May.</p>
<p>If you didn’t notice a global influence last month, you may have started a discussion about a media project in publishing or broadcasting, worked on a legal action, or been focused on your pursuit of higher education at a university or college. If you are a teaching assistant at a college, you may have opened talks about a new position you want as professor or concerning a class that you would like to offer students at your current institution.</p>

        <p>Will your life be all about your career in May? No! In this extraordinary month, you have the chance to have fun and enjoy romance, love, and affection, too. Dear Leo, everyone wants to be around you.</p>
<p>The full moon on May 23 will be in highly compatible Sagittarius, 3 degrees, and light your fifth house of true love. All full moons have four to five days of influence after they appear, and sometimes you can depict the full moon’s message two days prior to its appearance.</p>
<p>Pluto, in your house of relationships, will reach out to your ruler the Sun, the brightest star, the full moon, and Venus, too. Neptune will be in the ideal position to signal this full moon in Sagittarius and the Sun in Gemini, adding glamour and an element of compassion and unconditional love to the news that comes up near this full moon.</p>
<p>Pluto is based in Aquarius, your seventh house of committed relationships, so if you are married or in a committed, exclusive relationship, your significant other will do or say something that thrills you. If you are dating seriously, you may receive a proposal for marriage or give one yourself. If you are single, you could meet your one truelove over this full moon. A beautiful social event seems to dot your calendar near this full moon on May 23 (most likely on May 25). It looks like your life will be very social from May 23 straight through the weekend of May 25-27. (In the United States, Memorial Day, a big holiday, falls on Monday, May 27.)</p>

        <p>If you dearly want to have a baby, this full moon on May 23 may bring a pregnancy or the confirmation that you are, indeed, expecting. If you or your partner is pregnant and due, you might have the actual birth now. Alternatively, this would be an ideal time to try for a little one, to visit a fertility expert, or to have an IVF procedure. If you already have a child, you may now decide about how best to help him or her. If you need money to help your child, look into government programs and grants—Saturn, friendly to other planets from his perch in your eighth house, will be working with Mercury to help you find the extra cash.</p>
<p>If you are creative or are paid for your ideas and design skills, you are likely to be coming to the end of a project now and will be very proud of the results.</p>
<p>On May 25, the little planets that have gathered to wish Jupiter goodbye will disband and go their separate ways. Jupiter will sail into Gemini, a very social part of your chart ruling friendship, clubs, and the associations you belong to personally or professionally. Soon Jupiter will begin to work his magic there and help you realize a dream you’ve long hoped to achieve but were never sure you would be able to make happen. The eleventh house is associated with the fulfillment of hopes and wishes.</p>
<p>Your eleventh house, soon brimming with help from Jupiter, also rules the profits made from previous efforts the year before if you are self-employed or work for others in sales and are based on commission. It looks as though the endeavors you completed last year to build a sterling reputation as a wise leader with a strong work ethic will now pay off. You have a wonderful 12 months ahead.</p>
<p>Are you excited yet? I am excited for you!</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>If you are serious about leaving your mark upon the world, this month will give you a sterling opportunity to do so. In many ways the career promise that the good fortune planet Jupiter proclaimed a year ago when he entered Taurus, your prestigious professional sector, may be delivered now. Shining aspects will rain down on you in a flurry, day after day this month, dear Leo. The chance to elevate your position to stratospheric heights can happen just after the new moon on May 7 in Taurus, your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement.</p>
<p>In your prestigious, professional, career leadership sector, the new moon will conjoin lucky Jupiter, surprise planet Uranus, and the Sun, and later in the month, Jupiter will meet up with the planet of happiness and popularity, Venus. It is significant that Venus will be there, for she is the RULER of Taurus, your prestigious professional sector, and will be orbiting so close to Jupiter by month’s end. Venus will be able to provide significant support to help you progress this month. The Sun will accompany the new moon on May 7, and the Sun will reveal the place in life where you shine brightest—your professional arena. This is where the excitement will focus.</p>
<p>All these celestial bodies in Taurus is a signal that you need to stay practical, realistic, and be cognizant of your expenses and profits. With Mars in Aries, you seem to have an international, global link or application to all you are doing these days. If travel and overseas relationships are not part of your life, you may be thinking about an assignment involving the media, a legal matter, or talks having to do with one or more institutions of higher education (colleges and universities).</p>
<p>The mission of this new moon will be to rally the energy of these planets in Taurus, your tenth house, into a single, powerful force to help you gain recognition, a promotion, or an offer for an important position from a competitor. Rarely have you ever seen anything like this because your popularity with higher-ups has never been better. Look for opportunities by discreetly telling certain VIPs that you are interested in entertaining offers. Act after the new moon appears on May 7. A new moon is influential for six months but is at its strongest within the 10 days after it appears.</p>

        <p>This month also holds the Luckiest Day of the Year on Saturday, May 18, when the Sun and Jupiter will combine forces. These two heavenly bodies only meet once a year, always on a different day and in a different house and zodiac sign in your solar chart. You can feel the good fortune of this day as early as Thursday, May 16, and as late as Monday, May 20.</p>
<p>This alignment will give you a rare competitive advantage in career-related matters. On May 16 or 17 you might have a pivotal job interview or meet with the press about a recent victory. This could also be the day an announcement comes out about the new position you’ve been awarded. If self-employed, you may crystalize a major deal or partnership with a new, impressive client. Congratulations will flow to you from friends and colleagues, and you might feel as if you were covered in a blizzard of golden confetti.</p>
<p>Your love life will be accented at the time of the full moon in Sagittarius on May 23, so you may have a major festive event to attend that’s filled with happiness. If you are single, you could meet someone whose chemistry mixes perfectly with yours.</p>
<p>If you are creative, this full moon on May 23 would be the time to show your work to the world—you will be proud of all you’ve done. You will also see an emphasis on pregnancy, birth, and the care of children you might have now. If you have had a dilemma, you will make a decision about how to help your child at this full moon.</p>

        <p>In a month when you will see so much professional progress—and an influx of money—be careful not to make your partner feel deficient in comparison. You may not consciously mean to hurt your partner’s feelings, but he or she might be super-sensitive, and doubly so if their own career is not racking nearly as many stellar accolades as you are likely to receive now.</p>
<p>A different way this full moon could work out is if you’re ready to present a creative project complete with a flourish of trumpets blaring. Anything that you launch near the full moon on May 23 should be a jewel in your crown.</p>
<p>The final possibility is that you might find out you or your partner is pregnant, just at a time when your career is in full bloom. If you are not ready for a baby, be careful. If you ARE happy to hear this and are prepared to have a child, just laugh—joyous events often come in doubles. You didn’t get to where you are in your career without superb organizational talents. You’ve got this, dear Leo.</p>
