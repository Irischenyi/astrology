        <p>This is a month just made for you. Many planets are stacking up in compatible Taurus in your third house of communication. Ever since Jupiter entered Taurus in May 2023, you’ve likely seen progress in your ability to express yourself effectively with a new level of sophistication, style, and expertise.</p>
<p>You seem to have come a long way, and your ability for writing, speaking, editing, coding, researching, or translating grew in the past year. You are ready for more complex projects, and it will feel good when you get praise and applause for having done such a stellar job on them.</p>
<p>This month, Jupiter, planet of good fortune, is getting ready to leave Taurus and your communication sector on May 25, not to return to Taurus and this part of your chart again until April 2035. When a big planet like Jupiter changes signs, that’s headline new. The goodness, growth, and opportunity that Jupiter brought you in the past 12 months will now reach a peak in May and burst your talent to full flower.</p>
<p>To send Jupiter off with a flurry, the little planets are gathering together to throw Jupiter a going-away party. All the planets are in a happy mood and getting along famously with each other.</p>

        <p>The cosmic party will begin on May 7 when the new moon appears in Taurus at 18 degrees. This new moon will likely bring you an opportunity to show off your well-honed skills in the communications areas I just mentioned, including writing, speaking, researching, or coding, as some examples. The new moon will be accompanied by the Sun (favor from authority), Venus (happiness and fun), Uranus (surprises), and of course, the guest of honor, Jupiter (good fortune, generosity, and financial growth). All these planets are in the fertile earth sign of Taurus, a sign that mixes well with your water-element of Pisces. Water and earth produce flowers.</p>
<p>It looks like you will be tapped for a new assignment that will lean on your growing sophistication in the communication arts. The offer will likely come up suddenly (thanks to Uranus) and be an assignment that you will enjoy (thanks to Venus). Also, Jupiter and Uranus are orbiting close to each other this month, so that suggests you would be paid well, too.</p>
<p>To have five heavenly bodies in one house is impressive—that adds up to half the solar system in one little slice of the of your chart, and these planets will bring lots of energy. Venus will be in the lead and will be in conversation with Pluto later in the month, suggesting things will work out well financially.</p>
<blockquote><p>You will have your cake and eat it too—wonderful career news, and at the same time glamorous romance, all under the same May 23 full moon.</p></blockquote>

        <p>You may be asked to write a manuscript or work on your own screenplay, or you may be finding the right words for a character in a novel you will start. Alternatively, you may be describing a company in an annual report. You may prepare a press release for a client, be tapped to design, strategize, and write an advertising campaign, come up with a social media effort, or reorganize a website for your client. You may be working on a new app or game you designed that you’ll want to put on the market. There are many possibilities.</p>
<p>Your third house, Taurus, where all the planets will be partying through most of May, also rules nearby travel, so you may spontaneously go out of town for a change of scene. You may be leaving town to visit your sister, brother, or cousin because the third house, so lit up for you, rules these close kin.</p>
<p>Saturn is too far away in the constellation of Pisces to attend the party for Jupiter and instead will send his friendly warm wishes. Saturn in Pisces and Jupiter in Taurus is a great combination, forming a favorable sextile (giving you an opportunity to excel). Saturn has been working on developing your self-discipline and your ability to focus on a great deal of detail. Saturn is also associated with long-term gain, so you will carry with you all that you’ve learned during the past year as you move forward.</p>
<p>Neptune is also in Pisces and, like Saturn, is too far away from Taurus to get to Jupiter’s send-off party, so he will send his gift of creativity, imagination, and stylish taste to the new moon and to you this month. Neptune is your modern ruler and Jupiter is your ancient ruler, and both are being cordial to each other and to the new moon, which bodes so well for you.</p>

        <p>Pisces born near March 8, plus or minus four days, will do best under this new moon. The same is true is you have Pisces rising 18 degrees or your natal moon is in Pisces at that degree, and in both cases, plus or minus four degrees. The is also true if you have a planet in Pisces, Cancer, Scorpio, Taurus, Virgo, or Capricorn at 18 degrees, plus or minus four degrees—if you do, that planet will light up and help you.</p>
<p>Pluto is in Aquarius, also too far away to attend the party, but later, on May 23, Pluto will contact Venus, mistress of ceremonies for the cosmic party, just as the party is wrapping up. Pluto will send Venus a passionate vibration, which might translate into a highly romantic trip out of town for you, one that is close to your home base. You would likely go May 23 to May 27.</p>
<p>Pluto will catch up with his friend Jupiter next month on June 2, a day worthy of five stars, when Pluto and Jupiter will find ways for you to build wealth and career success through real estate. Make a note of June 2—it is a big feature of 2024. Jupiter and Pluto rarely interact, but when they do in a friendly way (like June 2), it is considered a cosmic signature of success.</p>
<p>In this magical month, we also have the Luckiest Day of the Year, May 18, influential for a plus or minus two days. This day would be ideal for taking a quick trip, for the Sun and Jupiter will align in Taurus in your short-distance travel sector. The Sun aligns with Jupiter only once a year, so take note of this special day.</p>

        <p>This same area of the chart rules contracts, so if you have one to sign, May 18, plus or minus two days, would be an ideal time to do so, especially if you see the potential of a large profit.</p>
<p>Also, on the Luckiest Day of the Year, when the Sun and Jupiter align perfectly, May 18, you might give a speech or send in your finished manuscript for a book you hope to have published. You can start a podcast series, do important publicity for a recent victory, send lyrics to songs you wrote to a potential agent, or present an idea for a publicity or advertising campaign to a client within two days (before or after) of May 18,</p>
<p>If you place a new product on the market at this time of the month (as close to May 18 as possible), it should be quite a blockbuster. I gave you some examples of the types of things you might do to get you thinking—it all has to do with the universe sending you enticing opportunities for having so beautifully sharpened your communication skills over the past year. Look for them, for you will find those chances will stand out. Jupiter always brings profit, so this is your time of reward.</p>
<p>Mars is now traveling through your second house of earned income, so it seems you will be spending more money than usual this month. This flow outward will calm down once Mars leaves Aries on June 8.</p>

        <p>A shot of very good news concerning your career is likely to come at the full moon in Sagittarius at 3 degrees on May 23. Give this date a period of influence of five extra days. This will be a major moment—praise will be heaped on you, and doors will open that had been previously closed to you. Both Neptune (your modern ruler) and Pluto will be beautifully oriented toward this full moon. You will come before the public, and people in your industry will be talking about in you in attractive terms.</p>
<p>If you have been interviewing for a new job or angling for a promotion or pitching a prestigious client, you will likely find out who the company chose. If you find out at this full moon, there is a very good chance the person they selected will be you. Indeed, this will be your most important full moon of the year for professional matters. I cannot see your unique chart from where I sit, so there’s no predestination involved, but from what I can see, you are making a fine impression with the VIPs who matter.</p>
<p>Concurrently, on this same day, May 23, Venus will conjunct Jupiter and Neptune will be sextile to both Venus and Jupiter. Sextiles bring on delicious opportunities. This is remarkable. This full moon should be magical for love and romance. It looks as though you will have your cake and eat it too—wonderful career news, and at the same time glamorous romance, all under the same full moon. Wow! Again, a trip out of town would work so very well for you.</p>
<p>In a month that seems to have everything, there is still more news! On May 25, Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, will move to your home living sector, which also rules other property you might own, rent, or would like to buy or sell. Additionally, your parents come under this house, and Jupiter will remain in your home sector over a year, from May 25, 2024, to June 9, 2025.</p>

        <p>If you have hoped to buy or sell a house or an apartment, the coming 12 months would be the time to do so. You will get your best possible price for selling property, and if you are buying, you may spend a little more than you had estimated you would spend, but the great value you receive in return would more than make up for the higher cost. Family support for your ideas will be sky high.</p>
<p>Jupiter only visits your home and family sector every 12 years, and your year is about to begin. You will see lots of emphasis on this area next month. This is your once-in-a-12-year chance to turn your home into your castle. If you are trying to help a parent or other family member, you will find the right answer soon.</p>
<p>All systems are showing green lights for you! You will love your home so much you won’t want to leave it!</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>As a Pisces, you are known to be intensely creative and especially strong with artistic work, for your imagination is legendary, and you are capable of producing works of great beauty. Visual art is usually your currency, for as a Pisces you take in the world through the right side of your brain—the side that processes information not through words but rather through gesture, body language, symbols, color, and other non-verbal methods.</p>

        <p>Your intuition is the sharpest of any of the 12 signs in the zodiac. You can instantly know if a person’s words match their true intent simply by taking notice of their fleeting facial expressions and tone and inflection of voice.</p>
<p>In recent yeas, slow moving powerful planets—Uranus and Jupiter—have been emphasizing the left, more analytical, word-oriented side of your brain from their position in your third house of communication. These planets have been urging you to develop your abilities in writing, speaking, research, and possibly also in editing, coding, or language translation. This is an unusual trend that has been going on in you for several years through the effort of other planets, and eclipses, too.</p>
<p>In May, much of your innate right-brain skills will merge with your left-brain skills that you’ve honed and will now bring you to the point of reward. A major assignment or opportunity is on the way, dear Pisces. When it arrives, you will find it to be very welcome news.</p>
<p>You have five heavenly bodies in the constellation of Taurus, an earth sign that blends magnificently with water-sign Pisces. Three transiting planets are all crowded in Taurus and your third house of communication. They are Venus, Uranus, and Jupiter along with the Sun and new moon, May 7. The new moon will take the gifts of these planets and bring opportunity for you in this realm of communications. Watch what happens after the new moon appears May 7. All you have put into honing your skills could begin to be recognized at this time.</p>

        <p>The Luckiest Day of the Year will be May 18, when good-fortune Jupiter will align with the mighty Sun in Taurus in the same communications-oriented sector of your chart. Sign a contract or publish a new book within two days of May 18, for if you do, you will fulfill the profit potential you see from the venture and may go far above it.</p>
<p>If you have been working on an app or video game, or if you are ready to bring it to market, that’s your date to schedule it. Send in a query letter to an editor, or show your screenplay to a major motion picture studio. Launch an advertising, social media, publicity, or other self-promotion campaign. If you are working in communications, there is no question that May 18 is your date to reveal something big.</p>
<p>Your third house, so lit up most of the month (and especially on May 18), also rules travel, so you may also find you are on a plane heading to a mountainous region at some point and enjoying every minute.</p>
<p>The full moon May 23 could easily become an exciting and memorable professional moment, for this full moon in Sagittarius will light your prestigious tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement. Your visibility in your industry will rise, and the applause for you could be quite thunderous.</p>

        <p>Jupiter will be the most prominent planet at the full moon May 23, and again your evolving skills in communication will be at the core of your success. At this full moon, Jupiter will be close to Uranus, so news (good news!) will appear as a complete surprise.</p>
<p>Indeed, the May 23 full moon (plus five days) will be one of the most important moments of the year for your career. This full moon will receive supportive, powerful vibrations from your ruling planet Neptune and also from mover-and-shaker Pluto. A VIP has noticed your work and will likely reach out to you. The harder you have worked, the bigger this moment it will be. It’s all so very exciting</p>
<p>On May 25, Jupiter will leave your communications sector to work on your most private home life. It took Jupiter 12 years to arrive at this place in your chart, and he will remain there a full year, from May 25, 2024, to June 9, 2025.</p>

        <p>You have given a lot to your career in recent years, and now you can turn your home into the comfortable, stylish, haven against the world for you and those you share your space with you have always wanted. You can move, paint, make repairs, renovate, buy new furniture and redecorate, or buy additional property (such as a vacation home or a structure to make into a Airbnb). If you move, you are likely to move into a very spacious home with big closets and plenty of sunshine and a view. If that describes your present home, you can renovate to make it even better. The sky’s the limit to what you can do.</p>
<p>If you have been concerned over the welfare of a parent, you will find ways to help your beloved mother or father. This is true even if you had not found the answer previously.</p>
<p>This new home and family trend is just shaping up, but you will see solid evidence of this by the June 6 new moon. It will be an exciting ride.</p>
