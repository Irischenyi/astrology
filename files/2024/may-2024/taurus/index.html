        <p>There’s a dazzling party shaping up in the constellation of Taurus, for many little planets are gathering to wish Jupiter good-bye as he gets ready to leave your sign on May 25. Before Jupiter leaves to go to the Gemini constellation, the planets have planned big month-long going-away party with a plethora of events, each one more exciting than the first.</p>
<p>The big party kicks off at the new moon in Taurus, 18 degrees, on May 7 and the many days that follow. When the elegant new moon arrives, she will be accompanied by her partner, the Sun, your ruler Venus, good-fortune Jupiter, and surprise-a-minute Uranus. All those planets will be in Taurus, happily sipping champagne in your solar first house, accenting and celebrating your uniqueness, identity, personality, vitality, determination, and will.</p>
<p>All the planets are on the eastern portion of your chart, indicating you will be in control of the course of events this month, and you won’t need anyone to help you find opportunities. You can find them yourself, and the ones you do uncover will be better than any that others could find for you on your behalf. In other words, you are the engine that will bring in all your luck.</p>
<p>Jupiter and Uranus will still be close after their recent conjunction, which you experienced on April 20. By the new moon, May 7, these two planets will still be close enough (within 3 degrees) to be significant mathematically, so these two major titans of the solar system will keep things exciting.</p>

        <p>But wait—Venus, your guardian planet, will be among the planets in Taurus and at the time of the new moon will receive comforting vibrations from Saturn, the planet that promotes a feeling of security. Saturn is not in Taurus but in highly compatible Pisces, and when joining force with Venus, promotes stable relationships. Saturn is positioned in your eleventh house of friendships, so an older friend or mentor can be very helpful to you in suggesting how to reach a goal. With the new moon, Sun, Venus, Uranus, and Jupiter all in Taurus, you will be unstoppable. You can get things your way, so don’t hesitate to voice your preferences and desires.</p>
<p>Whatever you begin on or near the days that follow the new moon, May 7, will have a good chance for long-term gain. Five heavenly bodies in Taurus adds up to half the heavenly bodies in our solar system, and they are standing by to shower you with luck and opportunity. You can make great progress in the area of love and romance, career, friendship, and health. I did not mention money, but that comes later, so stay with me.</p>
<p>If there is a VIP you need to see, present an idea to, or require help from to get to the next level, make your appointment quickly, for you have to do so prior to Jupiter’s departure of Taurus on May 25. Once Jupiter, the planet of good fortune, leaves to enter Gemini on May 25, he will not be back to Taurus for 12 years. While you will always have special aspects each month to capture your goals, this month sparkles at an extraordinary level, making it far easier for you to reach a goal. With Jupiter in Taurus, you are, after all, the current celestial favorite of all signs.</p>
<blockquote><p>Venus (love, luxury, money) will be meeting with good-fortune Jupiter in Taurus at the full moon May 23. This is as good as it gets.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Mother’s Day in America falls on Sunday, May 12, and the transiting moon will be in Cancer, the sign of family, a perfect place for the moon to be to have fun with mother and to honor her for all she has done for you.</p>
<p>The following day, Monday, May 13, has the Sun conjoining unpredictable Uranus in Taurus. This day will be filled with surprises, and some of the aspects prevalent will spill over on the day before and after. If your birthday falls on May 13, plus or minus three days, your entire year will bring unexpected developments. Uranus’ influence often creates surprises that could be positive or not so positive, but not this time—with luck, happiness, and growth planet Jupiter flying so close to Uranus, I feel you will be thrilled with the surprises that come up. I cannot see everything in you chart, but from what I can see, it surely looks spectacular.</p>
<p>Here comes more news! Every year we get the Luckiest Day of the Year when the Sun meets with Jupiter. This year these two power bodies of good news will meet in Taurus on May 18. Wow! This will be the first time in 12 years the mighty Sun and Jupiter will meet in your sign, so you are due for quite a breakthrough. You will want to be part of this, so make an initiation. You will feel this aspect with a plus or minus two days.</p>
<p>If you are a Taurus born on or within days of this date (May 18), you will be showered with golden confetti during your entire birthday year ahead. (If you have ever heard the term “solar return,” that is what I am speaking of—when the Sun returns to the place it occupied at your birth.) If your birthday falls within five days of May 18, increasingly, you will find that you are at the right place at precisely the right time to take advantage of a plethora of opportunities.</p>
<p>For now, you may be wondering no matter when your Taurus birthday falls, how should you use this Luckiest Day of the Year? Plan to do something that you feel a little scared to do or would be hard to accomplish. It would be an action you would want to take if you had an extra, secret element of luck on your side to give you a boost or edge in the matter. Use it for a job interview, a first date, to give a speech, to meet the press, to ask for a raise, or to make a major presentation to a client. You get the idea—when you need to take action on something that you deeply want to bring a positive outcome. Remember, May 18 has a plus or minus two days of influence.</p>

        <p>The full moon on May 23 in Sagittarius at 3 degrees will turn your attention to finances. This full moon puts generous Jupiter in the lead, and remarkably, Jupiter will be conjunct Venus, your ruler, dear Taurus. Venus is the planet that has the job of taking good care of you, and lo and behold, Venus will be meeting with the planet of good fortune in Taurus. This is as good as it gets.</p>
<p>Venus is not only about love, beauty, and luxury. Those area will absolutely shine for you on the May 23 full moon, plus five days, but Venus also has a strong financial side to her, and this particular full moon will be mainly about money.</p>
<p>Additionally, Saturn, too, will be in beautiful sync with your ruler Venus, giving you comfort from friends and good advice from one older friend as well.</p>
<p>At this full moon, you may be paying bills, but you may also make a large purchase that you have been looking forward to for a while. (Mercury is no longer retrograde like it was in April, so go ahead, shop!) Alternatively, you may receive a large bundle of cash, either as a commission, royalty, advance, bonus, special project fee, insurance payout, bank loan, mortgage, infusion of venture capital, inheritance, or a court or legal settlement decided in your favor. There are other possible sources, but you see the types of funds that may come your way—sources outside your normal salary.</p>
<p>Your career should show surprising breakthroughs and a stunning uptick thanks to Jupiter’s interplay with Pluto. Pluto is currently occupying your tenth house of fame and honors. This suggests VIPs are impressed with your work, and you may get special recognition either through publicity, praise, or a promotion, and whatever happens, you won’t see it coming.</p>

        <p>If money comes in to you, it is more likely to come in as a one-time package rather than an increase in salary. I can’t entirely rule out a salary increase for you because by the full moon, May 23, the Sun, giver of life and strength, will have moved into your second house of earned income and salary. The full moon is lighting your eighth house, but the energy falling in that house (which rules one-time lumps of cash) can often bounce back and forth to the opposite house—your second house of salary. One way or another you certainly will have the Midas touch at the full moon.</p>
<p>This is only the beginning, dear Taurus, for there is another reason you can look forward to a financial bonanza from now on.</p>
<p>On May 25, Jupiter, the great benefic, will move into your financial second house of earned income, salary, and possessions for a year, until June 9, 2025.</p>
<p>This will be the first time in 12 years that you will have hosted Jupiter in this section of your chart. The last time this happened was from June 11, 2012, to June 25, 2013. Back in those years, Saturn was opposed to your Sun, a difficult and severe aspect, that lessened the bounty of Jupiter. You may not feel that that period, mid-2012 to mid-2013, was all that special. However, now you don’t have Saturn opposed to your Taurus Sun. For this reason, I feel you are entering the finest financial year of your life, far better than the last time you hosted Jupiter in Gemini.</p>
<p>In the past 12 months, you experienced your Emerald Year (with Jupiter in Taurus), and now, you will enter into the second gestation of the Jupiter cycle, the time when you will likely see your bounteous harvest unfold. Your abundant financials will be directly related to the seeds you planted last year while Jupiter was in Taurus. You were busy meeting people, presenting your ideas, working hard to get ahead, and people were impressed. Now, as Jupiter moves forward into Gemini, you will see the fruits of your labors.</p>

        <p>To be sure you notice the new type of luck you are about to experience thanks to Jupiter to Gemini, the universe has planned to have Pluto as the first planet to officially greet Jupiter in his new home of Gemini. When Pluto meets with Jupiter in the chart, it is always considered a signature of success, particularly financial success. The date this will happen next month will be June 2.</p>
<p>That “trine” (supreme harmony) between Pluto and Jupiter will create a golden link between Jupiter in your money sector (second house) and Pluto in your prestigious career sector (tenth house). This aspect is rare and won’t occur again in the same signs until August 2036. It is that special.</p>
<p>June 2 is a Sunday, but you will feel this energy earlier, from May 30 to June 4. May 30 and May 31 will be wonderful. Skip June 3 as the moon will be void for many hours. (Check my Moonlight Phases app for exact timing of the moon in your location. I built GPS into all my apps. My Moonlight Phases app is a one-time purchase of $7.99 and not a subscription. It is available on Apple App Store and Google Play.)</p>
<p>I like June 4 better than June 3 for you anyway, not only because the moon is not in lackadaisical void-of-course, but also because the transiting moon will be in Taurus.</p>
<p>American readers may wonder when the US Memorial Day weekend will fall. The holiday will span May 25 to May 27—so plan to be back at work the next day, May 28. The week from May 29 to June 4 is too special to miss. Don’t take those days off!</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Birthday month is shaping up perfectly for you. Rarely have you seen as many heavenly bodies lining up in Taurus to wish you a best personal year ahead. You have the Sun and new moon on May 7, along with Venus (your guardian planet), Uranus, and Jupiter all in Taurus—that is five heavenly bodies, representing half the solar system. You are in a rare place in time where so many of your wishes can be realized this month and in the months ahead. Hands down, May will be your favorite month of the year.</p>
<p>Mercury was retrograde last month, but that was then and this is now, and instead of seeing delays and postponements as you did last month, you will be moving quickly forward in May. Start your biggest initiations after the new moon in Taurus, May 7, one of the best we’ve seen in ages. This new moon will put your interests front and center, ahead of others, so spend time thinking about what would make you happy.</p>
<p>In the coming 12 months, prioritize your dreams, and start to work on materializing one just after the new moon, May 7. You will have beneficial months ahead, powerful enough to change your life for the better. A new moon has a long reach, and that’s good news when you have a birthday new moon like this one that is as sweet as sugar for you.</p>

        <p>You will no longer be impeded by difficult eclipses in Taurus and Scorpio either, such as the ones you had to endure from late 2021 through 2022 and 2023. The last one appeared in October 2023. You are finished, and no eclipses in Taurus or your opposite sign of Scorpio are due back until 2031. You may have felt pushed and pulled by eclipses because Uranus, the planet of all things unexpected, was orbiting at precisely the wrong place at the wrong time for you. That’s over and done!</p>
<p>You will be a compelling virtual idea factory on May 13, the day the Sun conjoins Uranus in Taurus. Out-of-the-box thinking will benefit you in your career. Uranus is the planet that governs your career, so exciting news could materialize on this day. At the time of this aspect, Mars will be filling your confidential sector, so you may be engaged in secret talks, having a professional job interview, or planning an important competitive strategy for your company.</p>
<p>The Luckiest Day of the Year happens on May 18 when Jupiter will meet with the Sun—in Taurus. Use this day to try for something difficult you want to achieve or to ensure things will go your way. Some examples of how you can use the Luckiest Day would be to close on a house, go on a first date, schedule a job interview, ask for a promotion, or get married (over the weekend of May 18-19). This day will have a plus or minus of two days. Dear Taurus, you will be luckier than a leprechaun.</p>

        <p>You will likely be doing financial management or negotiation or tweaking your savings portfolio within five days of the full moon May 23 in Sagittarius. You may be given a valuable gift, such as jewelry, a gift card from a fine retailer, or cash, as a slightly belated birthday present.</p>
<p>This full moon on May 23 will be perfectly delicious for you. It also appears to be connected to your work, for Pluto, newly in your prestigious tenth house of career sector, will be friendly to this full moon. If you are negotiating a new bonus, benefits package, or how commissions or royalties will be calculated, this would be an ideal time to finish it and sign on the dotted line.</p>
<p>Another big day will arrive on May 25 when Jupiter will leave Taurus. No tears on your pillow—all the work you did to elevate your standing in your industry over the past 12 months will now become ripe for harvest. You are entering one of the most successful, abundant financial years in over a decade. You have so much to celebrate!</p>
