        <p>Dear Capricorn, May will be an extraordinary month for you. It is as if the universe captured all its best, most dazzling aspects of the year and carefully dropped each one, as precious as diamonds, into a tiny velvet drawstring bag. The cosmos has waited until the calendar came to May to open this black velvet pouch and spill all these gorgeous aspects across the evening skies.</p>
<p>Over the past months, the planets have been speaking clearly. Since January, many of the planets have been traveling closely together, moving in a different sign and house of your horoscope each month. When they journey together like this, you would notice their strong, distinct messages. This month the planets are crowded in Taurus, an earth sign like yours, meaning each heavenly body will find a way to support you fully. Jupiter, the great benefic and giver of gifts and luck, has now spent a full year in Taurus and is due to leave for Gemini on May 25.</p>
<p>Before Jupiter makes his departure, the little planets have decided to give him a fantastic going-away party, and you are invited, too.</p>
<p>This party will kick off on May 7, the date of the new moon in Taurus, 18 degrees. This new moon will arrive with her partner the Sun, and Venus will be the mistress of ceremonies as she will take the lead during this lunar event. Uranus, the planet of surprise, will be in attendance, along with the guest of honor and every planet’s friend, Jupiter. This new moon is brimming with sugar and spice and is filled with opportunity. All of these planets are getting along beautifully with each other. These five heavenly bodies will be filling your fifth house of true love.</p>

        <p>It’s time to push back from your computer and think of ways to enrich your personal, emotional life.</p>
<p>Saturn can’t make the party as he is on assignment in the constellation of Pisces, but he will send his warmest greetings to the planets in Taurus through a sextile aspect (opportunity). Saturn is your ruler, so the fact that Saturn will bolster this new moon’s work is significant. Neptune is in Pisces, too, and he will send his congratulations to Jupiter in an equally warm and supportive way.</p>
<p>Pluto, newly minted in Aquarius in your earned income sector (second house), will be supportive too, and he will help you find ways to build wealth. He will be too busy doing that to attend the party, but Pluto will send his greetings later in the month to Venus, who is heading the event, and that will increase your capacity for intense emotional passion.</p>
<blockquote><p>You will have an amazing month filled with all kinds of happy circumstances. Life can’t always be this sweet, but it will be now—so take full advantage!</p></blockquote>

        <p>Pluto will catch up with Jupiter next month on June 2 to wish him congratulations as they create a stunningly positive aspect that should bring you and others great prosperity. June 2 deserves a shiny gold star on your calendar. Use this date to sign contracts, pitch a client, open the door of your new business, or introduce a new product or service, or for any other exciting professional pursuit.</p>
<p>So many celestial bodies will be in Taurus that they will—when you count them—represent half of the solar system (the new moon, the Sun, Venus, Uranus, and Jupiter). Wonderful things will start happening after the new moon appears on May 7, and this will continue over the days and weeks to come—love and fun will be back on your agenda.</p>
<p>You may have fallen in love over the past 12 months because Jupiter, your benefactor, was in Taurus, working hard to help you to meet new romantic interests. If not, you still have until May 25, when Jupiter moves into Gemini, to circulate. If you are attached, you will receive lots of attention and affection from your spouse this month.</p>
<p>Often when a major planet (Jupiter) is getting ready to make a historic move into a new sign, the universe gathers the little planets together to surround that departing planet and put in motion a last-minute show of enormous intensity so that you can take full advantage of the opportunities still in play.</p>
<p>Let me put it this way. Have you and your friends ever come to a fine restaurant you’d always wanted to visit, but you got there late at night and hungry? Still, it was fun to catch up with the friends who you’ve not seen in a while, but you may have been startled to hear the waitress say, “Last call for drinks and for your dinner order—the kitchen will close at midnight. It is now 11:40 PM.”</p>

        <p>That’s what is happening here. You need to clear your schedule to make time for your private, emotional life, which is just as important as your public, professional life (which I know you value). No matter what your marital status is, this applies to you.</p>
<p>If you are single and want to meet someone, you will need to get yourself organized and venture out. Things happen when you leave the house. You still have time to enjoy these madly romantic aspects and find long lasting, genuine love (not a fling). If you are single, you may have fallen in love this year, but if you say you haven’t, Jupiter will be in your romance sector until May 25, and he is standing by to help you.</p>
<p>If you are attached, you can recapture the fun you had when you first met, only this time your love will be even deeper because you know one another so well. You can now receive more attention from your partner, so plan something exciting to do together this month. You can also choose a long-term goal that is equally exciting and that you can work on side by side.</p>
<p>While it is true that other planets and aspects will come up as you proceed, having Jupiter in your fifth house of true love is a great advantage, and it will be amplified by all the other heavenly bodies in Taurus (including this powerful new moon)—this is a spectacular situation. It may now be easier than ever before to find genuine, lasting love.</p>

        <p>Most of the time, a new moon is helpful but not perfect, yet this new moon is as close to perfect as I have ever seen. You usually don’t have a crowd of happy planets in your house of true love. Once good-fortune Jupiter leaves, he will not be back in Taurus and your solar love sector again until April 2035. While nothing is guaranteed or predestined in astrology, and I cannot see everything you have in your unique natal chart, from what I can see, this is as good as it gets.</p>
<p>Additionally, a new moon’s influence doesn’t just last for a day or one week—it has a long tail and will help you find love for six months. A new moon will be strongest when it appears and very gradually decline in strength as it comes closer to the full moon in the same sign (Taurus), which will happen on November 15. As you see, my little description of the waitress is not exactly accurate—you will have more time—but I admit, this month is one of your best.</p>
<p>The ancient astrologers wrote a great deal about the association of the fifth house (where all the action is for you this month), which also rules pregnancy, birth, and the care of children. If you want children, start to get serious about moving on this desire now. If you have had problems with conception, don’t delay in consulting a fertility doctor to find out the reason. If you do not want a baby (or any children for that matter), be very careful because Jupiter will assume you think having a baby now would be a good idea.</p>
<p>With your fifth house brimming with energy, your creativity and imagination will be working at an all-time high this month. If you are writing a novel or screenplay, making a portfolio of poetry, or working on a new collection of photographs, as some examples, you will be pleased with your output. Any and all who work in a creative field will be boosted by these planets in Taurus, so if you are a painter, sculptor, choreographer, illustrator, cinematographer, director, or even an actor, give your craft time and attention.</p>

        <p>The Luckiest Day of the Year, a five-star day, will occur on May 18 when the mighty Sun (the giver of all life and strength) conjoins Jupiter (the planet of happiness, good fortune, growth, and often, if appropriate, financial gain). Give this date a plus or minus two days on either side of May 18 (the days preceding May 18 will be a little stronger).</p>
<p>Use the Luckiest Day to do something you feel you’d like to have an edge of luck to accomplish. Schedule a first date, or if attached, surprise your partner with an event you’ve secretly planned. Place a new product you’ve designed on the market, or present a creative idea to an influential VIP whose approval and funding you might need. Publish your e-book.</p>
<p>Or treat yourself to something indulgent, such as a treatment at a spa, a grand dinner in a restaurant you’ve read about and have always wanted to try—celebrate something! This day is due to be highly romantic, so you might use it to take an overnight trip in the countryside to a beautiful inn to spend quality time with your one and only.</p>
<p>One reader wrote to ask me, why do you tell us what to do occasionally in your forecast? The answer is, I don’t mean to tell you how to use the day, but I want to give you examples of the types of things you could do to stimulate your own thinking. May 18 will be a gorgeous day, and it would be a shame not to use it for something special.</p>

        <p>This month’s full moon will fall on May 23 in Sagittarius, 3 degrees, and will light your twelfth house. By this time, you will likely be winding down and in need of privacy and rest. This is a house where confidential talks should take place before you share your project with the world. (Next month there will be a friendly full moon in Capricorn on June 21, and you might be ready to shout your news from the rooftops then.)</p>
<p>This month’s full moon will be friendly. Pluto is in your second house of earned income, so you may be signing an important contract that has the potential to make you quite a bit of money. If you work in a creative realm, you might be spending time alone to think about how you will approach a new project.</p>
<p>Neptune will be well oriented to this full moon on May 23. Neptune is moving very close to your home sector, so you may be working on a renovation, refresh, or completely new décor, and because Neptune rules the arts, your ideas are likely to be quite beautiful and reflective of the true you.</p>
<p>One note of warning: If you are moving to a new apartment or house, be sure you have flood protection in your homeowner’s or renter’s insurance policy. Flood or water damage does not generally come with insurance, so you would have to ask for a rider. With Neptune about to enter Aries, your home sector, to stay from 2025 to 2038, you need this provision because Neptune will occasionally want to bring the sea (which he rules) with him into your home—you don’t want him there, so get this insurance just in case.</p>

        <p>On May 25 Jupiter will make his monumental move into Gemini and your sixth house of work projects. He will be greeted by the Sun and Venus (who are already there), and at the time the new moon arrives on June 6, another celebration will commence to welcome Jupiter into his new home, where he will remain until June 9, 2025. Mercury will also be present by the June 6 new moon, and because Mercury is Gemini’s ruler, he will be the master of ceremonies, getting all the details ready for the guest of honor, Jupiter.</p>
<p>Once Jupiter moves into Gemini, you will see a change in your mood—your attention will shift to your projects, and by next month’s new moon on June 6, you will be able to discuss them with colleagues, friends, and family. Gemini is a “double bodied” sign (the sign of the Twins), so you may receive two major projects at the same time. Business will move at a fast pace, and you might need to find qualified people to help you get all the orders out. I will discuss more of the ramifications of Jupiter in Gemini with you next month.</p>
<p>Your sixth house is also the area of your chart where you take action to stay strong and healthy. You will be able to improve your nutrition, get more exercise, and have all those annual screenings with your doctor or dentist that you know you should do.</p>
<p>In the meantime, an absolutely enchanting aspect will happen concurrent to the full moon on May 23. Venus will align perfectly with Jupiter, a five-star event that only happens once a year and always in a different sign and place in your chart. This alignment will happen approximately five hours prior to this full moon, and there is something so sweet and tender about it.</p>

        <p>Just as Jupiter is heading for the door—he will be at 29 degrees, 23 minutes Taurus—Venus will rush in and give Jupiter a kiss at the same degree and minute. A planet can only reach 29 degrees 59 minutes before it moves into the next sign, so Jupiter and Venus will both be just a hair’s breadth away from Gemini when Venus meets Jupiter. It has taken Jupiter 12 years to journey to Gemini.</p>
<p>On May 23, at this magical time, Venus and Jupiter will meet in Taurus and your fifth house of true love—it’s like what you would see at the end of a great movie (a love story)—where the music becomes dramatic, reaches a crescendo, and the lovers embrace.</p>
<p>The difference is that this movie is not a sad love story—it is a happy one—and could mark the beginning of a legendary love bond between two people (and you are likely to be one of them). Your fifth house of romance is ruled by Venus, so she is important here.</p>
<p>Additionally, your house of career is also ruled by Venus, so you should have an enchanting experience in love and lots of great news in your career to share at the same time. Use May 25, another five-star day, for an important initiation, either professionally, romantically, or both.</p>

        <p>As you see, you will have an amazing month filled with all kinds of happy circumstances. If you have my Year Ahead 2024 calendar, you may have already noticed other special days along the way in May. Life can’t always be this sweet, but when it is—like this month—take full advantage!</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>The month of May has all the makings of being a rare and extraordinarily enchanting month. This is a month where dreams of love can come true and when the warmth of love can envelope you in a way you’ve rarely, if ever, seen.</p>
<p>At the new moon on May 7, you will have the Sun, new moon, Jupiter, Uranus, and best of all, the planet that rules your house of true love—Venus—happily clustered together. Each planet will be nestled in the perfect-for-you earth-sign Taurus, your fifth house of romance and fun, and conception, birth, and care of children. Artistic expression is also covered in this area of your chart, and if creativity is important to you, your work can now bloom like a magnificent rose.</p>
<p>If you are single, you may see the start of a new and important relationship form before your eyes. This won’t be a casual fling—the planets are lining up to engender genuine love. Watch to see who you meet in the days and several weeks following the new moon on May 7.</p>

        <p>Women Capricorns will much more easily get pregnant this month. This could be joyous news, or if not ready for a child (or not planning to have any children), this might not be such good news. In the latter case, be careful.</p>
<p>Love comes in many different forms. There is the rush of true love at the start when you meet someone, or the deep, mature love that keeps growing and deepening with the one you’ve known and been with for a long time. There is also the special love of children, and the joy of a new baby. Ancient astrologers wrote quite a bit about the importance of the fifth house for having, supporting, and loving children.</p>
<p>There is another way you could use this plethora of loving planetary energy that is gathering in Taurus. Your fifth house is also associated with creativity, imagination, and originality, which, after the new moon on May 7, should blossom beautifully for you. Concentrate on your project, and don’t give up—in a month this special, you will discover that part of you that is unique. The world will be waiting for all you have to show and say—and the universe is listening to the whispers and beating of your heart. Voice that beautiful idea, and the universe will help you in May.</p>
<p>Can you enjoy love AND creativity this month? Yes, because none of these areas are mutually exclusive. This is an extraordinary month, made for romance and fun, and as rare and precious as a perfectly cut, 5-carat diamond.</p>

        <p>While each Capricorn of every birthday will have something to cheer about this month, if your birthday falls between January 6 and January 12, you will feel the energy of the new moon on May 7 with spectacular strength.</p>
<p>This gorgeous month holds the Luckiest Day of the Year on May 18 (plus or minus two days) when the Sun and Jupiter align. The Sun and Jupiter conjoin once a year, each time in a new sign and different part of your chart. This month, for the first time in over a decade, these two heavenly bodies will shine brilliantly in your fifth house of new, true, and deepening love and will also send blessings for the conception and gentle care of children and for expressions of creativity.</p>
<p>You will have such an active month that by the full moon on May 23, you will opt for rest. Withdraw for a time for “me and thee”—you will both need private moments to reflect on the wonderful events that occurred earlier in the month. On this date, Venus will conjoin Jupiter—still another indication of rare and tender loving moments shared, and now with each other in glorious privacy.</p>
<p>Jupiter, which takes 12 years to circle the Sun, will arrive in Gemini on May 25 to warm up your work life and also give you the motivation to improve your health. I have found that Jupiter in the sixth house helps people lose weight, too. No matter what your professional or wellness goals are, Jupiter will help you every step of the way.</p>
<p>You have a dazzling forecast!</p>
