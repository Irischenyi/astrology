        <p>You have a gorgeous chart this month. May has so many gleaming aspects, and each one will give you reason to be happy in a different ways. This month will offer you a lovely balance between your continued skyrocketing career success and unusually strong opportunities for a busy social life. Every month can’t possibly bring the number of many joyous moments that May will bring, so make every effort to live life to the fullest in May.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about your career first. Last month you made great progress impressing VIPs at the top, even if you were not consciously aware of how well you were doing. You are being noticed and admired, and eventually you will see how much you are prized at your company, if you didn’t already see this in April. If you are self-employed, you may have received enviable publicity or a new, prestigious client who has a project that is earmarked just for you.</p>
<p>You had an important eclipse April 8 in your tenth house of career achievement and progress, so you may have seen a high-level person from management leave, changing the dynamics of power in your company. The company hierarchy has become more fluid, less stuck in granite, and this can spell greater opportunity for you to display your talents and to gradually take on more responsibility. You may have seen the title of your job change as you moved up in power—or that will come later, possibly at the next eclipse, October 2.</p>
<p>Mars is now in Aries, the sign the red planet entered on April 30, and will remain until June 8, a period of six weeks. You only get to have energetic, assertive, courageous Mars in this, your tenth house of career every two years. Now you will find it easier than ever to get your foot inside the door of influential people who you need to see. It is likely that you will have at least one career victory, if not more, by the time this month is out.</p>

        <p>Last month Mercury was retrograde and finally went direct on April 25. You won’t have the delays, mix-ups, forgetfulness, and miscommunications in May that you had in last month. Just the opposite, things will move along at a much more rapid clip. Keep in mind, though, that Mercury doesn’t wake up and become functional instantly. Mercury won’t be fully restored to its former strength until May 13, but you don’t have to wait that long to start actions. From May 1 onward you will begin to see your productivity increase with each passing day.</p>
<p>Now for the really big news that I have been anxious to tell you about! The little planets are planning a big celebration for Jupiter’s last days in Taurus in this decade. Jupiter is getting ready to move into Gemini on May 25.</p>
<p>Everything kicks off at the new moon in Taurus, 18 degree, to appear on May 7. Present at the party will be the new moon (opportunity), the Sun (vitality), Venus (fun, romance, social activity), Uranus (surprises), and the star of the show, Jupiter (good fortune).</p>
<blockquote><p>This month could turn out to be a landmark month. You may see a dream dear to your heart realized.</p></blockquote>

        <p>All the activity is being focused on your friends, and you may make one or two new ones now, too. Last month you worked very hard, so this month should be a joyful change, giving you a chance to kick back and reconnect with those closest in your personal life and also with colleagues and friends in your professional life.</p>
<p>This new moon is as sweet as sugar, for it will be conjunct Jupiter! You are ruled by the moon, so this is significant! The new moon’s impending meeting with the planet of good fortune is a wonderful lucky break. This new moon will orbit close not only to Jupiter but also to Uranus, planet of unexpected developments (this time, good ones!). Venus will be present too, also in Taurus, but a little farther away. On this new moon, there are no clouds, only bright blue skies overhead. Surprises, love, and luxury are all in the cards.</p>
<p>Business should be upbeat too, and it looks like there will be a social event you will be looking forward to attending. An event that you attend—or give—is sure to be lovely because Neptune, the planet of dreams and enchantment, will send greetings to Jupiter and to Pluto. In fact, you may get a business or financial tip at the social event that will work out in your favor. Saturn will be speaking with and boosting the Sun and new moon, indicating possible help from a friend or associate who is based in an international city or college campus, or who is works in the media (publishing or broadcasting). Venus will work with Saturn too, indicating you may have special luck related to property you own or to your home or family.</p>
<p>The event you go to in the first half of May might be a wedding, a birthday party, charity ball or fundraiser, or even a seminar or convention. (The Met Gala, the big event in New York City put on by Vogue magazine every year to benefit the Metropolitan Museum, will take place one day prior to the new moon and will be influenced by the planets gathering in sensuous Taurus.)</p>

        <p>The eleventh house, where this gathering of happy planets will take place in your chart, also rules your deepest hopes and wishes, so you may find a way to get closer to a dream, perhaps through a lucky break, allowing you to actually capture that dream.</p>
<p>The Luckiest Day of the Year falls in May, too—on May 18. This IS a fabulous month. Although this annual meeting of the Sun and Jupiter falls on May 18, a Saturday, you will feel the energy strongly building the day prior on May 17. In truth, I should give this date, May 18, a plus or minus two days in influence. Keep in mind all aspects are strongest when you see the two planets moving toward each other (“applying”) as they plan to make their conjunction, rather than slightly after they have already met (“separating”).</p>
<p>Each year we have a Luckiest Day when Jupiter meets with the Sun. They always meet in a different sign and place in your chart. How can you use this rare energy? A friend may come to you with a marvelous solution to a problem you’ve been pondering. You may be touched by the kind gesture of a friend, or be invited to a beautiful, memorable event over the weekend of May 18-19. With Jupiter strong, it’s sure to have a touch of luxury and pampering. Not invited to an event yet? Give one! It is sure to be a hit. Are you not up to giving a party? Then treat yourself to an evening at the spa.</p>
<p>If you were hoping to join a private social club or professional society, put your application in on May 17. If you have already submitted your application, you may hear back on May 18 or within two days of this date, and be excited by the news. You may go to a seminar, book signing, convention, or private party. You may attend a political rally or see a friend you’ve not seen in ages.</p>

        <p>The glamour of the month will tone down once the Sun moves to Gemini on May 20, and you may feel you’ve done plenty of socializing and are in need of some tender rest.</p>
<p>The full moon on May 23 in Sagittarius will instantly direct your attention to a work project you will either be finishing or making a decision about how you will proceed. This full moon will be influential for a plus five days. The tightest aspect this full moon makes is to financial powerhouse Pluto, so it appears you may make a generous fee, commission, bonus, advance, court settlement, bank loan, or infusion of venture capital, or receive a large, one-time payment from another source.</p>
<p>Neptune will also be outstandingly friendly to the full moon on May 23, and this suggests your creativity, style, and taste may factor into the success of the project (or did factor in if it is finishing). Neptune will also simultaneously reach out to Jupiter and Venus (both) in a very tight aspect, which could be quite romantic—so you may be planning an event for a group.</p>
<p>Venus will conjunct Jupiter on the same day as the full moon, which will amplify its graceful effect. They will meet in the last degrees of Taurus, as a final farewell to Jupiter. If you were born late in Cancer, for example July 18 to July 23, you seem to have quite a magical evening ahead. This coming together of Venus and Jupiter would be ideal for a first date or to buy something beautiful for yourself (or both!). If you are attached, make this a date night to celebrate your love—May 23 is a Thursday night, but why not meet after work? This energy will still be strong over the weekend of May 24-26, perfect for a private trip for two that’s highly romantic.</p>
<p>This month keeps on bringing headline news. On May 25, Jupiter will depart for Gemini for the first time in 12 years. Good-fortune Jupiter will then occupy a quiet place in your chart, the twelfth house, the last sector in the chart, in a long 12-year journey. You will begin your new cycle next year on June 9, 2025, when Jupiter enters Cancer. Ancient astrologers feel it is valuable to meditate about what you’d like to achieve prior to your Emerald Year when Jupiter is in Cancer.</p>

        <p>The twelfth house is a very creative place in the chart, but the caveat is that you must work alone, in solitude, to see the benefits. The twelfth house is also a place of healing, although a lot of emphasis is on psychological help by delving into the subconscious by a trained therapist. My research has shown a strong link to the healing of the physical body through surgery or other treatments when Jupiter is in this area of the chart. By all means, if you would like to feel better mentally or physically, reach out to a doctor in the coming 12 months so that you can enter your Emerald Year from June 2025 to June 2026 in the best shape ever.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>With a crowd of energetic planets in your house of friendship, a part of the chart that also covers your deepest hopes an wishes, this month could turn out to be a landmark month. You may see a dream dear to your heart realized. Friends are the key to much of your happiness, and they will touch your heart with unexpected gestures of kindness and support that you won’t see coming. You may have seen a hint of this last month near April 20 when Jupiter and Uranus, both in Taurus, conjoined. That event was a harbinger of what was to come. By May this particular gift from a loving universe will reach full flower. Rarely have you ever seen such strong outpouring of support from one or more friends as you will in May.</p>
<p>The Luckiest Day of the Year will bridge two days—May 17-18—suggesting you will have a magnificent social event on your agenda. This is one not to miss, for this event will offer a sense of pampering, luxury, breathtaking beauty, and a spirit of fun that may have been missing in your life lately. It seems the host of this event will spare not a penny to ensure that you and the other guests thoroughly enjoy the party. In the end, you will likely weave a memory spun in golden threads.</p>

        <p>In your career you have Mars at the very pinnacle of your chart—entrepreneurial Aries. This suggest that you are ready to offer higher-ups innovative ideas that would be capable of bringing in a mighty profit.</p>
<p>This is borne out by the fact that Mars is in conversation with Pluto in your financial house of commissions, bonuses, government programs, venture capital, bank loans, inheritances, or prize winnings—you have many routes to generating a bundle of cash. (If you are in a gambling mood, skip the lotto, and try for smaller contests, but I always feel that your business ideas will yield better results.) Mars is making you confident, competitive, and charismatic—you can rally many VIPs to support your cause.</p>
<p>Additionally, you may be working with global markets, perhaps the import-export of goods or services, welcoming foreign clients, or working in a foreign company within your own country, while your firm’s headquarters is based abroad. If so, you have great aspects and should find your relationship bright and encouraging. It would be an ideal month to hop a jet and visit your client or bosses at a distance.</p>
<p>Saturn is in your ninth sector, ruling foreign people and places too, so undoubtedly you are gaining experience while you expand your world view. All the life experiences that you are exposed to is likely being absorbed quite naturally and easily because Saturn, in your international house, is in Pisces, a water sign that blends easily with your water-sign Cancer Sun. It is also clear that your company supports you and will do almost anything you’ll require in order to get ahead.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you are an undergraduate or graduate school student, your professors will want to help you succeed. If you work in publishing or broadcasting, indications are good that you will progress steadily and produce a victory. This month will silence the naysayers, doubters, or critics.</p>

        <p>A legal matter started this month could be successful too, although Saturn will keep the pace slow, and Neptune will cloud certain facts that will need to be clarified and distilled before meeting the judge. Pluto is fully on your side, however, and Pluto could tip the scales of justice in your favor. If the topic is money, you will likely get the money you deserve.</p>
<p>The full moon of May 23 seems to bring a major project to fruition and with outstandingly friendly planets in spots all over your chart. The applause—and money you will earn as a result—could be thunderous. It seems to have a link to those overseas markets, and if so, VIPs will be impressed. If you are not finishing a project, you may be researching a new one and deciding which method and staff would bring the best results.</p>
<p>Romantically, at the full moon May 23, Venus will be conjunct Jupiter in Taurus, a soft, lyrical, and melodic influence that will draw you closer to the one you are with, or help you find a new love interest if you are single. As a side benefit, home -and family-related matters, which were likely a bit choppy earlier this year and causing tension, seem to have smoothed out and have now evaporated into the air.</p>
<p>Life in May is sumptuous and glorious, the best you could ever wish to see. Make the most of May, dear Cancer.</p>
