        <p>As May begins, you have an enormous emphasis on money because a bevy of planets have migrated into Taurus and into your eighth house of other people’s money. You seem bent on managing the money you have more effectively, and there are a variety of reasons this might be happening. You may get a large inheritance, or a court case involving a large sum might be settled in your favor. You may get a large gift of cash or jewelry or even win first prize in a charity raffle.</p>
<p>There are other possibilities. You might get a large commission, royalty, book advance, generous insurance payout, or a partial payment related to a one-time fee for an impending job you will do. If you have been petitioning venture capitalists, an influx of money could now come in, or if you wanted to be approved for a large mortgage, that could be approved. If you need to renegotiate your mortgage or do a second mortgage, this would be the month to do so.</p>
<p>The eighth house rules income and outgo, so you may be paying taxes or figuring out how to best pay off a loan. You may be in the process of an expensive renovation, buying or selling property, or starting a business. If you already have a business, maybe you are working out the terms of a merger, or you may be spending to create a new product you want to bring to the market. On the other hand, you may be considering purchasing valuable art or studying your financial portfolio with your advisor to find ways to increase its performance. If you are newly married, you may be busy making a legal change to your new name on your credit card.</p>
<p>You will begin to see the emphasis on money beginning May 7 at the new moon in Taurus, 18 degrees. The planets squeezed into your eighth house of other people’s money will be this new moon (opportunity), Sun (strength and favor from VIPs), Jupiter (luck and happiness), Uranus (surprise), and your ruling planet Venus (luxury, beauty, popularity, and love). The fact that your ruler is included in the group tells me you will be very focused on money.</p>

        <p>There is also strong emphasis on your spouse this month, as well as others in your life, because so many planets are occupying the third quadrant of your chart, indicating you will be doing a lot of collaborating with others. It may be that you and your spouse will decide to plan for a house or condo, either to live in or just to vacation on weekends, and will huddle with a financial planner. That would be a great idea. If you are a student in college or graduate school and need a loan or scholarship, you may be filling out financial applications that you will send in soon, and if you’ve been declined, you might send in an appeal.</p>
<p>It is also possible you’d like to get organized and do some estate planning by making a will and perhaps creating the paperwork you need with a lawyer to take care of your loved ones under any eventuality. Doing this would bring a sense of peace and serenity.</p>
<p>The eighth house also rules surgery, so if you need a procedure, this would be a good time to schedule it with your doctor and check yourself into a hospital or rehab center. Physical therapy is included in this area of the chart and so is dental work (such as taking care of a painful wisdom tooth). If you feel fine, you might provide cheer and good wishes by visiting a close friend or family member who is infirmed in a hospital or other institution associated with care and healing.</p>
<blockquote><p>This month will have brilliant, shining, diamond-like planetary power showering you with luck in your financial realm.</p></blockquote>

        <p>As you see, the new moon of May 7 will set off a financial focus and discussions of any health-related talks you need to do. This will be one of the friendly new moons of the year.</p>
<p>Jupiter has been in your financial sector for one year, and he is getting ready to leave Taurus and this area of your chart on May 25. Before he goes, these happy little planets are planning a going-away party for Jupiter.</p>
<p>The fact that Jupiter is in a financial house is a signal that the funds you will be dealing with will be generous. Uranus orbiting close to Jupiter suggests that the news of a large sum of money coming your way will appear suddenly and unexpectedly. With five planets in Taurus, you will need to remain practical, realistic, responsible, trustworthy, and steady when handing money matters for best results.</p>
<p>You may have already received a large one-time bundle of cash because, as said, as Jupiter has been in this financial eighth house for a year, since May 2023, but whether you did or didn’t get money previously, you seem in line for a large check before Jupiter says adieu later this month on May 25.</p>
<p>The Luckiest day of the Year will occur on May 18, and this is a day that deserves a gold star on your calendar. This is due to be a great day, when the Sun and Jupiter align perfectly. You will feel the energy of this spectacular day for several days before, starting from May 16 and several days after, until May 20.</p>

        <p>If you need to sign a contract, do so during the Luckiest Day of the Year period. Buy a scratch off lotto ticket if you like—but don’t spend too much. I am not sure from where your financial luck will emanate. However, if you would be lucky with a raffle ticket, you would be lucky no matter how many tickets you buy—or whatever else you do!</p>
<p>You best time to travel will be on or near May 23, which brings the full moon in Sagittarius, 3 degrees. After thinking so much about money, you may want to have a change and get in your car to drive to a sunny place. I should point out that your trip taken near the full moon could be for fun or business—either way, the trip would be successful and give you a deep feeling of satisfaction. If going to rejuvenate your spirit and to relax, choose a place with big sky and wide-open spaces. Perhaps you will opt to go camping in an open outdoor setting where you can also participate in sports.</p>
<p>Your sister, brother, or cousin may figure prominently at this full moon of May 23 (plus five days), and if so, you will soon find that this member of your family could be fortunate for you. You may travel to see each other or go into a joint venture together.</p>
<p>Here is remarkable news. Directly on the full moon, coincidentally, your ruler Venus will conjoin Jupiter on May 23, making this a standout day. Venus and Jupiter will meet in Taurus, so again, you will have the Midas touch. If you travel for business, you will likely come back with a large purchase order, victorious and humming a happy tune.</p>

        <p>Libras born September 24, and including those with birthdays that fall as early as September 22 and as late as September 28, will benefit greatly from this full moon. The same is true if you have Libra rising 0 degrees to 6 degrees or have your natal moon in Libra in that bracketed set of degrees. No matter what you do, you will be thrilled with the results of the full moon. If you have a natal planet from 0 to 6 degrees in Libra, Aquarius, Gemini, Aries, Leo, or Sagittarius, the planet that falls within those degrees will be lit up and help you.</p>
<p>On May 25 Jupiter will move into Gemini, a fellow air sign like your Libra Sun. It will be such a glorious period that it would be impossible to overstate. This will be a marvelous time so harmonious to your Sun. It will be a blessing for you. For the first time in four years you will have Jupiter in trine to you Sun, the most harmonious aspect possible.</p>
<p>Navigating life will become so much easier, and you will be able to capture so many of your heartfelt aims. Love, romance, and more affection, long-distance travel, legal matters, work with (or in) the media, higher education, and more will glow brilliantly for you. In the meantime, before Jupiter gets to Gemini, use the fabulous financial aspects in play this month until May 25. This month is raining diamonds!</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Living on a budget can feel restrictive and limiting, and you may be tired of it. This month, with brilliant, shining, diamond-like planetary power showering you with luck in your financial realm, you may not have to work within the confines of a budget now or for the foreseeable future. In fact, you have a good chance that you will leave this month richer than when you entered it.</p>

        <p>You have some of the most fabulous financial aspects you’ve seen in recent memory, and when the money comes, it will likely come as a complete surprise. To understand what is going on, you need to know that you have two financial houses: The first is your second house, which focuses on salary, and the other is your eighth house, which focuses on other people’s money. It is this latter house, Taurus, that is lit up brighter than Times Square for you.</p>
<p>It is hard to say what the source of your financial benefits would be. Your tidy one-time hefty check could come from a charity raffle or a scratch-off lotto ticket you will win, or it could come from a large, one-time project fee. The money you receive could come suddenly as an approved grant, or the funds might represent a college financial aid package or a full scholarship.</p>
<p>A kick-starter campaign for money could lead to an unexpectedly large sum for you. You may get a large tax refund, an inheritance, or an insurance payout for a claim you sent in. It could come as a generous commission, royalty, or cash advance for your new book.</p>
<p>If you are involved in a legal case, it may be decided in your favor, or if you are in the process of a divorce, you may be pleased with the division of property that will soon be yours. You might win a lot of money on a TV game show or be given a lavish, valuable gift. As you see, there are many possible sources of the cash you seem destined to receive. When you are lucky, you are lucky—you won’t have to try too hard.</p>

        <p>You will have to be responsive, however, so watch what happens just after the new moon in Taurus on May 7. Things will start things to cook for you in the days and weeks that follow it, with the strongest energy in the week following the new moon. See what kind of the phone calls, emails, and letters you receive. If you are negotiating benefits for a new job, such as health insurance, vacation time, or the ability to work from home (perhaps in a hybrid situation), all these benefits will help you save money.</p>
<p>Mars is currently moving nicely through your partnership sector, so it may be that your partner in love (such as your spouse) or business (such as your agent, business partner, manager, publicist, or other expert) will bring you exciting financial news. If you are married, it’s very likely your spouse is doing very well these days, and you would benefit, too. Mars is in Aries, the sign of entrepreneurial activity, so the work your partner is doing or that will bring an influx of funds will likely be in a very new area.</p>
<p>By the full moon in Sagittarius on May 23, you may be ready to take a trip (within five days of this date), possibly to visit your sister, brother, or cousin, or to travel WITH your relative. If so, go to a setting with big sky, plenty of sunshine, and wide panoramic views. Jupiter will take the lead, and it looks like your trip might be spontaneous, bringing even more fun, for serendipity is the spice of life.</p>

        <p>This full moon brings the coincidental meeting of your ruler Venus and good-fortune Jupiter, making this full moon one of the best of the year for you. Both will meet in Taurus, so again, your ability to attract money could be jaw-droppingly effective. When one aspect after another shows you are fortunate with financial dealings, you certainly will notice this theme.</p>
<p>You might also get a contract to sign at the full moon, May 23, and if so, this appears to be a special one. Ask you lawyer to give the contract a look first, and when ready, sign. This will certainly be an unusually upbeat, happy month.</p>
<p>Upcoming on May 25 will be the historic move of Jupiter into Gemini, a place it has not been for 12 years. This is great news for you because Gemini is an air sign like your Libra Sun, and this move will be supremely harmonious to you. This will bring a feeling of optimism, energy, better health, and lots of lucky breaks in the coming 12 months. Magnificent opportunities will come your way in all corners of your life. Thrilling foreign travel is among the many goodies coming to you in the months ahead.</p>
