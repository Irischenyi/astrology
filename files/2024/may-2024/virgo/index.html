        <p>May should certainly will be a joyous month for you. In fact, it’s likely to be one of your very favorites of the year. As you enter the month, five heavenly bodies will be in Taurus: The Sun, new moon (on May 7), Venus, Uranus, and Jupiter. All will support your Sun in Virgo, which is quite impressive, and all are in your ninth house, an area of your chart that coaxes you to look at life broadly and panoramically.</p>
<p>Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, entered this part of your chart last year in May 2023, and Jupiter is now getting ready to say good-bye and move into Gemini this month on May 25—Jupiter takes 12 years to journey around the Sun, spending one year in each sign and each house of the horoscope. The planets in Taurus will honor Jupiter by throwing him a big blow-out festive party, chock full of sparkling aspects. It’s rare to see the planets getting along so well with each other, but that’s precisely what is happening in May.</p>
<p>The new moon of May 7 in Taurus at 18 degrees will kick off the celebration. We have ten heavenly bodies in our solar system, and half of them will be in Taurus, crowded into your ninth house of travel, for personal pleasure or for business, so May would be an ideal time to get away. You are likely to travel a great distance, possibly to a country that requires your passport. No matter where you would love to go, go now, for later, the planets won’t be as encouraging for you to travel, and I will show you why later in this report.</p>
<p>If you say you cannot travel because you have obligations to attend to near home base, you might simply be on the phone and email with people based in foreign nations. You may be handling the import and export of ideas, creativity, products, or services. You may find you are mixing and mingling with ambassadors and diplomats or other government officials. The ancients felt that travel helps broaden the mind and fosters learning about the world’s cultures in a direct way.</p>

        <p>Higher education that comes after high school is another topic that is ruled by the ninth house, a basically intellectual house, so you may have committed to go to graduate school or to finish your undergraduate degree. You may be visiting different institutions to choose your favorites to send in an application, or you may be taking final exams in May and looking forward to graduation.</p>
<p>Sharing information is also part of the ninth house, and that comes through publishing and broadcasting. Virgo is ruled by Mercury, the communicator planet, the reason you are known to be talented in the communication arts, such as writing, public speaking, editing, researching, translating, copy editing, coding, game creation, and so much more. Watch what happens near the new moon May 7.</p>
<p>New moons bring something new, so you will get a new assignment soon. If you work in the courts, you may have an important new case on the agenda or be busy preparing opening statements. If you are not a lawyer, you may be bringing a case to court quite successfully. The process of learning and sharing information also rules debate, the hallmark of the court system and the reason the courts are part of the ninth house.</p>

        <p>You may be working on a new book, screenplay, or documentary, writing and managing social media, or be given an advertising or publicity campaign. You may be writing poetry or lyrics for a series of songs. Or you may be writing contracts or corporate annual reports. There are so many possibilities.</p>
<p>If your birthday falls on September 11 or 12, plus or minus five days, you will benefit in a big way from the May 7 new moon in Taurus. The same is true if you have your natal moon at 18 degrees or your rising sign at 18 degrees, plus or minus five degree, in Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn, Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces.</p>
<p>Any of the activities I named would get a big boost on a day that comes later, May 18, the Luckiest Day of the Year. This is the once-a-year event when the Sun aligns with benefic Jupiter, always on a different day and in a different zodiac sign, or place, in the chart. This year is special because so many planets are in earth signs, and Jupiter and the Sun will meet in Taurus (and earth sign) for the first time in 12 years.</p>
<p>If you can take a spontaneous trip in May to an international location, I urge you to go. I especially want you to consider leaving over the weekend of May 18-19, and if you have vacation time coming to you, take a few extra days. Going just over the border to a country, for example, in the US, going to Canada or Mexico, could count as a foreign trip. (Here in the US, we look at our bordering countries as our friendly neighbors, not as “foreign,” but we still need a passport to get in, so they would technically be classified as a foreign trip.)</p>

        <p>If your birthday falls on September 21, plus or minus four days, you will get a double dip of pleasure from the alignment of the Sun and Jupiter on the Luckiest Day of the year. If your natal moon or your rising sign is at 28 degrees of Taurus, Virgo, or Capricorn, plus or minus five degrees, you will also benefit in a big way.</p>
<p>Next, I want to direct your attention to the full moon of May 23 in Sagittarius, 3 degrees, when something is coming to a pinnacle regarding your home, other property you may be ready to rent or buy, or a family member. If you are renovating, you will either make the big move out of your house as the team that the contractor hires arrives, or alternatively, you may see the work finished at this full moon. If you are renting (or buying) a vacation home, you might conclude the paperwork at this time.</p>
<p>Neptune will be beautifully oriented toward this full moon, suggesting any new furniture, artwork, or rugs along with the colors or tones of paint or design of wallpaper you’d select, would not simply change the décor but add a good deal of beauty of your home. Neptune is the planet ruling artistic endeavors and is capable of providing quite an enchanting environment. Pluto will be in fine agreement with the Sun and full moon, so while all the focus will be on your home near May 23, you will also have projects to do at work, and that means money will be coming in.</p>
<p>Mars will be in your eighth house all month, which suggests you will be spending quite a lot of money this month, and that will continue through June 8. Mars will make you more aggressive about finding new sources of income too, and to cut waste and find bargains.</p>

        <p>If you are using this full moon to help a family member who needs your attention or financial help, you will make a decision and have a plan ready on or close to May 23.</p>
<p>Something else is happening at the same time of the full moon, yet separately from the full moon. On May 23, love-me Venus and pampering Jupiter will align perfectly. This is a beautiful, loving aspect that happens once a year always on a different day and in a different sign. Venus and Jupiter are meeting at 29 degrees, the last degree, in Taurus.</p>
<p>Due to the embrace of Jupiter and Venus, May 23 will be THE most romantic day of the month—and one of the best of the year. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I will again suggest you travel! Make it romantic! Be sure May 23 forms part of your time away. As May 23 is a Thursday, perhaps you can stay through the entire weekend. If you cannot travel, do something luxurious, such as have a splurge dinner at a special occasion restaurant or a soothing treatment at the spa.</p>
<p>Now for MORE big news of this gorgeous month. On May 25, Jupiter will make his monumental move to Gemini and into your solar tenth house of career honors, awards, and achievement. This will be Jupiter’s first visit in 12 years to your prestigious tenth house of profession. You will have an entire year with Jupiter in this area of your chart, and all the work you have done over the past decade will be recognized and rewarded now. Jupiter brings enormous luck and the means to take advantage of your good fortune. Jupiter also brings growth and reward and asks for nothing in return. His only mission is to make you happy.</p>
<p>Next month a new moon will appear in Gemini on June 6, and the planets will be having another party, with five of them (wow!) in Gemini. This time the party won’t be a farewell party (as was the case when Jupiter was leaving Taurus) but to welcome him to his new home in Gemini.</p>

        <p>When Jupiter trines Pluto on June 2, this will be a day of great prosperity and a signature of success. This day deserves a huge gold star on your calendar. Something may bubble up in your career and bring you good money.</p>
<p>Your professional future is golden, dear Virgo, and between now and next year when Jupiter will leave Gemini in early June 2025, if you concentrate on your career, you can be at the top of your game and in the process make quite a name for yourself. You will be given many opportunities and choices, for you will soon find you are prized in the marketplace. You will come to understand and appreciate your talents in a new way.</p>
<p>The projects you start from May 25, 2024, to June 9, 2025, can continue to pay you dividends for 10 years or more, possibly forever. You will need to choose the offers that come to you carefully. Choose the ones you love and that feed your soul while at the same time have the potential for growth and long-term gain.</p>
<p>Planets on the north, south, east, and west angles of the chart act in a very strong way—like stallions—for those points define direction and are similar to the way a compass would provide direction for you.</p>
<p>This is good news for you will have Jupiter, planet of growth and happiness, on one of those points, acting in a super-powerful way the entire time Jupiter resides in Gemini. Your career will be on fire, dear Virgo, and that is why I am urging you to go on a trip early in May when all the barriers to go are falling away. And with Jupiter in Taurus, the experience would be quite luxurious. Later, when your career heats up, you will be too busy to go. You are on the threshold of tremendous professional growth, and it all will be quite exciting when you see your role in the marketplace transformed.</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You have a glorious month ahead, for it is one of the best of the year. Planets are on the move and stacking up in Taurus, a fellow earth sign, which means each can support you in a big way. As a Virgo, you look to find a practical application for all you do, and that natural tendency in you will make you a standout this month.</p>
<p>You have Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck; Uranus, the planet of sudden and unpredictable news or change; the Sun, the place you will shine; and Venus, the ruler of the house they are squeezed into, all in your intellectual ninth house of Taurus. Each of these planets is awaiting the new moon, May 7, also in Taurus, which will create a vortex in which all these planets (and some of the other planets elsewhere in your chart) will join to create opportunities for you.</p>
<p>This extraordinary buildup of planetary energy will offer you a chance to travel internationally or, at the very least, to work with individuals at a great distance from you, most likely in a foreign country. You may work with those international VIPs in person, on the phone, by email, or over Zoom. You may be writing or editing for an international publication or working as a producer on a TV show to export to or import from foreign shores.</p>
<p>Alternatively, considering your kind Virgo soul, you may be working to bring food and supplies to those in foreign countries who are suffering. Other Virgos will be studying as an undergraduate or graduate student, possibly abroad. If you were awarded a research grant, you may go overseas in order to complete the program.</p>

        <p>With the new moon so close to Uranus, news and opportunity will come up suddenly and without any notice. You will need to be decisive to quickly clutch the chance being offered, lest someone else grabs the offer before you do.</p>
<p>If you plan to do anything of vital importance for your future, choose to enact it on one of two days, May 17 or May 18, the Luckiest Days of the Year, when Jupiter and the Sun will align in favorable Taurus in your in your ninth house, the same international house where so much excitement will be taking place.</p>
<p>You may be working with your romantic or business partner, and this person will be a stabilizing force and may want to travel with you. Mars is in your financial sector, which often forces up expenses. Luckily, however, Mars will be in sync with Pluto in your work-a-day projects sector, suggesting business will be excellent for you and will help you generate a steady flow of income. You seem to be easily covering monthly bills and will have money left over to save or spend as you please.</p>
<p>Mercury, your ruler, is in entrepreneurial Aries this month (and no longer retrograde as it was in April), so you will be keeping a careful eye on costs at home and at work, in the latter case on budgets for clients. You may have an original product or idea to introduce to the marketplace, and this month would be an ideal time to do so.</p>

        <p>You will be distracted by events or news emanating from your home, other property you might rent or own or want to buy or sell, or regarding a family member at the full moon May 23. You may be signing for a rental, buying a vacation home, or asking the painters, contractor, or landscape artist to finish a project. You could be so happy with how things look, you’ll give a party with friends shortly after all is finished.</p>
<p>Coincidentally to this full moon on May 23, you have one of the sweetest days of the month and possibly of the year. This will happen when Jupiter will align with Venus in Taurus in your travel house—on May 23. I urge you take this opportunity to have a highly romantic long weekend away.</p>
<p>On May 25 Jupiter, the great benefic, will be heading to your career sector for a little over 12 months. This is the first time in 12 years you’ve seen Jupiter here, so, dear Virgo, the excitement and celebrations have only just begun.</p>
