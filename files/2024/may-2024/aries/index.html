        <p>May will be a beautiful month, and truly the best of the year. I keep telling friends that May is so special that it will be raining diamonds! That image exactly fits your chart, dear Aries. No matter what your financial situation happens to be, I see opportunity for your earned income to rise faster than a geyser suddenly shooting skyward. There are other lovely developments in store for you, too.</p>
<p>Let’s start at the beginning. As you enter this month, you’ll have far more control over events than you have had in previous months. Mars, your ruler, just entered Aries on April 30. Happily, the red planet will be with you until June 8. This is a once-in-two-year competitive advantage, lasting approximately six weeks, that will put you ahead of the parade in virtually every area of your life.</p>
<p>It appears you are currently working hard on an important goal, one that is dear to your heart and that will go to the very core of your identity. You will be able to command attention—influential people will support you, for they will be impressed with your courage, leadership style, confidence, energy, and entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
<p>Last month Mercury was retrograde and held you back from progressing forward as quickly as you would have liked. In fact, you may have felt in limbo, but that was then, and this is now. Mercury went direct April 25, and by May 13, Mercury will be moving extremely fast. Each day you will see greater progress.</p>

        <p>You won’t have to wait long for your spectacular aspects to arrive. On Friday, May 3, your ruler, Mars, already in Aries, will send a shimmering beam to powerhouse Pluto. This is a super strong, very positive aspect. You will be feeling on top of your game, like you are able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. You will be fueled by both passion and endurance, transforming yourself from the inside out. It will be clear that nothing will stop your forward momentum.</p>
<p>On Monday, May 6, the Sun and Saturn will be in perfect sync, so anything you do on this day will have long-range positive implications. It’s a great day to sign a contact if you hope to see a solid profits and have a long-term association.</p>
<p>Your even bigger day will arrive at the new moon in Taurus, 18 degrees, on Tuesday, May 7, which is about to brilliantly light your second house of earned income. Wow! You will have the Sun (giver of strength and life) and his partner, the gracious new moon (opportunity), along with Venus (beauty, fun, luxury), Uranus (surprises), and Jupiter (good fortune) all in your financial sector gearing up to assist you to make more money.</p>

        <p>You are in a period of enormous financial reward—but to see it, you must ask for your due. Mars in Aries will give you the courage to speak up. Whatever level of salary you negotiate now will be in place for a long time. (You will be able to get small raises later, of course, but nothing like what is going on now.) This is your chance to make a quantum leap upwards. Jupiter will leave Taurus later this month on May 25, and hence, you will need to wait 12 years to have the spectacular help from Jupiter in this house, as you have now.</p>
<p>Your window to move forward and to name your price will be perfect in the days that follow this new moon, May 7. All new moons are influential for more than just a day. They are strongest in the first week after they appear, and will very gradually decline in power—this new moon’s influence in Taurus will continue until the full moon in Taurus on November 15.</p>
<p>It’s the impending departure of Jupiter from Taurus on May 25 this month, along with a perfect new moon, that makes me urge you to act now. There is not a minute to spare. If you are self-employed, you can gently raise your fees for your goods or services. Aries is the only sign with this fantastic financial situation.</p>
<p>I need to show you the way the planets are cooperating with one another. This new moon in Taurus, 18 degree, is conjunct Uranus, so it will bring surprise news. If Uranus were alone, things could go either way, but the new moon and Uranus are both conjunct good-fortune Jupiter, and this will be the only time this will happen this year. The next time Jupiter and Uranus meet they won’t be in your financial house, plus their next meeting won’t take place until 2037—13 years from now.</p>

        <p>In addition to the glowing new moon conjunct Uranus and Jupiter, you have one more planet added to this tight little group—Venus! The other planets are all within 18 to 22 degrees, with Venus earlier, at 9 degrees. Aspects at the time a new moon give us clues of the outcome. At the time of this new moon, although Venus is a little far from heavy-duty Uranus and Jupiter, she will be in the perfect position to be “sextile” (wide) Saturn, an aspect of great opportunity and growth. Saturn will see that you feel a greater sense of financial security and stability. Moreover, Venus is taking the lead at this new moon (Venus rules Taurus), so this is a remarkable coincidence that Venus is in such good aspect to Saturn.</p>
<p>There is more to see! We have the Luckiest Day of the Year due on Saturday, May 18, a golden day, and you will start to feel its warmth on May 17 as the energy of three planets and the Sun grow toward conjunction. On these Luckiest Days, you will have the Sun, Uranus, Jupiter, and Venus crowded together on the head of a pin with their degrees ranging from 23 to 28 degrees. This is extraordinary. What a wonderful set of days.</p>
<p>Uranus takes 84 years to circle the Sun, and Jupiter take 12 years. When you have planets this slow-moving, you will definitely feel their goodness as they grow toward conjunction in the days before they meet. In other words, you will feel the glow for days leading up to May 18. Remarkably on the same day, May 18, Venus will meet with Jupiter in the same sign Venus rules—Taurus. You just can’t make this up. Again, Venus, which has financial shading of her own, and all these planets are associated with money, gifts, and all kinds of financial rewards for you</p>
<p>How should you use the Luckiest Day of the Year? Do something you are a little afraid to do—a day you need a lucky edge to allow you to capture what you are setting out to grasp. For you, Aries, it’s all about money. Not only might you earn more money, but you may find ways to stretch your money further through buying at lower prices, finding a bargain, or by cutting out waste. You might negotiate a deal quite skillfully this month, too. This month’s aspects are not about winning money, but earning it—and managing it wisely. I will admit you might receive a generous belated birthday gift of cash or jewelry, too</p>

        <p>Now let’s turn to Mother’s Day, which, for my American readers, will be on May 12. The transiting moon will be in Cancer, the perfect place to be on this day, for Cancer rules the love of home and family. The transiting moon in Cancer will be in ideal agreement to Venus in Taurus, so honor your mother with flowers, perfume, a gorgeous white, luminous silk blouse, or a soothing treatment at the spa. And a luxurious brunch for your mother would be the crowning jewel.</p>
<p>The following day, Monday, May 13, will bring spectacular aspects, too. The Sun will conjoin Uranus, as the surprise, cosmic party in the sky continues. This month just keeps on coming.</p>
<p>As said earlier, on May 25 Jupiter will pack his bags and leave Taurus for Gemini, a sign where he will reside for a full year. In Gemini, Jupiter will help you sharpen your communication skills and also help you travel more than you have in the past year. Your focus won’t be on money from that point on, but instead, you will start to have grand experiences in the realm of communication and travel, which I will outline here.</p>
<p>You may write and publish a very popular book or screenplay. You may place a blockbuster app or digital game on the market or design (or redesign) your website or that of a client, with stunning results—it could even win an award. With A.I. coming faster than a freight train to the world, you may decide to get on that train and learn all you can as you go.</p>

        <p>You may find your sister or brother to be very fortunate for you, too, in the coming year because the third house, where Jupiter will make his new home in your chart, rules siblings. You may get an introduction, a tip, or recommendation from your sister or brother, or you may go into a venture together, such as to buy a piece of property or start a business together. Alternatively, you may simply decide to plan a great vacation together. You have many possibilities.</p>
<p>Coming back to the idea of travel, two days earlier, on Thursday, May 23, you will have a full moon in Sagittarius, 3 degrees, so at that time, you may find yourself in a distant city. You may have to go for work, or you may simply take a fast trip to a romantic city like Paris for four dazzling days. Either way, you will love your time away.</p>
<p>You will likely love your trip because of the tightest aspect from Pluto that will be in place at this full moon—Pluto in Aquarius is currently based in your eleventh house, suggesting that a friend would either come with you, or you may visit a friend at your destination. Being with this particular friend will make the trip so special.</p>
<p>Pluto will send a beam to Venus and the Sun, suggesting a way to make good money. (This month has money written all over it for you.) There is some sort of connection between financial gain and this full moon May 23. Things come to a conclusion at full moons, and this one will bring not only luck with travel but also opportunity in the publishing and broadcasting industries, legal matters, and competitive luck in the process of getting an advanced degree or grant from a college or university. All these areas shine for you, dear Aries.</p>

        <p>Keeping our focus on the May 23 full moon in Sagittarius, this full moon is fantastic and practically flawless. One of the areas that I just listed above will come to a finish within five days of May 23. A successful friend or someone in a club you belong to will be instrumental in your ability to do well with financial matters in this, the third week of May.</p>
<p>Let’s look ahead one month, to June. If you are interviewing for a new position, I feel you will either hear word, or actually start your new job, on or near the full moon in Capricorn next month on June 21. That is a Friday, so pieces of your puzzle could fall into place on Thursday June 20, or Monday, June 24. You will likely be thrilled to hear that your new employer will meet your salary requirements. By next month, that full moon of June 21 will highlight your professional contributions to your firm, your industry, your community, or to the world at large.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>No matter what you expect will happen in this month of May, it will surprise you by being even better. This will be a hugely important financial month for you, and it looks as though you can finish this month considerably richer than when you entered it.</p>
<p>The new moon in Taurus on May 7 will be an important one for you because it will trigger your financial success. You may get a generous raise, an offer for a new job, or, if you are self-employed, customers or clients will burst through your door, eager to get your goods or services—you may have to hire help to keep up with the demand.</p>

        <p>If you need to sign a contract this month, do so on or very close to on the Luckiest Day of the Year, when the Sun and Jupiter join forces to rain down profits, May 18.</p>
<p>Adding to this glowing month, Mars, your guardian planet, will spend the entire month in Aries, a privilege you had to wait two years to enjoy. Mars will leave Aries June 8, but in the meantime, you have weeks of what everyone wants—supreme control over events. Mars will teach you to stand out like the star that you are and to compete extremely well in any arena. You will be your best, energetic, confident, courageous self. Even in matters of love, you will emit a lovely charisma that will be irresistible.</p>
<p>Travel may be on the agenda at the full moon, May 23, for the moon will be in the jet-set sign of Sagittarius, which is a friendly fire sign to your Aries Sun sign. With good money flowing in, it looks like you’ll feel flush and will be able to afford take an exciting trip. If you have small children or family obligations, you may choose to use the energy of this sweet full moon a different way. You may conclude an international business deal because Venus will conjoin Jupiter in Jupiter’s last days of Taurus in this decade, which is another sure sign that you are quite a money magnet in May. You seem to be celebrating a career triumph and enjoying the fruits of success.</p>
<p>Another way money may find a way to your bank account is if you decide to you sell property, jewelry, furniture, or something else, or you may be given news that a court settlement has gone in your favor. The broadcasting and publishing industries will shine for you, as well as any actions you take toward getting a degree in an institution of higher education. Something important to you is coming to a conclusion or a final answer, and you should be thrilled when you go through this period.</p>

        <p>Another monumental event will happen this month—May 25—when Jupiter moves to Gemini, to stay a year, and this is the first time in more than a decade you’ll have hosted Jupiter in your communication sector. Gemini is an air sign that will support your fire-sign element. You will get to leave home to go on trips much more often in the coming 12 months and open up to new places and people that are situated within 200 miles of where you live.</p>
<p>Gemini is the sign of the scribe, so if you are interested in improving your writing or speaking talents—no matter what type of communication you would like to improve—Jupiter in Gemini will see that you get the training, experience, and opportunities that you crave to display your skills.</p>
<p>You might want to take classes for creative writing, advertising, public speaking, coding, game or app development, or web design. If you do sign up for a course, you would see enormous progress in the coming year. Start immediately, and you will be charging a handsome price for your burgeoning talents before long.</p>
<p>As another bonus, Jupiter in Gemini portends luck from a brother, sister, or cousin in the coming year, in all of its various possible manifestations.</p>
