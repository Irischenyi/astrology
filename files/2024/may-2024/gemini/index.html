        <p>This will become a landmark month for you, but as you ease into May, you won’t see changes until you get close to the end of the month. It’s a good, solid month, and one that will benefit you, even during the quieter parts. Now let’s look to see what is going on in the heavens.</p>
<p>Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, is currently packing his bags and preparing to say goodbye to Taurus. A crowd of little planets is coming together to throw Jupiter a going-away party. All the festivities begin with the new moon in Taurus on May 7. In addition to the new moon and her partner the Sun, the giver of all life and strength, Venus, Uranus, and the star of the celebration, Jupiter, will be in attendance. All of these planets will be in a quiet place in your chart—Taurus, your twelfth house.</p>
<p>It appears that discussions will be held by others—people you know, and those you don’t—but whose decisions will eventually affect you very much. For now, you seem to be unaware of precisely what is going on, but you will know soon. When you look at this buildup of planets in such a private, behind-the-scenes part of your chart, you may wonder if this cluster of energy is a good or foreboding sign of what’s to come. I feel you have nothing to worry about because these planets are extraordinarily friendly.</p>
<p>As this month begins, Jupiter, the planet of good fortune, is still orbiting within 3 degrees of Uranus, the planet of surprise. This aspect denotes happiness, optimism, and joy. Every once in a while the universe sends us a bouquet to keep us motivated and excited about life. Jupiter rules your committed relationships (bound by contract) in marriage and business.</p>

        <p>If you are searching for an expert to collaborate with you in any realm of your business or personal life, you may have had unusual problems finding the right person last month, or if you are married, you may have felt you and your spouse were traveling on different tracks, and their ideas were not interesting.</p>
<p>Mercury was retrograde throughout last month, and that did not help the matter, but fortunately, Mercury went direct on April 25. Mercury takes some time to return to full speed—that will happen by May 13, but each day will find Mercury in better and stronger shape in every way.</p>
<p>It’s also clear that you will be working in a strategic planning mode this month. Once the Sun enters Gemini on May 20, this will mark the start of the other planets’ mass migration into your sign. Venus will be next to enter Gemini on May 23. Jupiter will enter your sign for the first time in 12 years on May 25, to stay until June 9, 2025. Your ruler Mercury, feeling a little groggy after his long sleep in retrograde, will catch up to this cluster of partying planets in Gemini on June 3. As you see, each day you will receive more information and feel more in control.</p>
<blockquote><p>You are entering your Emerald Year. The coming 12 months will be filled with activity, travel, and many offers to fulfill some of your greatest desires.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Some of the planets are too far away to join the party in Taurus, which is taking place in early May. For example, Saturn, busy with his own assignment in Pisces, your prestigious career sector (tenth house), will send friendly greetings to the new moon, the Sun, Uranus, and Jupiter. This will give weight and importance to the project or question you are working on. You can come up with a long-term solution, so keep looking until you hit on it.</p>
<p>The Luckiest Day of the Year occurs on May 18 but will be felt for plus or minus two days. Again, this falls in Taurus, because at this point in the month, the going-away party for Jupiter will still be in full swing. The Sun and Jupiter will be in your twelfth house, so a high-level person will be saying wonderful things about you, but this conversation will be unknown to you. This will be a protective influence, and you may eventually find out who your behind-the-scenes benefactor is, but not yet. Your guardian angel won’t be a fuzzy blue angel out of a Disney movie but a real, flesh-and-blood person who will go out of their way for you.</p>
<p>Use the Luckiest Day of the Year to do something that’s difficult to accomplish—that you would need an extra bit of luck to thread things through to success. This would be a great day to sign a contract or agree to a collaboration with another professional. You will likely be doing something confidential that you are not ready to show others until you are finished with your project or have completed your goal.</p>
<p>You had a similar (but not identical) Luckiest Day of the Year on May 8, 2000, 24 years ago. Does that date ring a bell? If you have been alive long enough, do you recall what you were doing around then? You had a lot of difficult planets surrounding the Luckiest Day of the Year back then, and that stole a lot of its thunder. This year, on and near May 18, you have all positive aspects.</p>

        <p>You had another similar Luckiest Day of the Year on May 13, 2012. Maybe you could look through your photographs or emails to see what you were doing at that time. This one had a subtle influence. You may have been working on a thesis, grant, or manuscript you would publish as a book. Your twelfth house is a house of secrets and also an area that emphasizes working alone in solitude where you would create a work of great creativity and artistry. That possibility holds for you this year, too. You always need to partner with the universe by taking action to see the greatest results.</p>
<p>Finally, your twelfth house is also a house of healing. If you need surgery, important dental work, a medical procedure, or physical therapy, schedule it for the Luckiest Day of the Year, plus or minus two days, if you can.</p>
<p>Everything will start to go better after May 20 when the Sun moves into Gemini. This is when many of the darling little planets will begin their migration into your sign. You will feel more energetic and optimistic, and you will see the tempo of your life speed up.</p>
<p>Venus will enter Gemini on May 23, which is always marvelous—Venus brings fun, love, parties, and much more social activity. Venus can also amp up your charisma.</p>
<p>May 25 will be the biggest event of the month, of the year, and of the decade for you. It is the date good-fortune Jupiter enters Gemini, and you will be wearing the crown of the Celestial Favorite. You are entering your Emerald Year, and you will be presented with a plethora of opportunities. Take the ones that have the largest, long-term potential, both in your personal and professional life. If the past 12 months have been a little too quiet for your taste, the coming 12 months will be just the opposite—they will be filled with activity, travel, and many offers to fulfill some of your greatest desires. Jupiter will be in Gemini from May 25, 2024, to June 9, 2025. You’ve waited 12 years to have Jupiter’s assistance, and you are looking at a year of opportunity in just about every nook and cranny of your life. You will meet many new people, and among the friendships you make may be one person who stands out as a possible romantic interest. You will travel more often, very possibly to a country or region that you have never seen that will require your passport. Your career will receive a boost, and the seeds you plant this year will bring harvests in mid-2025 to mid-2026. Jupiter will also work to improve your health. You truly have an amazing outlook, dear Gemini.</p>

        <p>Let’s step back two days to the full moon in Sagittarius on May 23. This full moon falls in your committed partnership/marriage house, so you may be promising your love or teaming with a person in a business relationship for a goal that would benefit both of you.</p>
<p>Venus will conjoin Jupiter, a gorgeous aspect, and this will bring a fun invitation, romance, or the purchase of something beautiful (and perhaps a little pricier than you’d wanted to spend). If you are not invited to a party, you could book yourself into a spa or have dinner in a gorgeous restaurant with someone who means a great deal to you. I feel you will like what happens during this lovely full moon.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>For a long time, you’ve worked in earnest, but you may have been frustrated lately because you’ve been wondering why you haven’t yet seen the kind of results that you’d expected by now—results that would be commensurate with your mighty effort. In both your public and private life you’ve been doing everything right, but things seem not to have clicked into place. Not yet—but you are very close to experiencing a breakthrough.</p>
<p>On May 25 Jupiter, the planet of good fortune, will enter Gemini for the first time in 12 years, and he will remain in Gemini for an entire year, until June 9, 2025. During this time, with you as the celestial favorite, Jupiter will shower you with rewards and opportunities. As you enter May, you will still have no idea that Jupiter is on the way to you and that you are on the verge of such an extraordinary year ahead.</p>

        <p>For now, let’s go back to the start of May to see what’s going on. Saturn is currently in your professional sector (tenth house), and as the boot camp sergeant of the zodiac, Saturn cares very much about honing your career skills and seeing you advance. Admittedly, Saturn has a strange way of showing he cares about you, but he does. He can be a stern, demanding teacher. Saturn first entered Pisces, your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement, last year in March 2023 and is due to remain there until February 2026.</p>
<p>Hosting Saturn in your most prestigious professional sector is not easy—your tenth house places you in the public eye. It is also one of the areas of the zodiac that is “on the angles” of your chart—these include the first house (your personality and vitality), fourth house (home and family), seventh house (marriage and partnerships), and tenth house (professional advancement, leadership, and reputation), so the pressure to perform is on you, but you are up to the task.</p>
<p>Planets in these houses have an extra-strong effect, acting like wild stallions. You have two powerful planets on the angles: Jupiter in Gemini, your solar first house of identity (starting soon on May 25), and Saturn in Pisces, your solar tenth house of career success. If you feel under pressure, you are not dreaming. If you can meet the challenges of Saturn, however, breakthroughs will materialize for you as promised by Jupiter.</p>
<p>If you apply yourself to Saturn’s demands, you will be in an entirely new place in your career when you finish Saturn’s tour in mid-February 2026. It won’t be all career glory but with little compensation either—you will likely see quite an upgrade in salary at that time thanks to Jupiter’s position, by then in Cancer.</p>

        <p>Mars had been circulating in this same prestigious tenth house of advancement and honors from March 22 to April 30, and during that time, you likely made significant headway, promoting your accomplishments and gaining the ear of high-level people. That was the first time in two years that Mars had been in this area of your chart, and if there was anyone you needed to see to make a good impression professionally (such as during a job interview or a pitch to bring in a new client), you would likely have had good success then.</p>
<p>Planets are gathering in Taurus, your twelfth house, this month—Venus, Uranus, Jupiter, and the Sun—and setting things into action will be the arrival of the new moon in Taurus on May 7. It appears that high-level people have noticed your efforts and are impressed. Your name is coming up in behind-the-scenes meetings, and it looks like a VIP has plans to tap your talents for an upcoming project.</p>
<p>The Luckiest Day of the Year will be when the mighty Sun and good-fortune Jupiter meet in conjunction on May 18 in this very same area of your chart. You may hear about what is happening behind the scenes by May 20, or news that’s being hatched now might come out in several weeks. Rest assured that others are championing your cause, and you will know the full story soon.</p>

        <p>You may be taking on a partner at work or in your personal life near the fabulously friendly full moon on May 23 in Sagittarius. Professionally, one example of joining forces with another person might be that you start collaborating with a writing partner or, if you are self-employed, an agent, publicist, or a new client to produce a mutually beneficial cross-promotion.</p>
<p>In love, you might get engaged or married, and if you are already wed, your partner may have exciting news to share.</p>
<p>This is a dazzling month for you, dear Gemini.</p>
