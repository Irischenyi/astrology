        <p>This month you will collaborate a lot. Scorpio tends to be a loner sign, so you generally like to accomplish as much as possible by yourself. However, even you realize that you can’t do everything alone and that there is value in joining forces with others. In May, with many planets gathering in your opposite sign of Taurus, you might feel a lack of control, but while you may not get all the points exactly the way you’d want, you can enlist other people to help advise you and work with you to achieve even better results.</p>
<p>This emphasis on teaming up with others will become evident by May 7 when the new moon will appear at 18 degrees Taurus. All at once, you will have this new moon (opportunity), the Sun (favor from authority), Venus (love, luxury, and fun), Uranus (surprise), and Jupiter (financial luck, expansion, and happiness) crowded into your house of committed partnerships. This is a house of fulfilled promises, usually sealed by a contract. Astrologers call this the house of marriage and partnerships, including one-to-one, confidential business relationships that you would typically have with an agent, publicist, bookkeeper, accountant, lawyer, recruiter, doctor or therapist, and other professionals you might hire for mutual benefit.</p>
<p>Jupiter is still traveling with Uranus in Taurus after they came together last month on April 20, and you may have received a clue of what was to come in May on that day. Both Jupiter and Uranus are extremely slow-moving planets, and while their conjunction peaked on April 20, they remain close, within 5 degrees, so they will still be very helpful to you during the May 7 new moon. Having the planet of good luck (Jupiter) traveling with the planet of surprise (Uranus) is a great situation for you, and they are both in your house of partnerships. When you find the right person, it will happen suddenly.</p>
<p>Saturn will be beautifully oriented to the May 7 new moon, the Sun, and Venus, and Venus is the planet that will take predominance at this new moon—wow, that’s great. This indicates that your decisions made after this new moon will have longevity and give you a comforting sense of security. This is also possible in reverse—your marriage or business partner will be a gem this month and bring you plenty of wonderful news.</p>

        <p>Mercury was retrograde last month, so you may have come close to finding a great partner to work with you, but something about that relationship might have been off and needed more attention and tweaking. Unlike April, you have blue skies and an open road in May, and you won’t experience annoying delays, postponements, and miscommunications. If last month you felt you were walking through glue, with each step feeling like an effort, join the club—everyone felt that way, with little progress. This month will move at a faster clip.</p>
<p>Last year on May 16, 2023, when the great benefic Jupiter entered Taurus, your seventh house, you were the sign most likely to become engaged or wed during Jupiter’s 12-month transit. If you are dating seriously now, there may be no more reason to wait—you have all the perfect conditions for a commitment. If you are dating but not yet ready for marriage, you might decide to be exclusive to each other and also go the next step by living together to see how it feels.</p>
<p>There’s also a different way to use this energy—if you run your own business, you may now meet a partner, such as the perfect bookkeeper or accountant, to help you. One-on-one, confidential relationships (as I mentioned earlier) are magical for you. If you are a writer or actor, for example, focus on finding the ideal agent. If you are a working mother or father, you may be searching for the right nanny for your small children. If you are planning a wedding, you can encounter a wedding planner who shares your vision. If you are about to compose a screenplay, you might want to consider collaborating closely with a writing partner.</p>
<blockquote><p>Your marriage or business partner will be a gem this month and bring you plenty of wonderful news.</p></blockquote>

        <p>This month you will be able to find the perfect partner for you, and that is not usually the case. Most often it’s a process of trial and error, but not in May—you can locate this person quickly, possibly right out of the gate. With such a strong emphasis on collaboration and joining forces this month, don’t miss your chance to seek out the right professional for you.</p>
<p>The Luckiest Day of the Year is on May 18, and you may be getting engaged or wed or ready to name the person you would like to hire to work with you. The Sun and Jupiter will be conjunct on this date—an enchanting aspect that happens each year on a different day, and the Luckiest Day has an area of influence of two days before and two days after it appears. You can use May 18 to sign with an expert who you would like to hire to help you.</p>
<p>On this same day, May 18, Venus will be conjunct Uranus in Taurus—quite an electric aspect.</p>
<p>If you are single, you might have an instant chemistry with someone special. This would be a person you would describe as marriage material, and you may be smitten. Give it time, and go slowly. See how this plays out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile at work, it’s clear you have quite a bit to accomplish. You will not be able to take a vacation until after Mars leaves Aries on June 8. For now, Mars is energetically racing through your work-a-day assignment sector (sixth house), and this suggests that you will have a lot of details to watch over. Mars and Pluto will be working together as a team during the first half of the month, and this will make you a wizard at the office, concentrating well and covering all you have to do with confidence and speed.</p>

        <p>The full moon on May 23 in Sagittarius, 3 degrees, will have you focused on money and possibly angling for a raise at your present job or negotiating your future salary with a new employer. You may be paying bills, and you might also buy something expensive that you’ve had your eye on for a long time.</p>
<p>This full moon will be in supreme angle to Neptune, so your taste, style, and creativity will be one of the central reasons someone might want to hire you. Pluto will also be helpful, suggesting you may be able to negotiate exceptional company benefits if you can’t receive as much salary as you want. Benefits like a solid health insurance policy, graduate school tuition matching, year-end bonus, flex time, or a hybrid in-office/work-from-home arrangement—you get the idea—could be valuable to you.</p>
<p>Uranus is opposed to this full moon, but it’s at a wide degree, technically just out of range of mathematical significance. This leads me to feel you will not encounter a negative surprise. Since I cannot see your individual chart from here, keep your antenna up, and listen carefully to all that is said should a surprising twist arise. I don’t think it will, but stay alert just in case.</p>
<p>There are aspects happening alongside this full moon on May 23 that will be magically romantic. On this day Venus and Jupiter will be in a once-a-year, glittering conjunction in Taurus, and both will be sextile Neptune in Pisces (an opportunity aspect), which is one of the most glamorous and enchanting aspects possible. These three planets are setting up a link between your fifth house of true love and your seventh house of forever commitment.</p>

        <p>There is more! As Venus makes her once-a-year conjunction with Jupiter on May 23, if you are married or very seriously attached, your partner will likely be very attentive and caring toward you. This would be an ideal time for just the two of you to take a long, romantic weekend away together. You cannot ask for a lovelier evening than this!</p>
<p>Can’t travel? May 23 falls on a Thursday, so book dinner for two at a romantic restaurant, or if you love to cook, whip up a dinner you know your partner would adore, complete with candlelight and roses. This full moon will amplify feelings of love, so find a way to use this highly romantic time of the month. This date has an area of influence of plus or minus one day.</p>
<p>You have headline news on May 25 when Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, leaves Taurus (your marriage/partnership sector) and enters Gemini, your eighth house of other people’s money. At this point, you will begin one of the most financially rewarding periods of your life. June will be a huge month to see how fortunate you are in matters of finance, starting with the rare aspect between Jupiter and Pluto on June 2—a hugely important aspect denoting financial success.</p>
<p>The new moon in Gemini follows on June 6, and this new moon could open the door to more money for you to fulfill a dream that’s dear to your heart. Big ambitions need funding, and it appears you may be about to receive all you need to get started.</p>
<p>You will have so much to celebrate.</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>As a Scorpio, you are intensely private, and your usual approach is to do as much as possible on your own rather than relying on other people. However, even you have to recognize the truth of this as revealed in the poem by John Donne (1572 to 1631) “No Man Is an Island” (1624), which eloquently says, in effect, we are all interconnected.</p>
<p>This month, just after the new moon on May 7, you will see the benefits of joining forces with another person due to a plethora of planets in your marriage sector that will be in friendly conversation with your fifth house of true love and children. It may be that you will do this because you are in love—you could get engaged or wed—so if you have been dating long enough to know one another well and feel ready, there will be no reason to wait.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you might join forces with a business associate, sponsor, writing partner, agent, publicist, marketing expert, lawyer, or accountant (as some examples) for a new venture. Your fifth house, that’s so important at the new moon on May 7, rules not only love and children but also your imagination and creativity. You may be working on an artistic project and need one or more partners to work with you to ensure your success.</p>
<p>Jupiter, the good fortune planet, is in your partnership sector and will be in ideal sync with this new moon—a fantastic sign that you can form a joyful association now. Or this new moon may be expressed in a personal way. Uranus is the planet of spontaneity, so you may be surprised when your sweetheart proposes to you. Venus will conjunct this new moon too, which is a symbol of happiness and ease with the person you’ve chosen.</p>

        <p>The overall, driving reason for your interest in forming a partnership, whether for love and marriage or to promote your career, is to create stability as evidenced by the position of Saturn. Saturn’s mode of operation is to create an urge to prepare you for the long road ahead and to create a firm foundation that you can build upon in the future. Saturn rarely interacts with Jupiter, but he is sending Jupiter friendly vibrations now. Saturn is in your house of love and children, and Jupiter is in your house of marriage and promises.</p>
<p>Money will be your main focus at the full moon on May 23, and you will be sending out payments for bills. Even so, you could also receive a generous influx of cash. Chances are good that you will still have enough money left over to cover any obligations. Why? Your ruler Pluto, the powerhouse planet of rejuvenation and regeneration (also considered a major financial planet), will be helpful to you.</p>
<p>Pluto has newly settled in Aquarius, your home sector, the place Pluto will spend the next 20 years, until 2044. Pluto’s position also indicates that your family adores you and could truly be a bright spot for you. If you were to run into a cash crunch, possibly because you are buying something expensive, such as a car or condo, ask a parent or older relative to see if they would manage to give you a loan—it looks like you will acquire the money you need.</p>
<p>When Jupiter moves into Gemini for a year’s stay beginning on May 25, it could be raining money, and you may want to put out buckets to catch all the dollars from heaven. You will be luckier than a leprechaun and entering into a satisfying year filled with options and opportunity. Big actions, like going to college, starting a business, buying a house, or having a baby need funding, and from the second half of 2024 up to the first half of 2025, you will be a money magnet, potentially receiving all the cash you need to make a dream come true.</p>
