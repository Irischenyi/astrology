        <p>May will bring you one of the most extraordinary months of the year. It will be packed with dazzling home -and family-related aspects that it will seem as if the universe took many of the sparkly aspects of 2024, put them in the palm of its hand, and spilled them over the night skies of May. You had an entire year to do things to make your home life happier, but don’t be sad if you didn’t take full advantage. You still have time.</p>
<p>This month the new moon and supporting planets are so supercharged that it has aspects that can help you by giving you better and fast-acting options that will help you make up for lost time. In astrology it matters when you begin, so make a first step right after the new moon appears in Taurus at 18 degrees on May 7 (more about this in a minute). That new moon will carry you forward for several additional months.</p>
<p>Ever since Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, entered your fourth house of home and family a little over a year ago in May 2023, your attention was likely directed to improving your home and, at the same time, creating a closer bond with your family. This was the area of your life where you would experience the greatest personal growth, good fortune, and inner satisfaction.</p>
<p>Jupiter will wind up his year-long visit to this domestic area of your life on May 25 when Jupiter will move to another zodiac sign and a new part of your chart. Jupiter is a slow-moving planet, so he won’t be back to this same home and family sector until April 2035, many years from now.</p>

        <p>While you will always have opportunities to improve your home, property, and family relationships from other planets, Jupiter’s presence is quite special, giving you lucky breaks and options that have not appeared in the past. Like everything else in astrology, nothing is predestined, so you had the choice either to focus on your home or on a certain family member, or let this trend pass without notice. You may feel your home is perfect as is and not in need of any additional attention.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you can think of anything you would like to improve or change, no matter how large or small, you still have time. Begin after the new moon appears on May 7 and before Jupiter is set to leave on May 25. In astrology it matters when you begin (“give birth to” an initiative) for best luck. Take a large or small step now while you are still under such scintillating aspects. Mars, the action planet, is due to come into your same home and family sector from June 8 to July 20 to carry you plans to a grand finish.</p>
<p>If you already took good advantage of the golden energy Jupiter was pouring into your home area, it is possible you still have a few goals on your list. In that case, get going this month to scoop up all the last bits of Jupiter’s golden energy, for that can bring breakthroughs you don’t expect. Here is why this month’s new moon is different from others, and which other planets will join to help you, too.</p>
<blockquote><p>To have your guardian planet Uranus orbiting shoulder-to-shoulder with good-fortune Jupiter is amazing. It does not get any better than that!</p></blockquote>

        <p>The new moon May 7 will arrive in Taurus at 18 degrees. The gracious new moon will appear with her partner the Sun along with Venus, Jupiter, and Uranus, all in Taurus. That adds up to five out of 10 heavenly bodies—half the solar system—in your home and family sector, and that is a lot of fortunate energy to help you! All the planets are surrounding Jupiter to thank him for his good fortune in home-related matters and to wish him well on his journey to Gemini on May 25.</p>
<p>Venus will conjoin the new moon, and Venus rules beauty, while the moon in the chart rules, among other things, the domestic condition. This tells me that you will love the result of your project. If you are finished with your home-related project, you may decide to entertain this month—do it over the weekend of May 18-19 for fabulous results.</p>
<p>Your parents, or those you think of as parents, come under the same fourth house area of the chart, so instead, you may have directed all your attention to helping a parent or other family member financially or with loving help.</p>
<p>Jupiter will orbit close to Uranus, as they already conjoined last month on April 20, but Mercury was retrograde and messed up the situation somewhat. You will get a second chance this month on whatever you were trying to accomplish in April as Mercury is now functional and moving direct.</p>

        <p>Slow-moving planets Jupiter and Uranus will orbit within five degrees of each other and will bring unexpected luck with home -and family-related goals, just when you need that good fortune most. Uranus is Aquarius’ ruler, so to have your guardian planet orbiting shoulder-to-shoulder with good-fortune Jupiter in your home sector is amazing. It does not get any better than that!</p>
<p>Saturn and Neptune are both in Pisces and too far away to make the cosmic party in Taurus to honor Jupiter before he leaves. However, Saturn will be in a perfect position to send warm greetings to the new moon, and that will add to your sense of security and also to help you build long-term gain or appreciation.</p>
<p>Neptune will reach out to his friends Jupiter and Uranus to send his regards. Neptune is the higher octave of Venus, taking the beauty of Venus to a higher level to any design project you might be working on. Neptune is also the planet of compassion and will make you feel deeply satisfied when you help a family member who is in stress and needs your financial help or frequent presence.</p>
<p>Not to be left out, Pluto, busy getting settled in your sign, Aquarius, will send a call to Venus when she moves to Gemini on May 23, a time when the going-away party for Jupiter will be nearing a finish. Pluto will send sparkling intense and passionate vibrations to Venus, and Venus RULES your solar fourth house of home and family. This is so good that it’s remarkable!</p>

        <p>Crystalizing this new moon will be Pluto, Saturn, Neptune, Venus, Uranus, Jupiter, the Sun, and the new moon (May 7) all supporting you with home-related goals. I don’t know if you have EVER seen this level of cosmic support—I think not!</p>
<p>There are so many examples of how you could use this brilliant new moon. You might move, close on a house, buy more property, or rent a vacation home. With Jupiter in this area of your chart, you are likely to find a large, spacious, and sunny house or apartment that would also give you a view. Jupiter expands all it touches and also gives you a feeling of luxury.</p>
<p>If you love your current living space, you might call in the painters, make repairs, get a new appliance (like a dishwasher), have rugs and upholstery steamed and cleaned, and you may declutter closets. In the past year, you may have started a major renovation, or will do so now, or you may be thinking about how way to refresh your décor with a new piece of furniture or other accoutrements.</p>
<p>If you live with a roommate, you may see one leave, or you could decide to live roommate-free, giving you more space. Alternatively, you might make a big difference now in the life of a family member who is under stress and needs assistance—this month, you will find the right options to help.</p>

        <p>If you have been living in a house or apartment that is currently under a long period of renovation, then it is likely to wind down to a finish soon after Jupiter leaves Taurus on May 25.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to the Luckiest Day of the Year, which will fall on May 18 when the mighty Sun meets Jupiter. This only happens for one day each year, but you can add two days of influence before and after May 18. How can you use this day?</p>
<p>If your home is finished, choose the weekend of May 18-19 to entertain—it would be an event everyone will love and talk about for months after. You can throw your parents a darling surprise party for no particular reason, inviting many relatives you’ve not seen in a long time.</p>
<p>You can formally hire a contractor, decorator, or architect if you are beginning your project. If you are buying a house, set the closing on or near Thursday, May 16, or Friday, May 17 (prior to Saturday May 18), or plan the closing for Monday, May 20. If you do, you will likely see your house appreciate quite a bit in value over time.</p>
<p>The full moon this month will fall on May 23 and will be in Sagittarius at 3 degrees, influential for five extra days (until May 28). This will light your house of social activity—this full moon could be divinely romantic. Pluto in Aquarius will send gorgeous beams to the Sun in your fifth house of true love and to the full moon in your eleventh house of events. This could be quite a romantic time of the month for you. Passionate, intense Pluto will be trine the Sun (a heavenly aspect), and the Sun, by this time, will be in Gemini and your truelove sector.</p>

        <p>This same eleventh house, so lit up for you on May 23 to May 28, is also the house of joy and happiness. It rules hopes and wishes, so something you have long desired might be within your grasp.</p>
<p>Simultaneously and separate to this lovely full moon, on May 23 Venus will conjoin Jupiter, also in your house of home. Venus meeting with Jupiter is an enchanting aspect that only happens once a year. This is due to be an incredibly romantic day, if you chose to use it! Since these two planets are meeting in your home sector, you might want to use this full moon weekend, still influential May 25-26.</p>
<p>As the month moves to a close, on May 25 benefic Jupiter will move to Gemini and your fifth house of true love. Jupiter will spread his good fortune in this area of your chart for a full year, until June 9, 2025. To make sure you notice this wonderful trend, the new moon in Gemini of June 6 will host a welcoming party for Jupiter, and also in attendance will be the Sun, Venus, and very importantly, Mercury, all in Gemini.</p>
<p>Mercury is the planet that RULES Gemini and your fifth house of love and romance, so it’s a good sign that Mercury is coming to the party—he will take the lead as master of ceremonies.</p>

        <p>This area also rules pregnancy, birth, and the care of children. It will be easier for you to have a baby then. If you are not ready, then be careful. Finally, the fifth house also rules your creative expressions and encourages your imagination to be stimulated. Jupiter works like plant food in this area of your life, making everything expand and grow like Jack and the Beanstalk’s beans—high in the sky.</p>
<p>You have not seen Jupiter in this part of your chart since June 2012 to June 2013, and this time you have even better planetary help. Be excited, dear Aquarius.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>For a long time, you’ve been nearly obsessed with home and family. You have had two years of difficult eclipses falling in your home and your opposite sector that rules your career. At some point you may have felt you were being uprooted and forced to make changes in one way or another. Those eclipses started in November 2021 and came by in pairs every six month. That family of eclipses finally ended on October 28, 2023.</p>
<p>To soften the effects of the eclipses, the universe summoned Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, to this same area, your fourth house of home. Jupiter first arrived last year in May 2023, and now in his final days in Taurus, is finishing up his benefic tour of duty. On May 25 Jupiter is scheduled to move to a different part of your chart.</p>

        <span class="auther-name">by Susan Miller</span>
        <p>Before that happens, you will have five glorious heavenly bodies in your home sector this month: the Sun, Venus, Jupiter, and Uranus, all in Taurus and your house of home and family. To rally them all together, you have the gracious new moon in Taurus on May 7.</p>
<p>New moons have a long reach. They open a door to new opportunities and are influential for six months. They are strongest the moment they appear (and for the first 10 days) and then very gradually weaken until they have used up all their golden rays at the full moon in the same sign six months later. This new moon’s influence will last until the full moon in Taurus on November 15.</p>
<p>Remarkably, Uranus, your modern ruler, will be in lovely sextile to Saturn, your ancient ruler. Uranus and Saturn will bring you a shining opportunity in terms of a home and family matter, which might be a goal on your list to solve. If so, you will have all the help you need to find that answer this month.</p>
<p>Saturn is currently in Pisces in your financial second house and in supportive position to the Sun and new moon in Taurus. This strongly suggests the money you are spending on your home (clearly a lot) will become a wise investment and will likely appreciate the value of your home.</p>

        <p>As said, Jupiter is in his last days of Taurus, getting ready to move to Gemini on May 25. Once Jupiter leaves Taurus, he will not be back to Taurus and your home sector until April 2035. While you will always have opportunities to improve the beauty and comfort of your home, Jupiter’s presence gives you the element of luck. No matter what home-related wishes are on your list, make them a priority and investigate how you can make at least one of them a reality now.</p>
<p>If you need to move, browse as many spaces as you can this month. If you need to renovate, call friends to recommend contractors, meet with the people whose contractor names they give you, and invite the ones you like to submit bids. If you dreamed of hiring a landscape designer to create a beautiful design for the property surrounding your house, hire the designer now. Mercury is no longer retrograde, a frustrating condition that was at play last month, and by May 13, Mercury will be back to full strength. You don’t have to wait until May 13 to begin acting, but you might notice the time after May 13 brings an easier, more encouraging environment for reaching your goals.</p>
<p>In astrology, correct timing is everything—act now and you will likely adore the results. It looks like you may have been working on your property for a while, so you may be near the finish. If so, this month could be like the burst of colorful fireworks at a grand conclusion by May 25. You will see that all the discomfort you had to endure to get to your home “just so” has been worthwhile, and at long last, you can enjoy the changes you have made.</p>
<p>If you need a perfect day to schedule the closing on your house, take any other actions, or make a big decision regarding your home or family, choose the Luckiest Day of the Year, May 18, when Jupiter will perfectly align with the Sun.</p>

        <p>If you feel your home is fine as it is, then you may be in the market to buy another piece of property, perhaps a vacation home or a multi-family house you can rent out to tenants.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may be searching for ways to help a parent or other family member. Family is covered by the fourth house of home and will be receiving the same glittering rays that your physical property will receive, and that covers property you might own or rent as well.</p>
<p>Additionally, if ever there were an ideal time to make a decision on behalf of a family member, it’s in May. This works both ways—family support for your greatest desires will be very strong.</p>
<p>It appears you’ll be able to travel this month too—not as far as to another continent—but nevertheless, short escapes possibly to get away from the disarray that inevitably comes along with home improvement, or simply to distance yourself from everyday cares and to enjoy nature’s beauty of the new season.</p>
<p>You may be concerned about the large amount of money you are spending, too. In times when you need to turn the page and start a new chapter, almost all lifestyle changes involve higher than usual spending. That can last a year or two, until you make the transition to a new life.</p>

        <p>If you hope to get a better salary at work, with Saturn in your second house of earned income during the coming two years (until February 2026), you might find that prospective employers (or even your present one) will be tight fisted. Any raise in salary you would be able to negotiate would likely be so little as to be negligible.</p>
<p>Not everyone has your Saturn difficulty, so even though your friends might be able to get a decent raise, it will be harder for you. It won’t always be this way, as this is the only time in 29 years you will host Saturn in your salary sector. Come to the negotiating table with your solid list of past accomplishments, and do the best you can.</p>
<p>Saturn will be in Pisces until February 2026 to teach you the value of sacrificing small daily gratifications in favor of saving for a big purchase, such as to buy a house, or something else that will give you lasting security.</p>
<p>The full moon May 23 will bring a fun social event that you will be looking forward to attending, possibly over the coming weekend of May 25-26. The event appears to be the ideal diversion and antidote in a packed month of activity. There is some indication that if your home is guest-ready, you may decide to throw a party for friends. Good idea—with Venus conjunct Jupiter on May 23 (influential for several days in both directions), you will have a truly divine aspect for fun and luxury—so by all means start inviting your friends.</p>

        <p>When Jupiter moves into Gemini, an air sign like yours, you will enter into a year poised to bring plenty of romance and fun. You’ve not seen a year like this in years, and none in recent memory. What is to come is truly special.</p>
<p>This same area of your chart where Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck will enter on May 25 to stay until June 9, 2025, will also bring blessings for pregnancy, birth, and the care of children. If you want a baby, this year, and particularly this month, would be the time to get serious about that goal.</p>
<p>If you are creative, Jupiter will encourage your creativity and imagination, allowing your output to be more impressive than ever. Knowing this, focus on your craft.</p>
<p>You will start to see the change in June, and the new moon June 6 will rally together several planets in Gemini to make sure you see this trend take flight. You are in for a very satisfying, joyous set of 12 months ahead.</p>
