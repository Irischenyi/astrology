        <p>It’s birthday time of the year, and all the little planets are sending greetings to you. They want to make sure you have a happy birthday year ahead. You have more control over events now than you might assume you do, as all the planets are on the eastern side of the chart, favoring you. This also suggests you do not need a middleman, agent, or anyone to get things rolling for you—you are the engine, capable of starting events.</p>
<p>Saturn entered Pisces in March 2023, and now you have Saturn conjunct the Sun, which is an exceedingly rare aspect. The last time you had Saturn in Pisces was from 1993 to 1996. Last year, 2023, Saturn focused on February-born Pisces, and this year it will be those born March 1 to 10 who will be feeling Saturn’s influence the most. The last time those Pisces were highlighted by Saturn directly was in 1995, and that could have been a year of great accomplishment. Perhaps you were not yet born, but if you were, think back and see if you can find a theme.</p>
<p>You may have done something to change your status, something that you had to be ready to do and showed that you were becoming more mature. You may have done one of the following: started a business or been given a big promotion, received your college or master’s degree, married, published a book, had a baby, bought your first house, or chose something else that required effort and learning to accomplish. Now decades later, Saturn is back to give you a refresher course. He can only come to see you every 29.5 years, because that is how long he takes to revolve around the Sun and return to the same constellation. Think of Saturn as a high-priced consultant who can only work with you rarely, but whose wisdom you will need and will carry with you in the intervening nearly three decades, until he can come back to see you again.</p>

        <p>Whatever you choose to set out to do, it will be something you cannot easily undo later, and you would not want to undo the action because the very reason you are doing it is to give your life a firm foundation on which to build upon in the future. Saturn’s gift is to urge you to think ahead and plan for the future. If you work with him, you will be in a whole new place by the time he leaves in February 2026—leaner, wiser, with a great deal more authority than you were when the trend started last year in March 2023.</p>
<p>The new moon of March 10 in Pisces, 20 degrees, will be a pivotal moment when an opportunity will likely come up that you can choose to either take or leave. If you take it, the endeavor will require hard work, dedication, and concentration at nearly the exclusion of everything else with Saturn near your Pisces Sun. The stakes will be high for there will be more effort and possibly a major sum of money on the line.</p>
<p>For example, if you commit to going to college for an advanced degree, but give up, leave college, and don’t get the degree, you will have spent a lot of money and have a debt to pay off. If you buy a large, expensive house but later can’t find the money to meet the mortgage payments, you eventually will lose the house. And everything you had put into it earlier. Saturn raises the stakes so that you’ll stay committed even when life throws you a curve and becomes a little bumpy, as inevitably happens occasionally. Saturn wants you to be practical and objective as you make your initial commitment.</p>
<blockquote><p>This could turn out to be a major month for you, not only because it is your birthday time, but also because the new moon on March 10 is in Pisces.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Accompanying the new moon and Sun, and Saturn, will be Neptune, your ruling planet, whose job it is to take good care of you. Neptune’s presence suggests the opportunity that comes up will be creative and tap your imagination. Neptune has two sides of influence, however, and the other side can cause some confusion when he sends out his fog to soften reality (which also makes facts hard to see).</p>
<p>If you are talking about a new project, make sure you understand all the facets of the job—ask many questions. Find out precisely the scope of the job that you are expected to do for this will save you time and money by avoiding the need to backtrack.</p>
<p>If a project you are starting is complex, you will cover it with a contract. In that regard, Mercury rules contracts and will be beautifully oriented to Pluto, a major financial planet. This means you will be glad you discussed things thoroughly to banish assumptions and have the details of the job down on paper.</p>
<p>Romantically, this could be a great month for you, even though as the month opens, you seem to be hibernating a little, having worked hard in January and February. Additionally, Venus and Mars are tucked behind the scenes in Aquarius, not a special place for you.</p>

        <p>That changes, though, when Venus moves into Pisces on March 11 (the day after the new moon) to stay until April 4. Venus and Mars both promote new love, but very differently. Venus teaches the value of letting others come to you through magnetism, not through assertive actions—that’s Mars’ job. Venus comes by each year for three and a half to four weeks.</p>
<p>To make this point a bit clearer, some astrologers call Venus “the lazy planet” because she sits back and lets her beauty, charm, and charisma draw her lover (in this case, that’s Mars) to her. You will have this considerable hypnotic effect on others during the time Venus tours Pisces.</p>
<p>Mars is more aggressive, and he will be in Pisces from March 22 to April 30. Mars will make you more confident, courageous, persistent, and energetic. Mars will raise your profile in your circle and also make you more attractive. Mars will help you quite a bit not only in matters of love but also in business. Having Mars in your sign is a big advantage, and he visits your sign every two years.</p>
<p>To have both Venus and Mars in your sign is an even greater advantage. They will not conjoin, but that doesn’t matter—the point is, you will do well socially. Friends will be taking you out for your birthday, and among the friends you see, ask several of them to think about someone to introduce you to as a possible romantic interest. If you are attached, you will get much more attention from your spouse this month, which is always fun.</p>

        <p>The first of two eclipses will arrive this month as a full moon lunar eclipse on March 25 in Libra, 5 degrees. (The second one will arrive two weeks later as a new moon solar eclipse next month on April 8 in Aries, 19 degrees). Both will activate a financial house of your chart, and both are supremely positive and fully supportive. An eclipse will always bring change, and I feel with both eclipses, the changes you see will be very welcome. I will discuss next month’s eclipse in my April report to you.</p>
<p>This month’s eclipse will focus on your eighth house of other people’s money. This house rules taxes, tax refunds, bank loans, credit cards, mortgages, venture capital, inheritances, prize winnings, commissions, royalties, bonuses, valuable gifts, scholarships and financial aid, insurance payouts, court settlements, and the division of property at the end of a marriage or business. These are possible examples, but you can think of another possible source of income that may arrive for you on or near March 25.</p>
<p>One of these areas will reach a climax now and bring news within five days after March 25. I feel you will be elated with the news. Pluto, newly minted in Aquarius, is in a behind-the-scenes position and is in gorgeous “trine” (the most heavenly aspect you can get) to the full moon. Pluto is referencing someone in a powerful financial position behind closed doors who you can’t see but who acts as a major supporter for you.</p>
<p>You seem to be due some sort of one-time sum of money. It may be a major tax credit or a one-time fee from a job you did some time ago. If you have a court case pending, you may get the good news that the court favored you.</p>

        <p>Next month’s eclipse will bring in even more money for you, so stay optimistic. It will emanate from your earned income sector, so it will come from a different source. It is all good, dear Pisces.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>This could turn out to be a major month for you, not only because it is your birthday time, but also because the new moon on March 10 is in Pisces, arriving along with the Sun, Neptune, and Saturn. You are growing in maturity no matter what your age, and you are ready to take on more responsibility.</p>
<p>The new moon will be in lovely conversation with your ancient ruler Jupiter, planet of good fortune, and also with Uranus, planet of surprise and unexpected events. This new moon may bring you a writing or speaking project of importance, or it may cause you to travel suddenly. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive, so both may happen at once!</p>
<p>More good news: Mars is on the way to Pisces too, ready to arrive on March 22 to stay until April 30. This is the first time in two years you’ve had Mars in your sign, a great privilege, and generally marks a wonderful time to start something new, for Mars will give you presence, energy, and drive. Mars will give you the determination to follow your goal to success in the end.</p>

        <p>However, there is a caveat—April brings Mercury retrograde from April 1 to April 25, cutting into your special period of Mars in Pisces. This means you must initiate your biggest and most important goals now, in March, especially from March 22 to the end of the month, careful not to get too close to April 1 when Mercury turns retrograde.</p>
<p>If you have a project you had to put aside due to lack of time or funding, April, when Mercury is retrograde, would be a good time to start it up again, if that’s possible.</p>
<p>Venus will also move into Pisces, giving you extra sparkle, from March 11 to April 4. It will be a dazzling time to buy clothes for the coming season, for Pisces men and women to find a fresh new cologne or scent, and for women readers to choose new makeup. You would find madly flattering choices.</p>
<p>The full moon this month is also a lunar eclipse in Libra on March 25 and will bring financial talks to a conclusion. Pluto will be in a fine position to help this full moon, so you may make an agreement for a job, sale of property, or a loan that’s worth quite a bit of money, as some examples of what could result of this eclipse. It is unclear from where the generous sum that you are likely to see will emanate—it could come from a client, commission, bank, relative, or even from a charity raffle ticket.</p>
<p>Money is likely to flow out of your checkbook too, at this time, whether to pay to people you owe or to pay taxes, but it appears that you will have more than enough to cover bills this month with money left over for yourself. Venus will be in charge of this eclipse and will be beautifully oriented to good-fortune Jupiter and surprise-a-minute Uranus. The news you get at this time is likely to be entirely unexpected, in the best sense, and you’ll be happy to hear it.</p>
