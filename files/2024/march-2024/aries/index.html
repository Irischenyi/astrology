        <p>Your birthday is coming next month, and you are in a meditative, pensive mood. That’s precisely the right approach for March, for the ancient astrologers felt the month prior to one’s birthday was the perfect time to plan for your birthday year ahead. You have a new moon March 10, and at that time, the number of planets stacked up in your solar twelfth house can make you highly productive if you withdraw from the bustling world, close the door, and work quietly alone.</p>
<p>If you have a book to write, lyrics to a song to create, or a business plan to outline, this is your month to start. These are some examples, but you get the idea. Start working in earnest just after the new moon arrives on March 10.</p>
<p>The best aspects in your chart have to do with your ability to ask for, and receive, a high salary or, if self-employed, a generous fee from clients. You are still in your year of reward, which started in May of last year and will continue through most of May. This comes thanks to the presence of Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, in your second house of earned income, a privilege that happens every 12 years and lasts for a full year.</p>
<p>Uranus, the planet of surprise, is also in this same house, the one that rules your earned income. The combination of Jupiter and Uranus now is exuberantly positive and practically unbeatable. Everything you have done in the past decade will now be in line for generous compensation. Jupiter has been in this area of your chart ten months so far, so you may have already seen a major rise in income. If you have not asked for a raise or negotiated for a new high-level salary position, you have March, April, and May to make your appointment and present your case. Be confident!</p>

        <p>Good days to schedule a meeting to talk about money are:</p>
<p>March 1 when the Sun in Pisces and Jupiter in Taurus are in sync.</p>
<p>March 4 when Mercury in Pisces and Uranus in Taurus will be in lovely aspect.</p>
<p>March 9 when you will have the Sun in perfect conversation with Uranus in Taurus, making for a day you may be amazed at how well things will go.</p>
<p>Your social life looks quite active, and you are able to make new friends easily now. Mars, which is Aries’ ruler, is in your eleventh house of friendship and orbiting close to his lover Venus, both in Aquarius, an air sign that only makes your Aries fire-sign element burn more brightly. This should mark a happy time when you get quick invitations for parties, get-togethers, hastily made dinners, and invitations to just come over—all will easily fall into place in your calendar.</p>

        <p>The eleventh house also is the house of joy, hopes, and wishes, so something you dearly want may now materialize, after having worked toward that dream for some time. It is a very special place in the chart, and you are fortunate to have it so lit up by both Mars, your ruler, and gentle Venus.</p>
<p>When Mars leaves Aquarius on March 22 and enters Pisces, you will likely crave more rest and privacy and withdraw a little from socializing in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>April will bring Mercury retrograde from April 1 to April 25, so if you have to sign a contract, do so in March. The same is true if you want to buy an electronic item or something expensive, like a car or important furniture.</p>
<p>Even though Mercury will be out of phase next month, there will still be some special, jewel-like aspects that you will be able to use to your advantage in April, so don’t assume April will be a lost cause. I do want you to hurry along contacts and big-ticket purchases for now, but I will suggest many other actions you can do that will work out well for you in your April report.</p>
<p>The eclipses are back, and this year they are milder than the ones you went through in 2022 and 2023. In those years you may have experienced radical changes in your career and everyday lifestyle. Eclipses come in pairs, as a new moon and full moon, typically twice a year, which will happen this year.</p>

        <p>The first eclipse is due March 25 as a lunar full moon eclipse in Libra at 5 degrees. It will put a spotlight on your partner or serious collaborator in marriage or business. This is a gentle eclipse, and the lead planet will be Venus. Happily, Venus will be in superb condition and due to receive glittering rays from Jupiter in a “sextile,” meaning opportunity.</p>
<p>If you have been dating seriously, you may get engaged as a result of this eclipse—eclipses usually bring big life events that we often long remember afterwards. If you are married, your partner may have exciting news to share, and you both will benefit from it. This is a full moon, so a matter is coming to a final stage, giving you closure.</p>
<p>There is one glitch to this eclipse: Neptune will be in direct out-of-sign opposition to this full moon eclipse, so you must be absolutely sure about the steps you are taking. Hopefully, you will have done your due diligence and know the facts before you commit to a marriage or important contractual business alliance. It’s easy to be tempted to fill in the empty spaces of unknown information with assumptions, and that’s where the trouble can start.</p>
<p>The saving grace to this situation will come from Pluto, which will be highly supportive from his perch in your eleventh house of friends. This shows you should listen to your friends’ opinions about this matter, as their perspective may be sharper than yours in this instance. You seem to be eager to see this through to completion, but maybe you should slow down. The date of the eclipse, March 25, is just a week from April 1, the date Mercury will go retrograde, so your judgment may be off. By March 25, you will be close enough to feel the undertow of an unstable Mercury.</p>

        <p>If this relationship is real and good for you, you can always go into it a few weeks later, after you’ve had time to have more discussions with the person in question and perhaps do background checks.</p>
<p>If your birthday falls on March 25, or within five days of this date, or you have Aries rising 5 degrees, you will feel the results of this eclipse. The same is true if you have a planet or your natal moon at 5 degrees Aries (plus or minus five degrees). This is a full moon, so something ends, and something else begins.</p>
<p>On April 8 we will have a major new moon total eclipse of the Sun (a solar eclipse) appearing in Aries, 19 degrees. It is very likely to affect you if your birthday falls on April 8, or within five days of that date. You will also feel this if you have Aries rising within five degrees of 19 degrees, or if this eclipse coincides (within five degrees) of another natal planet or your natal moon that is close to 5 degrees in Aries. This is a rare eclipse that I will discuss next month in detail. You will love the effect of the April 8 eclipse—it comes filled with surprise opportunities for you.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>In early March you are in a pensive mode. Many planets are stacked up in your twelfth house of privacy, a good place to do reflective thinking about the future. Saturn, the great teacher, is orbiting close to the Sun in Pisces, so you are taking your life goals seriously—a good sign, for that is when goals become realized. Planets in Pisces also suggest that you have a great need to express your creative ideas in a meaningful, artistic way. You appear to be willing and able to do the hard work to craft something fresh, new, and complexly reflective of “you.” Jupiter will continue to orbit your second house of earned income, indicating that there’s generous money to be made too, so you will likely not only be getting applause but also substantial financial compensation.</p>

        <p>In matters of love, romance, and care of children, you may feel that life’s duties can sometimes be overwhelming, something you may have noticed last month on or near February 28. Still, you appear to be determined to stay the course and give your best effort, no matter how strenuous this phase may appear. You’re aware that to accomplish a relationship or worthy goal requires concentration and consistent effort, and you seem up to the task.</p>
<p>Life in March won’t be just about work, not by any means, because you have both Venus and Mars (called the cosmic lovers) still gliding closely through the compatible sign of Aquarius in your eleventh house of joy and social fun. Venus and Mars will allow you to bask in the warm glow of friendship.</p>
<p>It appears you’ve been cocooned at home, but now it’s time to venture out. You will get offers from friends to join in their activities, and you should accept, because they will be bound to be fun and too delicious to pass up. Mars is your ruler, and his position in your horoscope shows that despite your packed schedule that you will be following, you can—and will—find time for romance and relaxation</p>
<p>A full moon lunar eclipse is due on March 25 in your opposite sign of Libra, suggesting it will be time to decide about how you feel about a partner who holds a prominent position in your life, whether that’s in love or business.</p>

        <p>It might be a romantic partner you are dating seriously or if married, the eclipse may ask you to assess your relationship with your spouse. Alternatively, the eclipse could pertain to a business expert collaborator you have been thinking of joining forces with, ready to sign a contract soon. Neptune will closely oppose that full moon, so be careful not to assume too much about the character and background of the person. It’s common to want to fill in the blanks with assumptions if you don’t know someone very well. Listen to the opinions of friends whose vision of your relationship will be more objective than yours. In love or business, it would be best to go slowly.</p>
<p>At the same time, Jupiter, the good fortune planet, will be in fine agreement with Venus, the planet in the lead at this March 25 eclipse. As long as you have clear eyes entering the relationship and know each other as much as possible, it can be quite successful. Eclipses bring big changes and developments in the area of the chart in which they fall—for you, it’s the house of serious commitment to marriage or a collaborative business partnership. If you have already done your due diligence, the eclipse will hurry along your commitment to one another.</p>
<p>Eclipses deliver their dramatic news within a week of their arrival, but they are also known in some cases (about 10%) to bring dramatic events one month to the day earlier, or one month to the day later (15%), plus or minus five days in each time frame.</p>
<p>If a partner means a lot to you but you have been unhappy, you can find a way to fix the relationship. If, on the other hand, you feel your alliance has no future, you may take the courageous step to leave. Aries born March 25, plus or minus five days, are most likely to feel the effects of this full moon lunar eclipse. This is a positive eclipse. No matter what happens, this eclipse will be working to your benefit.</p>
