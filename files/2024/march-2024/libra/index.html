        <p style="font-weight: 400;">You are working harder than you have in recent memory, for you have a crowd of planets in Pisces and your sixth house of work-a-day projects. Those heavenly bodies are Neptune, Saturn, Mercury, the Sun, and a new moon on March 10—that is a lot of energy in one portion of the chart.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The new moon on March 10 will be in Pisces, 20 degrees, and with so many planets also in Pisces, it appears your work will be creative or artistic in nature. It might seem that all the people involved with your project(s) are calling out your name at once. You will have to be organized to keep everything on time and on budget.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">When Mars enters Pisces on March 22 (until April 30), you will be even busier, if that is possible! From Taurus, your eighth house of other people’s money, Jupiter and Uranus will send fat golden beams directly to the Sun and new moon in your sixth house of work projects. This is a sure sign that if you apply yourself to the job at hand, you can do unusually well financially—the best in over six years.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you work on commission, for bonuses or royalties, or with one-time project fees, you will be raking in money in large quantities. Money may alternatively come from a bank loan, mortgage, or venture capital, or it may come in from other sources like an inheritance, prize winning (such as from a charity raffle), or an insurance premium payout. You may get a tax refund or not have to pay as much as you imagined, or you may be awarded a generous sum from a court case or divorce settlement. The point is, your money seems to come in the form of a one-time payment, rather than a regular salary. The eighth house also rules the benefits you may be approved to receive from your company, so that’s another area to look at—those benefits can be valuable, too.</p>

        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Backtracking a little, the month will open on a sensational day, March 1, when the mighty Sun and good-fortune Jupiter will be in perfect agreement. The Sun will be in Pisces in your work assignment house, and Jupiter will be positioned in your financial house. March 1 would be an ideal day to interview for a new position or negotiate a deal on any front (including your future salary and benefits). If you are self-employed, start an advertising, publicity, or social media campaign. If you initiate it on this day, your chances of success are great!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Also, circle March 9, when the Sun and Uranus will be in perfect sync—you may surprise yourself again at how much of a money magnet you are. You will find yourself in the right place at the right time, in a perfect position to take advantage of an opportunity that could make you a tidy sum.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Do as much this month as you can, as next month, Mercury will be retrograde from April 1 to April 25. Sign papers in the first week of March (if possible), and buy electronic items in the first half of March—do not wait until April. This would include a car, smartphone, computer, washer-dryer, and so many other appliances. Even large or expensive items like furniture or mattresses should be purchased early in March, too.</p>
<blockquote><p>Your big moment of the month will be the full moon lunar eclipse in Libra on March 25. This could help you clarify what in life would make you truly happy.</p></blockquote>

        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, as background music to all your work activity, you have the potential for quite an active love life during the first days of March. Mars is still in Aquarius, a holdover from February 13, and will remain there until March 22. This is great news, for Mars will make you more attractive, confident, and in just the right mood for love in your off hours. Mars will be filling your fifth house of new love in the first three weeks of March.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Best of all, Venus is in Aquarius too, orbiting close to her lover Mars in this same sector of love, romance, creativity, children, and fun. When these two planets are together, they set off alluring sparks of new love between two people—their job is to kindle the stirrings of love by supplying the right chemistry. Venus is known to be the planet that supplies charisma, charm, and unmistakable magnetism.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">When Venus and Mars are together, they can also make love grow and deepen between two people who are already in love. Find time to circulate if you are unattached, and if you are in a relationship, plan private time with your partner to celebrate your commitment to each other.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To summarize, Mars will remain in the divine-for-you sign of Aquarius until March 22. Venus will be in your truelove sector (also a holdover from last month) until March 11.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Your big moment of the month will be the penumbral lunar eclipse and full moon in Libra on March 25 at 5 degrees. All eclipses bring change, and this one could signify a shift in how you view yourself, your priorities, and your goals. This could help you clarify what in life would make you truly happy. Knowing the answer to this question may sound easy, but many people are unsure of themselves in this respect. At this point, you will know. As a result of the transformation taking place within you, you may change your appearance in some appreciable way after the eclipse arrives.</p>

        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Eclipses are on a mission to produce progress, so events often happen that bolt the door on the past in one part of your life. Eclipses are non-negotiable—your only path is the one forward, and you won’t be able to rewind the tape to go back to how things were in earlier times. And you would not want to!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This a full moon eclipse—that means something is ending so that something new can begin. When the universe, in its wisdom, decides you have learned as much as you can in one area of life, the eclipse ends that circumstance or relationship in order to push you forward.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you were born early in the sign, on September 27, plus or minus four days, you will feel this eclipse. The same is true if you have Libra rising between 0 degrees and 8 degrees or a natal planet or your natal moon in Libra within four degrees of 5 degrees.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Look to see if you have any natal planets at 5 degrees (plus or minus four degrees) in Libra, Aquarius, Gemini, Aries, Leo, or Sagittarius—if you do, that natal planet will light up and send benefits to you from this eclipse.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Note: You can do your <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/natal-birth-chart/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.astrologyzone.com/natal-birth-chart/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709176301955000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0vH8BSGM881Wr3Ho-DjFIU">natal chart</a> on Astrology Zone for free if you know your time of birth. If you don’t have your time of birth, you can’t discover your rising sign (which is equal in importance to your Sun sign), but you will see where your planets are scattered and in what sign and degree—look to see if you have any planets close to 5 degrees Libra.</p>

        <p style="font-weight: 400;">I love the March 25 lunar full moon eclipse because it will bring superb help from powerhouse Pluto in your fifth house of love and romance. This house also covers the birth and care for children and the blossoming of your creativity, and one of these areas will benefit in a big way. You may get a new assignment that taps into your sophisticated sense of taste. If you are single and hoping to meet someone special, you may meet that person—the one who will quietly transform your life when you both gradually fall in love. You or your partner might get pregnant or give birth during this eclipse, a very happy, loving event that can grow into immense joy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This eclipse will also highlight your health, and happiness planet and protector Jupiter will be in the right place to offer help to you, along with Pluto, the planet that engenders immense regenerative powers. This eclipse might prove to you that, indeed, there is such a thing as a positive, helpful eclipse.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You are always evolving and growing, dear Libra, but you have been so busy doing things that need to be done that you probably did not notice how much you have changed. You have grown in maturity during the process of living and can handle more now than you could even a few years ago. An eclipse will help you catch up with the image of the person you have evolved into today, and when you catch a glimpse of yourself—a picture provided by the eclipse—you will like what you see.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Many planets are stacking up in your assignment sector, so it’s clear that when you enter the month you will need to hit the ground running. It will seem like everyone needs your opinion. Others will also want your ideas for taking projects in a new, fresh direction, so you will need to keep your wits about you.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The new moon on March 10 will get the ball rolling with a flurry of activity in the workplace. You may feel like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnHiAWlrYQc" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DAnHiAWlrYQc&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709176301955000&amp;usg=AOvVaw13jctECY31vIOG7t4nCTgO">Lucille Ball in the chocolate factory</a>, valiantly trying to keep up with the never-ending assembly line of chocolates to wrap.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You seem not to be ruffled, though, for your enthusiasm for your work will be high, and your intuition will be strong, allowing your recommendations to flow naturally. Having many planets in Pisces suggests the work will tap into your imagination and creativity—possibly this work will be precisely your cup of tea.</p>

        <p style="font-weight: 400;">You need to remain as realistic and objective as possible during this time, as Neptune will create some confusion—be sure you know exactly what your client needs you to do. It would be worth sending an email summarizing your client’s expectations to be sure you both are on the same page. That will help you avoid backtracking and redoing part of the project later, for not only is Neptune cranking out fog, but soon Mercury retrograde will, too.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mercury will be retrograde next month, April 1 to April 25, so get as much done this month as you can. Even though Mercury will go a bit haywire next month and create delays, April does offer a number of beautiful days that burst with opportunity, so don’t assume next month will be a washout.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Venus and Mars are both in your ultra-compatible sign of Aquarius and your fifth house of true love, the ideal place for you. This is a holdover from the rare conjunction that Venus and Mars made last month in Aquarius on February 22. These cosmic lovebirds will still be close enough in early March to spread joy throughout your love life, and they can also help matters related to pregnancy and the tender care of children. If you are currently single and hoping to meet your one truelove, by all means circulate in the first days of the month before Venus moves into Pisces on March 11. As another bonus, Venus and Mars will also spark your artistic side and help you create things of beauty.</p>

        <p style="font-weight: 400;">The full moon on March 25 will be an important one for you, for it is a full moon lunar eclipse in Libra, 5 degrees. This will affect you strongly if you are a September-born Libra (on or within four days of September 27) or if you have Libra rising (from 0 to 8 degrees). You may get a new opportunity that is right up your alley or wrap up a major project you are working on—to quite a bit of applause from higher-ups.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Venus will take the lead at this eclipse and is in direct contact with Jupiter (money) and Uranus (surprise), so this could be a very gratifying time for you—you may get paid a generous amount on this full moon or be given another assignment that is more complex and that pays even more generously.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Yet this full moon lunar eclipse portends more than just work-related results. The most important way this eclipse can affect you is by helping you see your personality traits, talents, skills, and growing maturity in a new light. You may now come to appreciate all you’ve learned and accomplished in the past that has led you to this moment. You may, as a result, reshuffle your priorities as you look forward.</p>

        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Eclipses often change timetables—things you were eventually going to do may suddenly become a priority now. You feel the passage of time at an eclipse, for eclipses often bring milestones that you will remember for years afterward. This may motivate you to make your time count for more in either your private, emotional life or your public, career life.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Neptune will be in an out-of-sign opposition to the full moon eclipse on March 25, in a wide, yet mathematically significant aspect that can cause you to make erroneous assumptions that could lead you down the wrong path. This was true earlier in the month and will be underscored again during this full moon eclipse. Listen to the opinions of your close friends and relatives, for their point of view concerning your situation may be more accurate than yours. Don’t make any assumptions in a month when Neptune is active and Mercury is rolling toward a retrograde April 1. If you have to sign papers in March, see a lawyer, for his advice will be worth far more than his fees.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Pluto will be magnificently supportive to you during the Libra lunar eclipse on March 25, and that’s a huge bonus. Pluto is in your fifth house of true love, which also rules conception and birth. Pluto is known to transform, so in your case, you may be greatly changed by the power of love in all of its magical manifestations.</p>
