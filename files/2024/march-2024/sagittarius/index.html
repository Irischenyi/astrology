        <p>Lately you’ve had people to see and places to go, mainly for work, but for some personal reasons, too. Mars went into Aquarius last month on February 13, and ever since, you may have been traveling a bit more than usual, but only going short distances. I know you prefer to travel long distances to foreign countries, or at the very least to a distant city in your own country, but that’s not in your outlook for now.</p>
<p>You will see that as the month progresses, events will keep pulling your attention back home. Migrating planets on the move in March will be in a hurry to get you to focus on your fourth house of home and family. You will start to see evidence of this just after the new moon arrives on March 10—and its emphasis can last for weeks and months.</p>
<p>The new moon on March 10 is in Pisces, 20 degrees, and you will also have the Sun, Neptune, and Saturn in Pisces. Saturn’s presence seems to suggest you are willing to do whatever it takes to reach a home-related goal, such as buying a house or condo. You might sacrifice pleasures, such as dining out, buying an expensive handbag, or taking vacations, in order to make this happen.</p>
<p>You may hope to make a radical change to your own living quarters by moving to a new house, buying or renting a vacation home, or renovating your current space. Or you could decide to decorate, make small repairs, do maintenance, or simply add a few stylish touches to your home. In any case, you can achieve much in March.</p>

        <p>If you want to focus on people involved with your home, such as a roommate who ate up most of the chocolates in the box your sweetheart gave you for Valentine’s Day or gobbled up your two rib lamb chops while you were traveling last week, you probably have come to the conclusion that this person has got to go. If so, voice your feelings after the new moon appears on March 10.</p>
<p>If you are disputing a problem with a neighbor, this could be a good time to open talks and finally settle the matter. Alternatively, if you don’t like the plans of the architect, interior designer, or contractor you’re working with, you may need to negotiate changes that are more in line with the original plan you had envisioned. You can successfully start a discussion this time around.</p>
<p>The fourth house of home also rules your parents, so you may be helping with a task that is a bit overwhelming for your mother or father. A happy moment could arrive when your sister, brother, or cousin announces the arrival of a baby, bringing the entire family together to celebrate this tiny new life. There are many possible examples.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thanks to Jupiter and Saturn, you may see a chance at financial security and stability that might not come around again in such agreeable form—so take it.</p></blockquote>

        <p>If your daughter has a small child and needs help to pay for kindergarten so she can go back to work, you might choose to help her with that child’s tuition. If your mother needs to have a live-in aide or you need to move her to an assisted living facility, but you can’t quite afford to do so by yourself, you will find ways, possibly through government programs, to help her because you love her.</p>
<p>I like your outlook for the progress you will make with home and family. Jupiter, your ruler and good-fortune planet, and Uranus, planet of surprise, will both be sending golden vibrations to that new moon March 10—that’s a major advantage.</p>
<p>In your career, whether you are self-employed or work for others, business will be strong and consistent through May and possibly beyond. You will have many projects, so money seems to continue to pour in to cover the home improvements you might want to make (or the money you might want to give to a family member).</p>
<p>For other Sagittarians, the arrival of Saturn, the planet that matures us and teaches us life lessons, has brought somewhat extreme changes to home or family in the last year (Saturn entered this part of your chart in March 2023 for the first time in 29 years and will remain until February 2026, a period of nearly three years). You are an unsinkable, optimistic soul, but Saturn’s entry into your home sector has also forced you to become cautious, practical, and realistic when it comes to real estate matters.</p>
<p>You realize that you can only buy what you can afford, factoring changeable life events into the equation that might require you to access cash from savings or family. This is not indicated in your chart in the foreseeable time ahead, but most people have 15 -or 30-year mortgages, so consider when you settle home-related matters that you need to stay closer to home and not take as many trips to places you’ve never been. Having a nest egg may become a more pressing priority.</p>

        <p>I say this because Saturn is the ruler of Sagittarius’ second house of income and wealth, and now that it has settled into your home sector, your investment in your home or other real estate becomes your new source of security as you move forward.</p>
<p>This will be underscored by another lovely cosmic coincidence. In June 2023, Saturn and Jupiter made an exact friendly sextile aspect, and because they move so slowly, they are still in a mathematically significant aspect. In the early part of 2024 (including now), these two planets are within four degrees of a sextile to each other.</p>
<p>A sextile happens when planets are at the same degree in signs that are sixty degrees apart—an outstandingly friendly aspect that brings opportunity that you can choose to take or leave. There is no predestination in astrology, but this aspect is so good that it can help you set up a firm foundation for your life for now and into the distant future. You may see that this is a chance at financial security and stability that might not come around again in such agreeable form—so take it.</p>
<p>Turning now to the stylishness of your home, Venus will move into your home sector in Pisces on March 11, the day after the new moon on March 10. Venus will remain here from March 11 until April 4, so during that time your design choices are likely to be beautiful. Venus will also make this a perfect time to entertain, mixing friends and family together and inviting people and children of all different ages to your home.</p>
<p>Mars is on the way to your home and family sector too, from March 22 until April 30. Mars, being the action planet, will give you the energy and motivation to put home -and family-related plans in place. Mars takes two years to circle the Sun, so it’s been that long since you’ve had Mars’ assertive, high-energy help in your home sector. If you need to buy any electronic items, such as a washer-dryer, vacuum cleaner, computer, car, home security system, smartphone, or a home landline system—any electronics—do it in early March.</p>

        <p>Mars will be hampered by his brother Mercury’s antics next month as Mercury will go retrograde from April 1 to April 25. That will cut into a large swath of the time that Mars will be in your home sector. It is never wise to buy expensive or electronic items (including furniture) when Mercury is retrograde. It is also not good to close on a house or sign a rental lease during that time (you will see problems come up if you do, or you may not stay there very long).</p>
<p>Admittedly, there are good things that happen during Mercury retrograde as well. For example, if you had bid on a house but lost out to another family, you may be invited back by the seller to bid on the house again. The person who won the bid may not have been approved by his bank for a mortgage (among many other possibilities). In another example, you may spend time packing up things you no longer need to give to charity. Mercury is an intellectual planet and will urge you to go back and reconfigure your space, perhaps inspiring you to give items away.</p>
<p>Now let’s talk about the coming full moon lunar eclipse on March 25 in Libra, 5 degrees, which will fall in your eleventh house of friendship. Eclipses always spell change, so your relationship with a friend could undergo a change. For example, he or she could get married and move away.</p>
<p>Often an eclipse will “eclipse out” someone from your everyday environment. Full moons often bring a large social event that you may be going to within days of Monday, March 25 (that event is likely to take place over the weekend of March 23-24 or during the week of March 25).</p>

        <p>The most significant aspect of the eclipse on March 25 will be the shimmering beam that Pluto will send to this full moon in your friendship house. Pluto is in your third house, so you may travel a short distance to see a friend or get an email or phone call with news. This is very positive, and since Pluto is so powerful, this is a significant aspect that will color the eclipse—it’s why I feel you will like the overall events of this eclipse.</p>
<p>There is another way things could work out at the March 25 eclipse. The eleventh house, where the eclipse falls in your chart, rules social groups and associations. Any time people gather for a singular reason or cause, that’s an eleventh house activity. If you belong to a club or organization where you have long hoped to take on a leadership position, you might see that dream realized now at eclipse time.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Your luckiest day of the month will show up instantly on March 1, when Jupiter in Taurus will work sublimely with the Sun in Pisces. Every sign is born with a ruling planet that is tasked with taking good care of that sign, and your ruler is Jupiter. That means March 1 will be a fortunate day that will favor everyone, but doubly so for you because Jupiter will watch out for you and help you. Use this day to stretch for a successful outcome on something difficult or to achieve an action that will give you an edge over others. You will have Jupiter’s support, for sure.</p>
<p>You are favored for a variety of goals this month, including ones related to home or family decisions or goals having to do with work assignments or the hiring of people who report to you at home or work. If you focus on any of these areas, you will do well. If you are moving into a new house or apartment this month, it looks as though you will love your new space and will want to remain there a long time.</p>
<p>Your concentration on your home will continue and be boosted in a big way at the new moon on March 10 and in the weeks that follow it. No matter what you plan that happens to be related to home, you stand to find the right experts, and an array of choices will start to show up after the new moon appears. You seem to be thinking about moving, making repairs, or working with a contractor. Or perhaps you’d simply like to refresh your space with a chic new design.</p>

        <p>Neptune will be near the new moon in Pisces, and that could bring you concern in the coming weeks over water problems connected to your home. You may need a professional to fix the plumbing or improve the purity of your water. Or you may be concerned with a buildup of snow on the roof or driveway. You might also be involved with checking for mold or clearing out water that caused a small flood in your basement. You may be relieved to find no water damage or concern this month, but nevertheless, find ways to strengthen your home against water damage.</p>
<p>You would be wise to look into buying insurance to cover any possible water-related problems at home because Neptune, who governs water, will stay in your home sector for several more years. Jupiter, the good fortune planet and your ruler, will be working with Saturn in a rare aspect, making sure your investment in your home (no matter what you do) will pay off in happiness and appreciation of the value of your home.</p>
<p>Family—with special emphasis on your parents or those you think of as parents—also forms part of your fourth sector of home that is being accented by the new moon on March 10. Instead of centering your attention on your physical home, you might instead direct this new moon’s energy toward helping a parent or other family member this month who is having difficulty with something. You may offer an idea or solution to them that is apt to be hailed as genius. You may wonder why you never thought of this idea before.</p>
<p>While you are concentrating on home, consider setting up a comfortable home office. Saturn is in your home sector giving you a foundation of stability, and he also makes contact with lucky Jupiter in your assignment sector. Money will flow generously to you when working at home while also appreciating the value and comfort of your space.</p>

        <p>If you are proud of your home décor or are an accomplished home chef, you might want to invite an important client over for dinner (if you don’t cook, you can always cater the meal). If this idea sounds possible, your invitation to your client could work to increase your income over time. You will become closer to your client while also gaining further understanding of his or her needs.</p>
<p>If you decide to sell furniture or other items you have at home but no longer need on an auction website, that would be another source of income. Keep in mind that money and your ability to build wealth are strongly linked, so large sums of money will flow through your home in any of the ways I have suggested (and any others you can think of, too).</p>
<p>Not all your time will be spent thinking about home and family. Venus and Mars met in conjunction last month in Aquarius (a sign supremely compatible to yours) in your quick travel sector. This is always a joyous moment—Venus and Mars are the cosmic lovers, and you love to be on the road. These two lovebirds will still be close enough in early March to offer you a chance to flee for a joyous romantic weekend away.</p>
<p>When these two adoring planets part, you will have one other chance to travel. You might have a social event you’ve been looking forward to attending over the weekend of March 23 -24. Indeed, that would be a standout time for travel.</p>

        <p>The full moon on March 25 will boost your social life too, either over the weekend prior, mentioned above, or in one or more of the five days that follow this full moon. You will likely be invited to a special social event, which might require you to travel a short distance.</p>
<p>By this time of the month, Venus will have orbited close to Saturn, so you seem to be in a serious state of mind. The event you attend may be special and meaningful to you for the long-term implications it has for a friendship. For example, it could be bittersweet if your close friend gets married and moves away, “eclipsing” her out of your daily environment.</p>
<p>The March 25 eclipse may have a different message if you belong to a club, charity, or humanitarian organization. If you want to take on a chairmanship or presidency, you may be elected or named to the presidency near the time of the eclipse. Follow up with the interesting new people you meet after you get home.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the social event near the lunar eclipse in Libra on March 25 might be work-related and find you going to a convention or seminar to further your knowledge of new and emerging developments in your industry. If this is how you experience the full moon lunar eclipse, financial planet Jupiter and surprise planet Uranus will be on hand to help and will see that you make good money as a result of your efforts.</p>
