        <p>This should be a very happy month for you since the part of your chart that is most lit up involves love, romance, leisure, entertainment, sports, and fun, as well as pregnancy, birth, and the tender care of children. Your creativity and imagination are also tucked gently into this area of your chart, and all of these areas can show growth and exciting development in March. It will be up to you to show the universe which area is your priority, for then you can direct substantial energy to that part of life where you want most to see something happen.</p>
<p>Over the years, you’ve been very focused on career, but lately, you’ve started to see that a life only filled with career success can seem flat, and you’ve been thinking about making the private side of your life richer and emotionally satisfying. You were very successful in this new priority—to enjoy love and a home life—in 2021 and most of 2022. If everything went right, you saw that life has many facets that shone brilliantly at the same time your career was growing. Usually, one has to concentrate on career or love life, but lucky you had the aspects that could benefit both at the same time.</p>
<p>This month, thanks to a sweet new moon March 10 in Pisces, 20 degrees, you will have one of the best shots of 2024 to expand and develop your private, emotional life with deepening love and romance. New moons stay in effect for weeks and months—precisely five and a half months—gradually getting weaker until the full moon arrives in the very same sign (Pisces) to end the new moon’s influence and replace it with the full moon’s culmination. That will happen this year on the full moon lunar eclipse on September 17 in Pisces (don’t be concerned—it will be incredibly friendly).</p>
<p>I love this month’s new moon on March 10 for a variety of reasons. First, both Jupiter and Uranus will be setting up a strong link between your fifth house of true love and your seventh house of marriage and commitment. Partnerships of all kinds—serious, commitments in love and marriage and also commitments in business—will shine. Usually, alliances formed in this house are sealed with a contract (and you sign papers when you wed, although, because it is so romantic, we often forget marriage is a contract). All relationships dazzle for you this month.</p>

        <p>Joining forces, whether in love, by getting engaged or married, or making promises to a business partner, now should turn out to be quite successful.</p>
<p>I will say this: This month, March, for Scorpio will be all about romantic love, and later, two months from now in May, you will find it to be the ideal month to make a joyous commitment.</p>
<p>In terms of business, March will be about blossoming creativity and profits made with a business partner or middleman—you will benefit from having an intermediary or someone to speak for you. Some examples of a business partner, to get you thinking, aside from a bone fide business partner, would be your accountant, bookkeeper, lawyer, agent, writing partner, publicist—even a wedding planner. You may be switching to a new professional if you have one of these sorts of people in your life. A partner in business works with you in a confidential, one-to-one way. You prize this person for their expertise, current knowledge of their industry, and perhaps their contacts that would help you get ahead with your business.</p>
<p>The place of the March 10 new moon, at 20 degrees Pisces in your fifth house, holds several planets in addition to the Sun and new moon. You have Saturn, the teacher planet, in Pisces too, which will stay until February 2026. Saturn demands much but delivers enormous long-term security, if you work with Saturn and meet his challenges.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you are dating and serious about each other, this could be a landmark month, for you may get engaged or wed.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Having Saturn in your fifth house for the first time in three decades means that over the past year and looking forward until early 2026, love is serious for you, not at all frivolous or casual. If you are single, you will want to meet, marry, and begin building a life with the person of your dreams. You would not want to tell your life story over and over to each new person you date—you are ready for a serious relationship. That new maturity will be attractive. (Becoming more mature and longing for a stable marriage happens at different ages for different people.)</p>
<p>If you are dating seriously, your sweetheart is leading the relationship now, and all indications are that your partner is ready to commit to you. Your partner may not be sure if you are ready to wed, so if you like, this month you can drop a subtle hint. I say this only if you have been dating a reasonable amount of time. Dropping hints about wanting to wed too early in the relationship will only drive a partner away. Timing is everything, but you certainly do have lovely aspects in March, April, and May.</p>
<p>If you are already married, you likely need more fun. Your partner is doing well (judging by the position of Jupiter), and you are benefiting from his or her prosperity, or soon will. Consider the idea of weaving a memory—it would be an ideal month to take a vacation together, if only just for a long weekend.</p>
<p>Another possible influence of Saturn in the fifth house is that conception is taking a little longer than you anticipated, and as said, this trend will continue through February 2026. Start trying early. Saturn will not prevent you from having a baby, but it does show that you might need the help of a fertility expert.</p>
<p>If you have a baby and are feeling surprised at how much work is involved with such a little creature, rest assured, it gets easier. This is Saturn’s influence, and by February 2026, you will be in a completely new place. By then, taking care of your child or children will be far more fun than work, so hang in there, and accept help for the time being.</p>

        <p>Besides Saturn, you also have Neptune in your fifth house, the same place (Pisces) as the new moon March 10. Neptune is the planet of unconditional love and a very idealistic planet. You see the best in your romantic partner and also in children you might have. This is a lovely quality.</p>
<p>Neptune can sometimes make a person a bit too idealistic, however. In love, Neptune can make you, at first, breathlessly blind. If you don’t know your sweetheart well, you could be tempted to imagine many beautiful qualities in the person you are dating, but your partner may not deserve all your adulation. I am bringing this to your attention because this new moon has a strong presence from Neptune. Enjoy the relationship, but don’t elope to the Elvis chapel in Las Vegas—not yet.</p>
<p>We all like to fill in the blanks when we are happily falling in love, but with Neptune very prominent at the new moon (and later, the full moon, as you will soon see in my report), you need to go slow and be cautious. If you have been dating for a long time, then you do know your partner well. If you don’t, get opinions from family and close friends. In business, you will need to do background checks to be sure that your partner in business deserves those praises.</p>
<p>You have time, so there is no need to rush. Jupiter, the good fortune planet, and Uranus, planet of surprise, are moving closer to each other every day, and this is a fabulous and rare feature of 2024. By the end of March, these two titans of the zodiac will be within four tiny degrees of each other in Taurus. On April 20, next month, they will make a historic conjunction in your seventh house of business/love partnerships.</p>
<p>After April 20, 2024, Jupiter and Uranus will not meet again like this until 2037, but by then, they will meet in a different part of your chart and a different sign, Cancer. This year, April 20, or the days surrounding that date, could turn out to be a landmark date. It is an aspect of hope, happiness, and optimism and will give us all a lift in spirits.</p>

        <p>There is a problem with next month, however—Mercury will be retrograde nearly all month, from April 1 to April 25. Because marriage is a contract, you would always need the planet of contracts, Mercury, in good, strong shape when you wed. In April, Mercury will be weak and debilitated. If you are ready to sign a contract, do so in March—the first week brings stellar aspects.</p>
<p>Early March would also be the time to buy a car, computer, smartphone, new TV, expensive headset, or any other electronic item you might have on your list. Also, don’t wait to buy an expensive item in April, such as furniture, a mattress, or precious gems. You will enjoy the item a lot more if you avoid buying these types of products in April. In March and May, your judgment will be working well, firing on all cylinders.</p>
<p>May is due to be the happiest, most divine, month of the year. It holds the Luckiest Days of this year, May 17-18, and so many other jewel-like, sparkling aspects. It’s like the universe spilled a sack of diamonds from its palm and scattered them all over the night sky—there are so many wonder days! You can see them all on my calendar that I sell on Astrology Zone—I list them and tell you why they are special right on the day they happen. (See my home page or click here to see more information. This is best done on your laptop or desktop rather than your phone.)</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the activities of Mars, one of the ruling planets of Scorpio, which is in your fourth house of home and family as the month opens. Mars has been moving through Aquarius since last month, February 13, when you may have been focused on improving the look and feel of your home—moving, renovating, making repairs, doing maintenance, asking the painters to come in, or refreshing the décor.</p>
<p>If you feel your home or other property you own or rent is fine as is, you might instead have been focused on helping a family member, such as a parent or one of your children. Mars will remain in this area of your chart until March 22, so you still have time when you can make the most progress.</p>

        <span class="auther-name">by Susan Miller</span>
        <p>One other idea: Mars brings noise and activity, so you may have been (or want to start) entertaining friends and family at home—a good idea to do so in the first three weeks of March.</p>
<p>Venus is traveling with Mars, a lucky coincidence as these two planets are called the cosmic lovers. Venus is stronger when her partner Mars is with her, and Mars strengthens his ability to spark love between strangers when Venus is nearby. Last month they met in conjunction on February 22, a special day, and will stay close in the first half of March. That’s another reason making design decisions would be favored in March, and entertaining at home rather than in a restaurant or club would be favored.</p>
<p>There is one possible challenge at home: Mars and Uranus are at loggerheads on March 9. This is NOT a day to make any plans for home or family or to entertain—it will just be too volatile.</p>
<p>Once you get to March 22, Mars will move into Pisces, your happy place, for at that time Mars will enter your fifth house of love and romance. Mars, the high energy planet, will take the opportunities that the new moon of March 10 began to open to a higher level, namely in matters of love, romance, parties, leisure, vacations, and regarding the having and caring for children. Things will start bubbling up quickly.</p>
<p>This is the first time in two years you’ve had this level of assistance from Mars in this area of your chart. If you are creative, a project you wanted to do but had to put aside during the pandemic could jump to life now. You will see all these topics reignite now. Keep these dates in mind:</p>
<p>Mars moves through Pisces and your fifth sector from March 22 to April 30.</p>

        <p>Venus will move through Pisces, the most divine place for Venus to be for you, from March 11 to April 4.</p>
<p>Get ready for heavenly romance, dear Scorpio. With Mercury retrograde next month, a romantic flame from your past may reappear to see if the two of you a make a go of the relationship again.</p>
<p>In this busy month, you also have a full moon lunar eclipse on March 25 in Libra, 5 degrees, in the quietest part of your chart—the twelfth house.</p>
<p>If when hearing the word “eclipse” you start to shudder, don’t worry one bit. The difficult eclipses that you had to endure as far back as November 2021 and through 2022 and 2023 are over. You will not see any more eclipses in Scorpio and your opposite sign of Taurus to uproot your life anytime soon. At those eclipses, there was a heavy-duty planet—unpredictable Uranus—in the wrong place at the wrong time, and Uranus triggered so much unexpected change for you. No more—that is receding into your past.</p>
<p>This eclipse on March 25 could make you want to pull back and treat yourself to rest and time for reflection. Scorpio is a private sign, and you like to review past events to think about them and find meaning in them.</p>
<p>If anyone has withheld a secret from you, you will find out at this full moon eclipse. Neptune will be opposed to the full moon (in an out-of-sign opposition, but still mathematically significant), and Neptune will be wide conjunct the Sun. That aspect usually brings truth out into the open.</p>

        <span class="auther-name">by Susan Miller</span>
        <p>It is hard to say how you will react—it could be a good secret or one that shocks you, and in that case, you will need time to meditate on it as well as find out the reason that person withheld it from you. I am not saying this will definitely happen—not at all—but because there is a chance this would come up for some Scorpios, I don’t want you to feel blindsided by the incident. It could have something to do with a work project that is coming to culmination at the office.</p>
<p>The best part about this full moon lunar eclipse in Libra is that Pluto in Aquarius will be in ideal angle and degree to support this full moon. This tells me that your family will support you 100%, and they will stand by to help you if there’s anything you need. Jupiter and Uranus will send you a big bouquet of sparkling aspects too, so your partner will also support you in every way possible.</p>
<p>Neptune, as said, will be spinning fog by being so close to the Sun in an out-of-sign opposition to the full moon, but Neptune’s simply outnumbered. Also, with Saturn in the same house as Neptune, you will stay clear-eyed, practical, and realistic. The smart money is betting on you to make all the right choices, dear Scorpio.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You are a hard worker, and you drive yourself to excel, but March is made for romance. Not since 2022 have you had as much planetary support in this area of your life. If you are single and ready for a genuine, supportive, and long-term relationship, the new moon of March 10 will be your friend.</p>

        <p>Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, will be staunchly allied to this new moon from his position in your seventh house of marriage. If you are dating and serious about each other, this could be a landmark month, for you may get engaged or wed. If you are single and not dating, you will likely meet the kind of partners that you’d say are marriage material. Be out and about, circulating as much as you can.</p>
<p>The same area of the chart is known to bring happiness through children. If you hope for a baby, this would be the month to get serious about starting your family or adding another child—as they say, the force is with you. If you have children, plan a surprise for them—something special, such as a trip that will build a memory.</p>
<p>This new moon will also help you find joy in your creativity and further encourage your talent to blossom. If you apply yourself to your craft, you may be surprised by the quality of your output. Begin your project after the new moon appears, March 10, and you will have something you will be proud to show others.</p>
<p>In addition to the new moon, you have an enchanting Venus about to move into the perfect sign for you—Pisces—from March 11 until April 4. Sunday, March 24, could be very special because Venus will send a missive to Jupiter, linking your sector of love to the one of marriage. If you are not ready to wed, you may make a commitment or promise to your partner that will help you both build the relationship, such as to save together for a house, have a baby, or take a long-desired vacation.</p>

        <p>Enjoy the romantic vibrations that will be in the air until you get to the full moon eclipse on March 25 in Libra. After the eclipse appears, you will enter a time when you’ll want rest and privacy. A full moon eclipse in the twelfth house, as you will have, can cause a secret to quickly move to the surface. It may be a secret someone withheld from you, or it could be a secret that you withheld from others.</p>
<p>Secrets come in all shapes and sizes—some are a delight, others are not—but learning the contents of a secret can help you protect yourself, even if the secret is one you hoped never to hear. On the other hand, if you have a secret you are holding in, be careful, for this full moon may bring your secret out in the open. You have so many good aspects all month, I can’t imagine anything that would ruffle your little feathers.</p>
<p>Also in March, especially in the early part of the month, you seem to continue to have a lot of activity centered on your home. With your ruler Mars in your home sector until March 22, you can be highly productive when achieving home-related goals. You may be intent to find a new house or condo to buy, to call in the painters, make repairs, or plan a redesign of your home—you choose the one that feels best. I sense your home is feeling small and that you need more space. With Mars’ lover Venus also in your home sector until March 11 (the day after the new moon), you are likely to adore the beautiful results you achieve no matter what you choose to do.</p>
<p>Once Venus leaves your home sector on March 11 and Mars leaves March 22, they both will enter your fifth house of true love, but both will work with the new moon March 10 to make your emotional life richer and more romantic. Feather your (home) nest, dear Scorpio, and then invite love in.</p>
