        <p>Most of the little transiting planets are on the western side of your chart, so other people in your circle and new people who you will collaborate with will play a role in how the events go this month. You won’t have total control, as the planets are suggesting more of a team, group effort will be necessary where everyone has a vote.</p>
<p>The way you will get ahead will be through cooperating with others, listening to their ideas, and suggesting ways their ideas could be made even better. You are a mutable sign, meaning you are inherently flexible and adaptable, so you should not have difficulty navigating through March. It is due to be a very positive month with plenty of opportunity to progress.</p>
<p>The Sun will be in Pisces, warming your seventh house, which is the house of committed relationships. On the very first day of the month, March 1, Jupiter will be in communication with the Sun, so making a distant trip with your sweetheart/spouse would be quite divine. If you travel to see a client, that, too, should be a good idea, as profits are likely to result. This month, foreign people, places, and global markets glow. If you cannot travel on March 1, or later in the month, you may be communicating via phone and email with foreign people quite a bit working on a big job.</p>
<p>On March 9 Uranus will contact the Sun in a beautifully beneficial way, and again, travel would be a wonderful idea for you and your partner, or you might spontaneously pitch or work with an overseas client.</p>

        <p>Very soon Jupiter will enter your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement, and your career will catch fire and blaze brilliantly for a full year. This glorious trend will start on May 25, 2024, and continue until June 9, 2025. Once you enter this period, you likely won’t travel because your time will be consumed with career opportunities, which will be just like popcorn popping in a hot pot—coming to you quickly and in abundance. You won’t want to take your eyes off the prize to travel. In time, during that glorious year, you may travel for business, but it won’t quite be the same. Now is the time to enjoy your spouse in a way you’ve not been able to in a long time. If you need to see a client for a new business project, go, for your time away will be worthwhile and rewarded.</p>
<p>On March 10, the new moon will arrive in your opposite sign of Pisces, 20 degrees, emphasizing the same partnership theme I mentioned earlier. Again, Jupiter and Uranus will be active and in touch with the Sun and new moon and will increase your motivation to join forces with another person or to make more of an ongoing relationship in love or business. If you have been dating a long time, a proposal may surface, and if you’re ready to commit, you will become engaged or married. The huge accent on travel could mean that a breathtaking honeymoon could be imminent and on the horizon.</p>
<p>If you are already wed, Saturn’s presence in this same area of your chart suggests that you may have hit a speed bump in your relationship. Saturn is testing the strength of your relationship and will continue to examine your close love or business alliance until February 2026.</p>
<blockquote><p>Spin your compass, dear Virgo, and decide where to go. You are under glittering aspects between now and the end of May.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Many people sail through Saturn’s tests because they have strong relationships. If you feel you are not in sync with your partner, it looks like you both could use a little time away to recharge and refresh your relationship. Sometimes the only way to separate from the heavy weight of life’s daily cares is to go to a new setting for a week or two. It is amazing how difficult life can be when there is a lack of fun. It would be quite a surprisingly special trip, possibly one that comes along only once in a lifetime. Spin your compass, dear Virgo, and decide where to go. You are under glittering aspects between now and the end of May.</p>
<p>On another topic, and coming back to Jupiter and Uranus, next month these two planets will make a historic alignment. It will happen on April 20 and then not again for years, not until September 2037, and by then both planets will be in a different sign and house—Cancer.</p>
<p>These two heavy-duty planets will meet in Taurus next month in your ninth house of international relationships and travel, so it appears you will have quite an impetus to simply spontaneously pack and go. Or you may get sudden good news from a client based in a foreign country. This is a joyous aspect happening in your ninth house of travel at 22 degrees, giving a double dip of pleasure and luck to those born September 14, plus or minus two days.</p>
<p>You may not have to wait until April 20 to see evidence of this luck, however, no matter when your birthday happens to be. These two planets are already orbiting close to each other because they move so slowly. (They’ll be within 4 degrees of each other by the end of March.)</p>

        <p>Other possible benefits from this Jupiter-Uranus alignment include getting an exciting assignment in broadcasting, publishing, or the digital world. If you are interested in going back to college or graduate school for a degree, or if you applied to the institution of your choice, you may get financial aid or a scholarship. If you are young, you may now get an invitation to go to your first-choice college. In another instance, a legal matter may go in your favor. Every Virgo will enjoy the message of Jupiter and Uranus in any of the ways it could translate. If your birthday falls within two days of September 14 you will see that, indeed, this aspect is extraordinary.</p>
<p>We are coming to two eclipses, of which the first one, coming at the end of this month on March 25, will be in Libra, 5 degrees, and will affect your salary, earned income, and possessions. The second one, due next month on April 8, will be a new moon total eclipse of the Sun in Aries, 19 degrees. It will also focus on money, but it will light your eighth house of other people’s money, affecting loans, commissions, legal settlements, and so forth. Both eclipses are remarkably friendly, and yes, there is a such thing as a positive, uplifting eclipse. We will soon have two!</p>
<p>The April 8 eclipse will be visible over the contiguous United States, and if you google the April 8 path of totality, you will see that NASA has a great site with a map and the times each city will go dark. Many people are making hotel reservations along the path of totality so that they will be able to see the eclipse. It is something to experience.</p>
<p>The sky goes dark as night in the middle of the day. Animals become anxious and make all kinds of sounds, realizing something has changed that is not usual in their environment. New York City is not in the path of totality, so where I live, we will only see a 92% solar eclipse. You will be hearing and reading about it all over the news, on TV, newspapers, podcasts, and the Internet. Get your special paper glasses to view the eclipse. They are for sale on Amazon.</p>

        <p>Now let’s look at the full moon lunar eclipse that will be happening this month on March 25 (I will discuss the April 8 eclipse in my April report to you).</p>
<p>An eclipse signifies change and will often ask you to give up one situation for another. In that respect, the situation or the relationship is “eclipsed out”—taken away—to make room for the new, which usually follows within a few weeks. In your case, you may change jobs for a better paying one in another company. If you are self-employed, a new, lucrative client may contact you, asking if you can work together. The eclipse will be in Libra, which is what astrologers call a double-bodied sign (because of the two sides of the scale—Libra is known for seeing both sides of a discussion or debate), so you may be working with a partner in a joint venture, or you may have two offers, two clients, or two opportunities.</p>
<p>Venus will be the most important planet at the March 25 eclipse, so we have to look at the condition of Venus. Happily, Venus will receive golden vibrations from Jupiter and Uranus—again from their perch in your ninth houses of foreign people and places, travel, the media, legal matters, and also institutions of higher education. You may win a lawsuit or get a scholarship or financial aid to allow you to get your advanced degree.</p>
<p>Another bonus—Pluto, a heavy-duty financial planet that is newly minted in Aquarius, is in your sixth house of work-a-day assignments and will be beautifully oriented toward the full moon eclipse on March 25, so it appears a job you are finishing up (or starting, if you hear of it now) will pay exceedingly well. It looks like your reputation precedes you, dear Virgo.</p>

        <p>Neptune might be problematic at both the full moon March 25 eclipse and also earlier at the new moon March 10 (not an eclipse) as Neptune will have his fingerprints all over both lunations.</p>
<p>Neptune has two sides to his influence. On one hand, Neptune’s presence could suggest that you will be tapped for your artistic talents or stylish taste to work on a creative project. Neptune’s downside, however, tends to place a veil over reality, making everything look prettier and better than it is by covering up certain aspects of the deal that could work against you.</p>
<p>It will be important to check out the person and the company offering you the job or venture. Do not make assumptions to fill in the empty, blank spots when you don’t have all the facts. We all do this unconsciously if we are excited about a new enterprise, but with Neptune so active in March, and Mercury retrograde nipping at his heels (to start April 1), you need to be cautious. Don’t get me wrong—this situation does look to be a good one, but I need you to do routine background checks and ask many questions. I cannot see everything in your chart from where I sit, and I don’t want elements of the deal to bite you later.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Your relationship with a close, committed partner in love (such your spouse) or business (such as a collaborator or expert you hire) has not always been easy, but in the first half of March, you will find the relationship to feel better and possibly proceed more smoothly. If you are looking for a way to bond closer in a romantic relationship, consider taking a foreign trip together to provide a touch of adventure and wonder this month—that would be the right idea. In business, instead of thinking local, think global, because your ninth house of foreign people, places, and overseas markets is glowing brightly all month and will continue to do so for almost three months, until May 25.</p>

        <p>If you cannot travel internationally in March, April, or May (which would be ideal), then in your own city, indulge in foreign cultures. Treat yourself to tickets to a ballet troupe from a visiting foreign country, or dine in a restaurant devoted to an international cuisine that you’d like to try. Visit a major art exhibit from another time and place. You will feel enormously refreshed after you do.</p>
<p>It is also possible you will be working with a company that has its headquarters very far from home. If so, this venture should be fortunate for you—it would pay you well and allow you to learn from the work you do.</p>
<p>At work, things should be going well, for you have both Venus and Mars in your sixth house of daily assignments. Venus loves to be with Mars—astrologically, when they orbit together (which is rare), these planets spread joy and happiness. Venus and Mars together provide a perfect environment for workers to get along well with each other. You should find team members and subordinates unusually cheerful and eager to work together to make the project a success. I know the cheerfulness of the team might make you feel as though you’ve fallen into a slightly strange parallel universe—this does not happen often! Indeed, things will be clicking along like clockwork, so don’t question it. Enjoy it!</p>
<p>By the time you get to the full moon eclipse in Libra on March 25, you will turn your attention to your own finances. Eclipses tend to bring dramatic, memorable events, so you may get a new job that pays you a more handsome salary. This is because powerhouse Pluto will be in direct touch with the full moon lunar eclipse and also to the Sun in the friendliest way possible. If you are self-employed, you may get a prestigious new client and settle on a generous fee you will be paid. One way or another, more money is heading your way.</p>

        <p>It is also possible that you will write a check for something quite expensive within five days of the eclipse March 25. For example, you may buy a house or car, send in a large tuition payment, or take a whirlwind foreign trip with a friend or spouse.</p>
<p>Alternatively, at the full moon eclipse in Libra, you may decide to combine funds with another person—a business partner or spouse—on a new enterprise you are starting now. Saturn will be close to Venus, suggesting you will take this step (whatever you choose to do) seriously and may already have done a lot of thinking, deliberation, negotiation, and research before getting to this point. As full moon lunar eclipses go, this eclipse appears to be working out for your interests.</p>
<p>While this eclipse is an encouraging one, you will need to take one point into consideration. Neptune will be quite prominent in the March 25 lunar eclipse (and also at the new moon March 10), so you do have to diligently research all aspects of the offer you are considering. Read up on the people offering you the job, and also ask many questions. Avoid making any assumptions with foggy Neptune so active, and at the same time, with Mercury retrograde on the way April 1 to April 25—you can’t be too careful.</p>
<p>Neptune’s presence might indicate the project will tap your creative and artistic side, which would be a plus. Do your research, and take your time before accepting the offer—you will be glad you did.</p>
