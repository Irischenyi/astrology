        <p>You have a sterling month ahead, one with variety and opportunities galore. It’s rare to see a month that is near-perfect for you to enjoy—this is it.</p>
<p>Like Gemini and Cancer, as a Leo, all of your transiting planets are above the horizon of your chart, indicating that for most of the month, you will be out in public and more concerned with your career and other activities that involve other people.</p>
<p>Your career is blossoming like a huge hibiscus flower in the sunshine. Jupiter, the good fortune planet that brings growth, happiness, and opportunities, is orbiting close to Uranus, the planet of sudden surprises, and they are both in Taurus, your tenth professional house of honors, awards, and achievement. Jupiter and Uranus will make a historic alignment on April 20 in this same career house and bring some exciting news. You may not even have to wait that long because these two planets are already close. In March get ready for a lucky professional breakthrough that will send your spirits soaring.</p>
<p>You will have Jupiter, the great benefic planet, in Taurus, your house of career, until May 25 of this year.(This trend started in May 2023, and Jupiter won’t be back here until April 2035, more than a decade from now.) Work extra hard while Jupiter is in Taurus, and then from June 2024 onward, you can socialize to your heart’s content. For now, you have a rare competitive edge, where barriers will collapse and allow you to score the victories you deserve.</p>

        <p>Next month Mercury will retrograde from April 1 to April 25, so accomplish as much as you can now because in the last third of March you will begin to feel the slowdown that Mercury retrograde brings. Sign contracts in early March, and if you need an electronic product, such as a smartphone, laptop, new TV, or even a car, you would be wise to buy it (or any other electronics) in the first part of March. You would need to stay as far away from the start of Mercury retrograde—April 1—as possible.</p>
<p>Even with Mercury due to retrograde next month, April will still offer you a number of lovely days that you’ll be able to use to score a breakthrough—in addition to your most magnificent day on April 20. As said earlier, this is when Jupiter will conjoin Uranus, giving you a major boost for your career and making you very happy.</p>
<p>In the early part of this month, mark down March 1 when Jupiter will be in perfect angle to the Sun. The Sun is your ruling star, so while everyone will love this day, you will love it more and benefit from it more than most. This day would be superb for a confidential meeting with a VIP to discuss money or to pitch a client ornegotiate a raise or sale.</p>

        <p>I also love March 9 when Uranus will contact the Sun—all kinds of unexpected things could happen on this day, making you luckier than a little leprechaun. Your mind will be moving at the speed of light, and your ideas will easily spill forth like a plethora of shimmering diamonds falling from the top of your head. You need to test yourself to see your talent for developing ideas—so sit quietly and work on a specific problem that you want to solve.</p>
<p>It’s been said that creativity wells up within each of us every 90 minutes, but none of us know where within that cycle we are entering. For this reason, you need to keep working on generating ideas for at least 90 minutes—your creativity may show up instantly, in the middle of your session (and keep on going), or it might surface at the end of the 90-minute stretch. It will be exciting when you see this materialize. I’ve tried it—it works.</p>
<p>Let’s now look at the new moon on March 10 in Pisces, 20 degrees. Saturn will follow this new moon and the Sun, and you clearly want to make more money. If you are on commission, you may feel your quota is too high and unrealistic and should be adjusted. The house where this new moon will appear is your eighth house, which rules commissions, so this would be the time to discuss an adjustment. You also have thedirect, strong support of both Jupiter and Uranus. You will likely have a list of accomplishments to point to during your discussion, so your timing is fantastic.</p>
<p>You may have just paid your taxes, or will soon, and it looks like you might owe some due to your rising status in your industry—let this be extra motivation for you to speak up and see if you can increase your income. Neptune is conjunct the Sun, so it appears your job is creative and that you are prized for the taste, stylishness, freshness, and imagination you can bring to the table.</p>

        <p>Pluto is also getting into the act and will send a powerful beam to Mercury, the planet that rules your other financial sector (second house), indicating you can receive the raise you want.</p>
<p>Romantically, your relationship with your spouse or steady, serious partner appears to be smooth and happy. As a testament to this, you have Mars and Venus, the two lovebird planets, both in the good-for-you-sign of Aquarius, your commitment/marriage house. Your partner has noticed how hard you work and also feels you should be making more money, considering the effort you are putting in at your job. As you see, you have the impetus to speak up.</p>
<p>A new moon is powerful for the weeks and months after it appears—for almost six months—but it’s strongest in the first seven to 10 days after it occurs. This month’s new moon is on March 10—so there is no time like the present.</p>
<p>This month holds the first of two eclipses, and the first one will appear on March 25 in Libra at 5 degrees, your third house of contractual agreements. You may receive papers to sign, and if so, you would be wise to consult with a lawyer first. Neptune will oppose this full moon eclipse and conjoin the Sun, adding fog and making it impossible to see reality clearly. Before you put your signature on the dotted line, you need the objective opinion of your lawyer. March 25 is also very close to the onset of Mercury retrograde, and as I wrote earlier, you will always feel Mercury retrograde as you near its onset (April 1).</p>

        <p>Your third house rules more than agreements, though—it also rules short-distance travel. You may be taking off for a drive or short plane trip, so again, do your homework before you go. Double-check that you have the proper address in case the person has moved, and make sure your car is in good working order. If you are flying to your destination, call the morning of your trip to be certain your flight is on time. If you are traveling to see a client, be organized and buttoned up.</p>
<p>Be optimistic about the possible results of your meeting—you have Pluto helping you during this full moon eclipse.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>As you begin March, you will be concentrating on organizing or negotiating one or more financial matters. The new moon will appear on March 10 in Pisces, an area of your chart that deals with other people’s money, which includes loans and mortgages, credit, credit card bills, insurance payouts, inheritance, prize winnings, commissions, royalties, severance packages, and so on. You may be determined to polish off anyoutstanding accounts and also gather your receipts for your accountant to prepare your taxes.</p>
<p>After this you can breathe freely, confident you have taken care of all your financial obligations. Saturn is orbiting this same area of your chart, lending diligence to all you do. In the process, you could bolster your credit rating, which would allow you access to a more attractive interest rate if you were to buy a house, car, or make any other expensive purchase.</p>

        <p>Your career is currently receiving the finest planetary support that you could ever wish to see. This comes thanks to Jupiter, the planet of good fortune, and Uranus, the planet of surprise—Uranus will also help you develop your own visionary creativity to generate innovative breakthroughs.</p>
<p>With your eighth house of finances lit up and working with these aspects (until May 25), you can make a name for yourself and earn the compensation that is commensurate with your rising status. You may also be negotiating a professional fee, bonus, commission, royalty structure, or a benefits package. Alternatively(although, admittedly, a little less likely), you might be ready to buy or sell property, and you’d see an unexpected twist in the talks you’re having that benefits you. Or you may be applying for a mortgage or financial aid for college.</p>
<p>If you are working on finding a fair division of property with a soon-to-be-ex-partner at the end of a marriage or business, as long as you open talks on March 10 and continue the conversation in the days and weeks that follow, your chance of having a successful negotiation is excellent—so stay confident.</p>
<p>Your collaborations and interactions with others should go smoothly, and this also includes your relationship with your romantic partner (your spouse or the person you are dating seriously), assuming you are not in the process of divorcing. (This isn’t representative of most Leos—Leos who are divorcing now tend to be the outliers these days.) You will also have a harmonious relationship with your committed business alliances.</p>

        <p>In early March you have both Venus and Mars in Aquarius, the area of your chart that rules serious, committed relationships (a holdover from last month), so even if you are agreeing to part ways, this relationship is likely to stay civil and polite. Venus and Mars go together like cups and saucers. These planets love to be together but can rarely conjoin because of their different orbits—usually they are given far-flung assignments in our solar system, so all they can do is wave to one another as they gaze across the star-studded sky. Venus and Mars spread charm, warmth, and ease throughout all of your relationships, so you should find you will make excellent progress at work and in your personal life.</p>
<p>A full moon lunar eclipse will occur this month in Libra on March 25, so you may be ready to conclude talks and make a solid commitment to a deal by signing a contract, but you need to slow down. It is never wise tosign papers directly on an eclipse, and this is additionally applicable at this time because Neptune is in opposition to this full moon, adding confusion. You would do best to hire a lawyer if you have any serious commitments to make because you would need to be absolutely sure you have all the necessary facts. Don’t try to save money by not hiring a lawyer—the legal advice you receive now will likely prevent future problems.</p>
<p>This is not to say that this eclipse is suggesting this deal is bad. Just the opposite, this agreement could become a brilliant jewel in your crown, but you would have to look at the fine print and make adjustments first. In other words, the outcome will be predicated on your ability to separate fact from fiction—to distinguish what “is” from what you wish and imagine things it to be. Stay practical and realistic, dear Leo.</p>

        <p>It is also possible that you will plan a short trip within five days of the March 25 eclipse, and this appears to be for a business purpose, such as to finalize a financial deal. Neptune’s influence would affect you here too, so you would be wise to proceed slowly—check that the address of your destination is correct. If you are arriving late, make sure your hotel will keep your booking.</p>
<p>If your birthday falls on July 27, you will be the most likely to feel the positive effects of the March 25 eclipse.The same is true if you have Leo rising at 5 degrees or a planet in your natal chart (or natal moon) at 5 degrees of Leo, Aries, Sagittarius, Gemini, Libra, or Aquarius, plus or minus five degrees.</p>
<p>Don’t forget, you have Pluto helping you every inch of the way at this eclipse.</p>
