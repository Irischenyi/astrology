        <p>It is a glorious time to be a Taurus, as many planets are working in your favor. Let’s start with your career—you seem to be doing everything right professionally, for you are hosting Venus in the highest sector of your chart, your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement, indicating you are popular with VIPs, peers, and subordinates alike.</p>
<p>Venus is your ruling planet, and therefore, Venus’ position is important. Venus shows that in your work, you are committed to doing your job thoroughly and are eager to protect and promote your reputation for excellence. There are no problems here—you are in a period where others in your industry who learn about you will admire your performance and your finely honed work ethic.</p>
<p>On another topic, joyously, you still have Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, in Taurus. This is a place Jupiter entered last year, in May 2023. This is a magnificent privilege, as Jupiter will continue to put you in the right place at the right time and offer you a number of lucky breaks. Every Taurus will partake of this fortunate period, and this month those born within five days, plus or minus, of May 12 will soon be treated with a double dip of pleasure.</p>
<p>Jupiter took 12 years to journey around the Sun to get to your Taurus constellation, so you would be wise to make the most of this trend. Uranus, the planet of all things sudden and unexpected, is traveling with Jupiter and will make a historic conjunction next month on April 20—these two planets are already close enough in March to feel this wonderful aspect. Once they peak in closeness in April, they will not meet again in conjunction until September 2037, but they will not meet in Taurus—their meeting will be in Cancer (good but not quite a special as this year’s conjunction).</p>

        <p>Jupiter conjunct Uranus in Taurus brings hope and optimism, for one or more happy surprises will likely come to you out of left field. When Venus enters compatible Pisces on March 11 to stay until April 4, you will have a superb chance to meet your one truelove (or to bond closer to the love you have already found). Venus expresses her most loving side when in Pisces (Venus is exalted in Pisces), blending perfectly with your earth sign element.</p>
<p>Jupiter in Taurus will connect with the Sun to give you a lovely greeting on March 1—a perfect day for luck in an action you hope to take.</p>
<p>Uranus’ connection to Mercury will be helpful on March 4 and keep you motivated by sending you happy news you won’t see coming but will be thrilled with when it arrives.</p>
<p>A friend appears to be the focus at the new moon on March 10 in Pisces at 20 degrees. The Sun and new moon will be in in your eleventh house of social activity, and Saturn will orbit close to the Sun. This was a situation you first saw last month over February 24 when Saturn was already close to the Sun and opposed the full moon in Virgo. Someone near was either going through a hard patch, or you were deciding on how you felt about a current romantic relationship. Alternatively, you may have been concentrating on how best to help one of your children.</p>
<blockquote><p>At work, VIPs, peers, and subordinates are all drawn to you magnetically in the hopes that some of your sparkle will fall onto them.</p></blockquote>

        <p>This month, you may be concerned over the welfare of a friend and be moved to help. For example, you might accompany her to the doctor for moral support, volunteer to help her young children with their homework for an hour each evening, or step in by cooking meals for her family if she is not up to doing that herself.</p>
<p>New moons open a portal for weeks and months that accents the activities in the house the new moon appears. If you volunteer to help, be prepared to provide assistance over a number of weeks—your friend will be very grateful if you stay steadfast in your commitment to her.</p>
<p>The eleventh house, where this new moon is appearing in your chart on March 10, also rules charities, community activities, and humanitarian and environmental affairs. So instead, you may take a leadership position in a group you belong to so that you can help make the world a better place. You might, for example take on the presidency or become the chairperson of an important committee dealing with fundraising or the media. At the new moon in Pisces, you will also have the Sun, Neptune, and Saturn all in Pisces, and each will stimulate your feelings of compassion.</p>
<p>While this is going on, you may find ways to help a parent, child, or other family member. If that does not resonate, you may be thinking your home feels too small and you need to move, or you need to make more space by packing things up to give away. There was an element to recent lunations that touched on your home living experience as well as your relationship to family.</p>

        <p>When it comes to romance, as a result of the strong full moon in Virgo last month on February 24, you may have been deciding about a person you have been dating. If you have tried to improve your relationship over weeks, or even months, to no avail, you may have recently decided to leave. You have such good aspects that come by only rarely, so you would be right to leave. You still are in a great cycle to meet many interesting, supportive people—one may be the perfect partner for you.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to this month’s full moon lunar eclipse that will arrive March 25 in Libra and light your sixth house of work assignments, your health, and also pets. A full moon lunar eclipse like this one will bring you closure or a finish to a situation.</p>
<p>In the matter of health, you may get a test result that shows you should follow up with your doctor. The problem with this particular eclipse is that it will appear near Neptune, which will veil reality, so it will be hard to get facts and, perhaps in this case, a proper diagnosis. If a test result seems odd to you, there is no harm in asking that the test be repeated.</p>
<p>The wonderful part about this eclipse is that Pluto will be perfectly “trine” (a heavenly aspect) to the full moon eclipse. Pluto will be on hand to offer you awesome regenerative powers—the kind that would surprise your doctor. The first house of the horoscope rules vitality, but the sixth house, where (in your chart) the Libra full moon lunar eclipse will occur on March 25, covers the preventative measures that you take to get well and stay well. If you feel that anything doesn’t feel right, see a doctor to nip it in the bud. You have Pluto to help you.</p>

        <p>As said before, pets fall into this house—specifically, small domestic animals—so if your little dog or cat seems to be acting out of sorts, of course you will want to see the veterinarian. You will want to do all you can to bring comfort to your furry little animal.</p>
<p>The sixth house also rules work-a-day projects. (It does not cover promotions or reputation—that would be your tenth house.) I had a friend who always managed to change jobs when there was new moon in her sixth house. She was wondering why all her moves were lateral, why she never seemed to advance to a higher level. I sat down with her, and we listed the dates she took her new jobs over the past five years. She worked as a project manager, and looking at the lists of dates, we could see she always accepted her new job on a sixth house new or full moon. I showed her that her timing was off—she was, unfortunately, switching one job for another but always at the same level. I showed her when she would have a tenth house new moon, and then her entire career changed and surged upward.</p>
<p>For you, a promotion would come at a new moon in Aquarius, which typically falls at the end of January or in the first three weeks of February. You also might have luck at the full moon in Aquarius at the end of July or in the first three weeks of August.</p>
<p>Check my calendar for the new and full moons in Aquarius. On my calendar, which I write and sell on my Astrologyzone.com site, I give you the place the lunations occur—the sign and degree—and I give you a summary of how that new and full moon will behave in simple English, no astro-babble.</p>
<p>I don’t know your rising sign from where I sit, but if you can find your time of birth, you can run your chart at no cost on my site, and you will get a full interpretation. Once you know the sign on the mid-heaven (cusp of your tenth house), you can add extra full and new moons in the year that could be perfect for career advancement. (If you were born at dawn, you have the same rising sign as your Sun sign.)</p>

        <p>There is more to say about the eclipse in Libra on March 25—it will put Venus in charge, so we have to examine the condition of Venus at the time of the eclipse. (Venus is also Taurus’ ruler, giving Venus an extra layer of importance to you.)</p>
<p>At the time of the eclipse, Venus will be in Pisces, 16 degrees, in ideal conversation with Jupiter in Taurus, also at 16 degrees. Wow—a perfect sextile. This indicates an opportunity will develop. Whatever is coming to a crest at this full moon certainly seems to benefit you in a big way. Saturn will be orbiting close to Venus at the time of the eclipse, showing that you have a serious attitude about your work and that you will be watching every detail. Good!</p>
<p>At the time of the eclipse, you may see a trusted subordinate announce her departure (an eclipse of the moon points to a female). The eclipse sometimes “eclipses out” a person from your environment, and in this case, that would be a member of your staff. If you do lose a worker, that can be stressful I know, but you will find someone even better suited to the job, as this positive eclipse is working its magic for you.</p>
<p>Neptune will be near the Sun and partnering with the moon, so this project that is finishing up could be a creative assignment. At this full moon, you may get news of more fascinating work coming down the pike, news that you would welcome.</p>

        <span class="auther-name">by Susan Miller</span>
        <p>While the eclipse won’t likely change your status within your company or industry, it will likely bring a project to conclusion. The fact that that you are wrapping up a project on an eclipse suggests there’s something special about it. Also—and this is important—you have Pluto, newly in Aquarius, perched in your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement. The eclipse in Libra will be in perfect trine to Pluto on March 24 (a gorgeous, best-you-can-get aspect). This tells me that your project is likely to be a jewel in your crown for powerful people will notice your talent and good work and put you in line for a bigger role when promotions are given out.</p>
<p>Overall, when the eclipse arrives, there is usually a “eureka!” factor—the eclipse brings you one of the missing pieces of information that you needed to fully understand a situation. When it comes, the entire complexion of the situation changes and is illuminated.</p>
<p>You have a busy month, but April will have a slower pace. Mercury will be retrograde April 1 to April 25, so if you need a new computer, smart phone, or even a car, buy them in the first half of March, as you will start to feel the slowdown of Mercury by the last third of March. Sign a contract in the first week of March if possible—it’s a great time to do so.</p>
<p>Despite Mercury retrograde, you will have quite a number of happy days in April. While April won’t be favorable for buying electronics or signing important papers, it will bring opportunity and happy experiences in your birthday month. You will see! I promise!</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You are still very much enjoying your sparkling Emerald Year with Jupiter, the good fortune planet, coaxing you to think big. Wishes can come true, dear Taurus, because if you can imagine it, you can make it happen. You waited 12 years to have Jupiter in Taurus, a privilege that started last year on May 10, 2023, and is set to continue until May 25 of this year, 2024. If there is anything you would like to accomplish, you still have three months to do so. You can pitch and land a prestigious new client, fall in love (thanks to a friend’s introduction), or manage to buy the house of your dreams. These are a few examples, but you can add others. Decide on your number one dream, and work on it while you have Jupiter’s favor and competitive edge.</p>
<p>You have never been one to shirk hard work, for as a Taurus, you are known to display a consistent, determined effort. Next month on April 20, Jupiter, the good fortune planet, will conjoin Uranus, the planet of surprise, in Taurus, a wonderful event. These two planets, when in conjunction, are known to bring unexpected joy and possible financial reward, too.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that luck seems to be on your side now, for both planets—Jupiter and Uranus—are already close enough to deliver surprise, good news in March, and it only gets better in April.</p>
<p>At work, you are popular with VIPs, peers, and subordinates alike. You seem to be emitting a certain kind of magic—exhibiting a wide range of imagination and creativity—in the way you approach your work. Others are drawn to you magnetically in the hopes that some of your sparkle will fall onto them. Pluto recently moved into your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement, so voice your ideas—don’t hide them—for you have a rare opportunity from now and extending for 20 years to make quite a name for yourself.</p>

        <p>The new moon on March 10 will turn your thoughts to a friend, who you hope to help in an appreciable way. It appears your friend needs your support, and you will be willing to offer a helping hand.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you might decide to volunteer for a charity, community effort, or a humanitarian event to raise awareness and funding for a cause you believe in. Saturn will be close to the new moon March 10, so if you do offer help to a friend or make a commitment to a cause, you will likely remain quite a long time to offer support and comfort. Neptune, the planet of compassion, will also orbit close to the Sun and new moon and add an emotional element to the situation that may pluck at your heartstrings, the reason you will feel propelled to act. You have a chance to be a force of change if you decide to roll up your sleeves and offer assistance now.</p>
<p>The March 25 full moon eclipse in Libra will arrive in your work-a-day sector, so it appears an assignment you’ve been working on is finishing up and has importance for the future. Pay attention to all elements of this project, including the person who chooses you for it, for this assignment seems to have legs that will take you to more interesting work—work with greater complexity and a chance to imprint your own style and taste on those projects. With Pluto so favorable, your work is being noticed by VIPs at the top and can easily prove you are a star to watch and to reward later in the year.</p>
<p>Also, at the time near the eclipse March 25, watch your health, as you may be putting out a lot of energy and shortcutting sleep or nutrition, thereby lowering your immunity. The sixth house, where the eclipse will appear in your chart, also rules, aside from work and health, the solutions, habits, and actions you take to help keep your mind and body stay strong. Pace yourself and stop occasionally to treat yourself to tender loving care.</p>
<p>Once Venus, your ruler, moves into highly compatible Pisces on March 11 to stay until April 4, your social life will move into high gear. Although you will be working hard, and perhaps helping a friend or charity, you will have time to experience several enchanting, and possibly romantic, moments during the month.</p>
