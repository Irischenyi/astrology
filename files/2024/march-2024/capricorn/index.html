        <p>You will always look for ways to get ahead in business as well as in your personal life. This month you may focus on the way you communicate to others, sharpening your skills and finding ways you can strengthen your methods of negotiation. Planets stacking up in your third house suggest your timing is spot on, so give this effort all you’ve got. You may take a class or stock up with books by experts, especially in negotiation.</p>
<p>Capricorn is a leadership-oriented cardinal sign (along with Aries, Cancer, Libra), and you are considered a mover and shaker of the zodiac. Every sign has a ruling planet—yours is Saturn, so the place and sign where Saturn is traveling will always matter to you quite a bit. Being ruled by Saturn makes you like structure, and you admire people who have strong self-discipline like you. You know how to manage your time so that it can yield the highest level of productivity. Indeed, you need to see progress in all that you do.</p>
<p>Saturn moved into Pisces in March 2023, and that has given you new insights to the way you perceive and navigate the world around you. You are taking on some of the wisdom of Pisces. Pisces is more intuitive than you, but now you are finding value in listening to your hunches. Just a few years ago, that thought would have horrified you—you like basing all your decisions on hard facts, but you are beginning to see that facts can be tainted by the way they are drawn up. As one example, a poll can be skewed by the way the pollster frames the question—and by the questions that were not asked.</p>
<p>Pisces is flexible, adaptable, and creative, always thinking outside the box, and you are now seeing there is value to that kind of thinking, too. You have had Saturn here for a full year, so this is no fleeting influence. Saturn will remain in Pisces until February 2026. The Pisces gifts you are receiving will add depth and range to your personality, and add two of this sign’s greatest gifts—inspiration and compassion.</p>

        <p>Many Capricorns are artistic, especially in music, illustration, writing, comedy, and poetry, and if you have one of these talents, under Saturn’s influence, with effort, you can see your artistic expressions blossom. March is a special month because the new moon will occur in your third house, which is essentially a communication hub that encourages skills in writing, speaking, coding, editing, translating, negotiating, and research. If you have a book or screenplay inside you, it’s time to roll up your sleeves and get started. Do so just after the new moon on March 10.</p>
<p>You might launch a new advertising or social media campaign that hits the mark or a publicity project that produces blockbuster results. You may introduce a highly popular app to the market or a new digital game that takes off. You may venture into A.I. and find new ways to harness it in a way that makes people flock to find out more.</p>
<p>Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, and Uranus, the planet of surprise, will both be on their best behavior in March and send glittering vibrations to the new moon in Pisces on March 10. This is no small advantage! Jupiter and Uranus both are in Taurus (a fellow earth sign like yours) in your creativity sector and can bring genius ideas and hefty profits to the work you are doing now.</p>

        <p>The new moon of March 10 in Pisces at 20 degrees could also bring a contract for you to sign. You are sharpening your communication and negotiation skills, so you have a good chance of settling an excellent deal. If your lawyer gives you the nod to sign, do so quickly—the earlier in the month you sign, the better, even prior to the new moon March 10.</p>
<p>I say to sign early in the month because there will be a problem with this new moon. Neptune will be conjunct the new moon and Sun, both in Pisces, and will throw a veil over both reality and all the information you are given to make the opportunity, or the person you would join, look more glowing and, perhaps, more profitable, than is likely. You must do your due diligence and check out the idea with experts and also conduct background checks on the person you are dealing with. I have a second reason I want you to hurry along with the contract and sign it early in the month.</p>
<p>Mercury will retrograde from April 1 to April 25, and you will not want to get tangled up in the confusing web of Mercury retrograde. You will begin to see the second thoughts (on either side) as early as March 20. Assumptions you are making may later prove to be false.</p>
<p>During Mercury retrograde (and roughly at least a week prior), avoid buying electronic products, including a TV or kitchen appliances, or anything that is expensive, like a piece of furniture, a mattress, a car, or jewelry, as some examples. Also important, do not sign contracts, leases, or close on a house—no paperwork at all—in April. The following month, May, is due to be the most gorgeous month of the year, absolutely chock full of diamond-like days that glow with opportunity, so if you can’t sign in early March, put off (if at all possible) signing papers, or purchasing major products, until May.</p>

        <p>If the idea is creative or artistic, Neptune may actually help you bring your work to a compelling level of artistic grace, but at the same time, there still is the coming difficulty with Mercury, too.</p>
<p>If you are starting a project, like writing a book or developing a digital game, and you know the person you are partnering with, you may be fine because you started your relationship a long time ago and are not “giving birth” to the partnership—in that case, Mercury retrograde won’t hurt you.</p>
<p>The danger only exists if you don’t know the person well or if you don’t fully understand the true terms and potential of the venture. The assumptions you make could come back to bite you because they were not based in reality. You are known to be a pillar of objectivity and productivity, which will help you now. You do have a number of outstanding planets at the March 10 new moon, so if you do your research, all may be fine. At any rate, with Neptune strong this month and Mercury retrograde nipping at your heels, don’t skip the step of hiring a lawyer. Having legal protection is always a good move.</p>
<p>The third house, which will be packed with lovely planets at the new moon March 10, also rules travel, usually short distance that you can easily get to within a day. You may be traveling for work more than usual to pitch clients or to settle deals in person, which is always a good idea. If you travel for fun, that also would be good, for Jupiter and Uranus are in your truelove sector (I referred to it earlier as the area of creativity, which this house also rules). March 9-10 would be lovely for a romantic getaway.</p>
<p>Your big moment of the month will come on March 25 at the full moon lunar eclipse in Libra, 5 degrees. This could be a sterling professional landmark moment when you are named to a high position in your industry. You may be given a promotion within five days of the eclipse. If you have been interviewing for the job of your dreams at another firm, that position will likely come through for you then. The story about your new appointment could be in the press, and congratulations from friends and colleagues will pour in.</p>

        <p>Eclipses bring moments we often long remember, so this eclipse could mark a very happy time for you. If you want to know more about eclipses, you can read about their nature and influence in my essay, “How to Deal with Eclipses.”</p>
<p>This piece also exists on the premium version of my app, Astrology Zone Horoscopes ($4.99 a month), available on the Apple App Store and Google Play.

<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>In March life could become near perfect, if it were not for the high spending you have had to do lately. Mars has been the culprit, but happily, Mars will move out of your second house of savings and spending on March 22. After that date, expenses should drop noticeably, and your finances will be easier to manage.</p>
<p>After the new moon arrives to bring in a new focus, March 10, you will travel more often to places that will be within 200 miles from home. You seem to have a goal to complete on these trips, so they might be work-related, you might negotiate a purchase or sale of property, or you might do something else.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, you may be pitching a client or negotiating an important deal and may feel that being present, in person, will facilitate progress. You may be right. Next month, Mercury will be retrograde from April 1 to April 25, so you would be wise to finish things up now rather than allow things to linger until next month. All actions taken this month will turn out to be easier, and you will be more productive now—you will see better progress this month than you will in April.</p>
<p>Having said that you will do well in March, you need to be aware that Neptune will conjoin the new moon on March 10, and that may cloud facts, tempting you to assume conditions and possible eventual rewards that are not in evidence. Any legal papers you need to sign must be seen by a lawyer ahead of time. This is no time to hope things will work out without her services, not with Neptune strong and Mercury about to create his usual mischief. The funds you spend to hire your lawyer will be well spent. If the situation is a creative, artistic project, you will be protected, as Neptune is considered the planet of the arts, but you still have Mercury so close to going out of commission—and Mercury rules all contracts.</p>
<p>You are likely to experience an exciting high point in your career at the full moon in Libra on March 25, to light the pinnacle in your chart, your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement. As a Capricorn, you are an ambitious sign, and seeing continual professional progress is important to you. This full moon will be a lunar eclipse, and an eclipse gives the full moon extra power and might, for eclipses tend to bring on dramatic life events that you would long remember. Venus, the planet that rules your profession, will, at the time, be conjunct your ruler Saturn, so if you accept the offer, you will realize the weight and seriousness of the role you would be taking on.</p>

        <p>You appear to be in a period of change, for the eclipses this year are cutting across your career and home sectors, so you may move house to accommodate a job shift. Alternatively, you may move house because you will experience a generous increase in income and can afford a sunny, spacious apartment or house that is positioned close to your workplace and relieve you from long commutes. Pluto will staunchly support this full moon eclipse, so be courageous when you are negotiating your salary—you are under favorable aspects to make a generous amount, reflecting appreciably more money,</p>
<p>Also, this month, your ruler Saturn will be in a very rare supportive aspect to Jupiter. The aspect was exact in June 2023, but because both planets are slow-moving, they will still be within the mathematical area of significance in March. This will help you restructure your finances, career, and care for your family—particularly for your children, if that’s a goal. Work with your financial advisor to make any adjustments you both agree would be wise to make, and do so now.</p>
<p>Will there be opportunities to enjoy romance, especially if you are single? A strong, quite enchanting trend is on the way for you in May, so for now, be patient. If you are out and about in May, you may be thrilled with all that the planets have planned for you.</p>
<p>If you are attached, you might want to plan something special and out of the ordinary together so you have something to look forward to in the lovely month of May.</p>
<p>You do have a moment this month, over the weekend of March 9-10 when a romantic getaway could prove to be heavenly, and the time away will only make you look forward to being with your partner even more in the future. The month of May will dazzle you.</p>
