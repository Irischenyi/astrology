        <p>March will be kind to you, for most of the planets will be supportive of all you need to do. You will likely travel, work on bringing in more income, see friends, have time for a spontaneous, quick romantic getaway, and possibly see a major change to either your home, other property you may own, want to sell, or rent, or make a decision involving a dear family member. For this, watch the time near March 25, which will bring a full moon lunar eclipse in Libra.</p>
<p>Eclipses come in pairs, and the second one will arrive April 8 as a new moon total eclipse of the Sun in Aries. It, too, will be very friendly and will be powerful enough to bring a massive opportunity and beneficial change to your standing in your firm and industry. You have a lot going on!</p>
<p>As you begin the month, you seem to have high expenses, but you also have a strong ability to bring in a generous income. Mars will still be in Aquarius in your eighth house of other people’s money, a holdover from last month when Mars first entered this part of your chart on February 13. Mars in that position would likely make you focus on loans, credit cards, taxes, and so forth, but you will also have Venus orbiting close to Mars, an indication that money is flowing into you, too—Mars will remain in Aquarius until March 22.</p>
<p>If you work in sales, you may be due for a large commission or bonus, or if you own a business (including an Airbnb), customers will be beating a path to your door. If you are in court or dividing assets in a divorce, your chances are superb for getting a generous settlement. If you are in college, you may get financial aid for your tuition. You may get an inheritance or win a charity raffle or money on a TV game show. If you sent in a claim to an insurance company, you may be approved a large sum. If you are doing your taxes, you may be surprised to see you owe less than you estimated or even that you are getting a tax refund.</p>

        <p>Although Mars will remain in your eighth house of other people’s money until March 22, your best financial luck will arrive in the first 10 days of the month.</p>
<p>Next month Mercury will retrograde from April 1 to April 25, so accomplish as much as you can now. Youcan begin to feel the slowdown that Mercury retrograde brings up to 10 days beforehand, so sign contractsin early March, and if you need an electronic product, such as a smartphone, laptop, new TV, or even a car,you would be wise to buy it (or any other electronics) in the first part of March.</p>
<p>Now let’s discuss the new moon in Pisces, 20 degrees, due March 10 in your ninth house. That new moon will bring an opportunity to travel overseas (or to a distant point), or you may be dealing with clients at a very far distance by phone or email. Perhaps the client’s headquarters are in a foreign country. It appears this new moon will affect your career. I say that because Saturn is following the Sun in a wide, yet significant, conjunction, suggesting you may have a goal to complete. You are being careful that your work is accurate, on time, and also reflects creative thinking.</p>

        <p>There is more good news. Uranus in your eleventh house of joy and happiness will be reaching out in a beneficial way to that new moon, March 10. That tells me you might take a spontaneous and rather quick trip. Jupiter, the good fortune planet, will also be in contact with the new moon, assuring you that you would have the element of luck on your side.</p>
<p>There is a chance, however, that you may be traveling for pure pleasure (not business), and I say that because Venus is in the very best sign—Pisces—for you to enjoy romance, for it is a fellow water element. If you can get away for “just us two” and have grandma take care of your children, this month would be a great time to spontaneously go for a quick long weekend—go to a place near water for best results.</p>
<p>Venus is considered exalted in Pisces—the very finest place for Venus to bring out your charm (and to allow you to easily, and naturally, express your deepest, warmest feelings of love to your partner). If you travel for personal pleasure, with Venus, Jupiter, and Uranus all being supportive, you could easily enjoy a touch of luxury.</p>
<p>Neptune is conjunct the Sun in Pisces, so you’ll apply the benefits of this new moon to your work. Don’t be shy. You will be encouraged to offer imaginative, original ideas to your client, and this would be true no matter what your title happens to be.</p>

        <p>This new moon in Pisces of March 10 has other benefits for you, depending on your priorities this month. This new moon can help you get into the college of your choice or do well with your studies if you are enrolled in an institution of higher learning. It can help you negotiate for a good financial aid package, if you qualify, so by all means, send in an application. It can help you successfully start a legal case in the courts or do profitable import-export work, as some examples. The publishing and broadcasting industries shine for you, too.</p>
<p>All Cancers will notice the effects of this new moon, and the ones who will benefit the most are those whose birthday falls on July 12, plus or minus five days, or have Cancer rising at 20 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. If you have a natal planet or your natal moon at 20 degrees (plus or minus five degrees) of Pisces, Scorpio, Cancer, Taurus, Virgo, or Capricorn, you, too, will benefit.</p>
<p>If you don’t know your rising sign, you can do your birth chart on my website. (Use your computer to do this rather than your smartphone browser so you can easily print out the results.) You will get all the degrees present in your chart, which are so necessary in astrology—and the chart is free.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to the full moon eclipse that is due March 25 in Libra, 5 degrees, that will light your fourth house of home and family. (Eclipses come in pairs, two weeks apart. Next month we have a major new moon total eclipse of the Sun in Aries on April 8, centering on your career—it’s due to be exciting and positive.)</p>

        <p>This month, it looks like you will be making a decision about your living quarters or a family member—a child or a parent, for example—who you have been trying to help. Full moon eclipses are always important for they have the strength of three full moons rolled into one. Eclipses bring memorable events you may long remember in the months and years ahead.</p>
<p>Changes you are attempting to make in the home can be expensive, such as trying to help a family member financially or emotionally and to care for their well-being. It is also expensive to make home improvements, move house, or make changes in other property you may own, want to buy, sell, or rent. This eclipse will bring closure and a final decision.</p>
<p>You will have no worries, though, for with Pluto in perfect attitude to this full moon, it appears you will have all the money you will need to press forward. The money may come to you through a home improvement loan or mortgage, a gift from other family members, from a government social program, or from your own savings, investments, commissions, or royalties or a cash advance.</p>
<p>This eclipse in Libra will put Venus in charge of how things will play out, and remarkably, Venus will be in supreme condition thanks to a perfect, sparkling beam Venus will receive from good-fortune Jupiter and surprise planet Uranus, both situated in your eleventh house of hopes and wishes. You could not wish for better aspects. If you are selling property, you should do well, too. Jupiter and Uranus will be supportive of Saturn, suggesting you will be happy with your actions, and your decisions will stay in place a long time.</p>

        <p>Neptune will conjunct the Sun and new moon on March 10 and oppose the full moon on March 25, so it will be important that you thoroughly investigate any venture you enter into and also know all you can about the person or people who will be offering you the opportunity.</p>
<p>If you are seriously dating, be sure you know the person quite well for Neptune will tempt you to assign all kinds of glowing qualities to your sweetheart simply based on your assumptions. Those assumptions could seem so logical to you at the time, but if they are not based on facts, they could hurt you later. Everything may be fine—but you need to find out for sure.</p>

<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>With planets crowded in your ninth house, your desire to travel far and wide will grow. It is not clear if you will be jetting out of town for business or for the pleasure of being in a new setting. Either way, the planets will be so friendly, it appears almost certain that you will enjoy your time away.</p>
<p>You will quickly realize you must be organized to make the most of any business travel you plan to take due to Saturn’s presence. If you have everything together, Jupiter, the planet of good fortune, will help you see good profit from your trip, and with Uranus exceedingly friendly too, an unexpected twist to talks at your destination could turn out to benefit you.</p>

        <p>Mercury will retrograde next month from April 1 to April 25, so if you need to purchase any electronics or sign any papers, do so as early this month as possible.</p>
<p>Almost all month, until March 22, you seem to be concerned about money and the need to bring in more income. Mars rules your natural solar tenth house of career advancement and is currently in Aquarius in your eighth house of other people’s money, so there’s a good chance you could make a large commission, bonus, or one-time fee for work being done now or soon.</p>
<p>There are other possible sources of income that could quell your anxiety about running low on money—an insurance payout, a family contribution of cash, an inheritance, the sale of property, a government social program, a bank loan, venture capital, or a mortgage with good terms—there are many possibilities. You are in a potent period, and next month, April, will be a critical month to forge a breakthrough in your career.</p>
<p>This month holds a major lunar eclipse in Libra, and that is important for you because you are ruled by the moon and more affected by lunar eclipses than any other zodiac sign.</p>
<p>This eclipse will bring to a conclusion a matter that has been pending regarding your home or concerning a family member. Neptune will oppose the moon at eclipse time (and conjoin the new moon, earlier, on March 10), so separating reality from fiction will be a daunting task—go slowly. In the smoke and mirrors environment, you will need to clarify the facts and not make any assumptions. If the situation is complex, don’t hesitate to call an attorney to help you sort things out for the perspective your lawyer can give you could be worth her weight in gold.</p>

        <p>Eclipses can create dramatic change, so stay alert. You may be moving, or you may see a roommate or family member move out, for at these types of events, a person may be “eclipsed out” of your daily environment. If you need funds to fix or ameliorate a situation, Pluto will work with you to help you get the money you need to do so. Jupiter and Uranus, not to be outdone by Pluto, are also standing by to help you. Your financial assistance well might emanate from a friend or from an organized group you belong to or will contact. It could come from other family members, a bank, a government program, or even from a tax refund.</p>
<p>Eclipses repeat every 19 years, and you had a very similar eclipse on October 3, 2005, in the same sign, Libra, but that one was at 10 degrees. Nothing in life duplicates exactly, but if you can recall a certain event, theme, or topic in life that the 2005 eclipse brought up, you will have a clue of what might come up now.</p>
<p>The only caveat is to make sure you have all the facts and that you are not filling in any blank areas with your own assumptions. I say that because Neptune will be so very active at the new moon March 10 and also at the full moon lunar eclipse March 25. Still, this will be a positive eclipse. You will be productive and make a decision that you had put off or were not fully aware you needed to decide on, but apparently now you will. It is the job of an eclipse to bring your attention to a weak link with a certain urgency. Once you attend to it, life improves noticeably as you move forward.</p>
