        <p style="font-weight: 400;">March will be all about looking at your finances. You may be gathering receipts to show your accountant to prepare your tax return, examining your spending to see areas you can cut back on, and studying your savings and investments to see how they are performing.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You may be hoping to get a raise, but you’ve had Saturn in your financial second house, which rules earned income and salary. Saturn has been with you for a year since he first entered this area of your chart in March 2023. Saturn constricts, limits, and tightens everything it touches. We all go through Saturn’s bootcamp with his tough-love way of teaching, and you still have two years to go until he will be gone in February 2026.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Once gone, Saturn will not return to this earned salary portion of your chart until 2052 to 2055, and you will carry the financial wisdom you are learning now throughout the coming nearly three decades. Saturn is a little like self-adjusting shampoo—some people need a little, some people need a lot. Saturn will teach you only what you need to know. If you experienced Saturn in 1993 to 1996 when he was last in Pisces (your financial house), this visit from Saturn will be easier, as theoretically you learned a great deal last time and will only need a refresher course now.</p>
<p>A new moon, which will come on March 10 in your second financial house, usually opens up opportunity, but as said, Saturn standing close by in your financial house is spoiling the pudding for now. Any raise you receive would be so scant as to be insignificant. Quitting your job for another one won’t make life any better either, for the same circumstances will apply—they are caused by Saturn. Saturn will follow you, so you might as well figure out how to make your present job work better for you.</p>

        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Your best recourse is to make yourself indispensable on the job. That is not an easy task, I know, but if you strive to be on your A-game almost all the time, that will get you to where you want to be. Ask if you need more experience in a different department or on different projects so that you can be in line for a promotion. Showing eagerness to get ahead is always a plus.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In your private life, find ways to buy bargains, and you might want to clip coupons, too. If you brew your own morning coffee, you will save money, and cooking your own meals will have you eating more nutritiously, deliciously, and at lower cost. Start with tiny savings, and they will add up. Saturn is trying to show you that you can get more value from the money you already have and are earning.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You may find that clients and employers are tight-fisted and not willing to give you your asking price. You may feel everyone wants you to agree to a lower price. (Still, Saturn is teaching you to negotiate more effectively, so that may change as you go along.)</p>
<blockquote><p>This month’s full moon lunar eclipse on March 25 will light your ninth house of foreign people and places, so you may jet off somewhere that would require your passport for entry. Exciting!</p></blockquote>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">It may even get a little bit harder to hold the line on expenses after March 22 when Mars will enter Pisces, the same part of your chart where Saturn is, and will stay until April 30. Mars often forces up spending, giving you more expenses than usual. It may be that your car needs a new part or that you have not bought clothing for yourself in some time. This happens. This is the first time you will have hosted Mars in Pisces in two years, so it may feel a bit new and different when it comes to the amount of your spending.</p>

        <p style="font-weight: 400;">Mars is known to force up spending when in a financial sector, so if after March 22 you begin writing one check after another at a rapid rate, you might be able to blame Mars. This high expense, high-spending period will drop once Mars leaves your second financial house on April 30.</p>
<p>You may have felt uprooted or in a continual state of renovation, maintenance, décor decoration, and repair. Alternatively, you may have invited family to stay with you on a temporary or permanent basis and were working to take care of their needs, too.</p>
<p>Uranus is not an entirely bad boy this month. He is orbiting close to Jupiter in your home sector, and this month will be in a beautiful angle to the Sun and new moon March 10. As you see, I have to look at the entire sky, not just one aspect, because life is dynamic, and you can have good and not so good news in the same month and on the same topic.</p>
<p>Uranus—which is your ruler and whose job it is to take good care of you—will likely create a twist this month to help you as you try to find money, and the twist will be one that you don’t expect and will arrive in the eleventh hour (that means at the last minute).</p>
<p>It is possible you are not changing your house at all but rather are focused on helping to support a family member financially, emotionally, and maybe with advice and recommendations they have asked you to give them.</p>

        <p>If you are concerned about money, the new moon in Pisces, 20 degrees, on March 10 may help you but it is anyone’s guess how much. Jupiter will support that new moon, which is glorious news, because Jupiter is the planet of luck and good fortune. Jupiter is based in your home sector, a definite sign that whatever actions you are taking to improve the quality of your home or other property you own is appreciating its value in the market with every step you take.</p>
<p>If you are helping a family member, you will find the funds to enact your plan, whether the money comes from your savings or another family member who wants to contribute. The money could come from insurance, a bank loan, or from a government program meant to help families in their situation.</p>
<p>Make all your important moves early in the month because Mercury will go retrograde April 1 to April 25 in your third house of agreements, contracts, leases, and other important paperwork. If you are buying property, do not close the deal during Mercury retrograde. Be careful not to run up against April 1 at the end of the month either—that is playing things too close to Mercury’s backwards run. We always feel the approaching retrograde in advance—you will start to see delays, postponements, and so forth begin as early as March 18.</p>
<p>If you need any expensive products for the home—new furniture, a TV, a new stove, washer-drier, home security system, a computer, cell phone, or even a car—either buy it early in March, or delay the purchase to another glorious month—May.</p>

        <p>This month holds a full moon lunar eclipse, the first of the year, on March 25 in Libra. It will light your ninth house of foreign people and places, so you may be able to jet off somewhere that would require your passport for entry. Exciting! Getting await from all the banging, clanging, and noise at home (or other cares) will be a wonderful relief. If you have frequent flier miles to use for your ticket and a cousin, say, in Rome, you are all set. I know you are not in the mood to spend money these days, but you may have a friend or relative in the location you would love to go who can put you up.</p>
<p>This same full moon eclipse (an eclipse is strong, worthy of three full moons rolled into one) has different ways it may help you. While you may travel, if you work in the import-export of ideas, you may instead be working on the phone or email quite a bit with clients or vendors abroad.</p>
<p>This full moon eclipse might bring you an admission letter from your first-choice university, or if you are already a student, you may get special praise or great marks on a major test taken on or near March 25. Finally, a legal matter may successfully finish, with you favored.</p>
<p>All Aquarians will have reason to be excited and happy by the results of this eclipse on March 25. It’s meant to broaden your view of your world dramatically and panoramically. Later you may feel you looked at life through too narrow a lens.</p>

        <p>The Aquarians who will have the strongest positive experience will be those born within five days of January 24. The same is true if you have Aquarius rising within five degrees of 5 degrees (in other words, from 0 to 10 degrees) or a major natal planet or your natal moon within five degrees of 5 degrees in Aquarius, Gemini, Libra, Aries, Leo, or Sagittarius.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Most Aquarians have been talking lots about all that is going on in their home. You may be dealing with contractors, repairmen, painters, or your home decorator. Or you may be in the process of buying, selling, or renting a new space. Maybe you are done and are now entertaining friends and family. No matter what your goal for your home (or to help a parent, which might alternatively be on your mind), you are going to be glad you are giving your plan some concentration and serious effort.</p>
<p>At this time, your home and family are where the golden nuggets lie in your chart, and this comes thanks to a rare visit from good-fortune Jupiter to your home sector. The changes you are making now to improve the comfort, stylishness, and beauty of your home will pay you dividends for many years to come. You also seem to be giving your family a rock-solid sense of security, so important in life. The universe is speaking clearly to you about these matters.</p>
<p>The start of the month, March 1, brings a dazzling aspect when good-fortune Jupiter, based in your home and family sector, will send a friendly beam to the Sun, showing a positive link between your home and your investment in it. If March 1 is moving day, or the day you name your contractor, decorator, or landscape artist for your grounds, you will be enthusiastic about the results.</p>

        <p>The new moon on March 10 in Pisces at 20 degrees may have you concerned about all the money you are spending lately, and you know where the money is going—you guessed it, on your home or a family member. Saturn is orbiting somewhat close to the Sun and new moon, and sometimes when you are involved in a lifestyle change (which you seem to be), more money than usual needs to be spent to cover expenses. Saturn’s presence usually means that any belt tightening done in the short-term will yield excellent value and profits in the long-term. You may be worrying too much, for you appear to be making slow, careful, and thoughtful decisions, and your horoscope suggests you are happy that the value of your property is appreciating so nicely.</p>
<p>This month, Neptune, the planet of beauty, grace, and artistic expression but also the planet of the mist that can cause confusion or misunderstanding, will be orbiting very close to the new moon March 10. This means you can’t make assumptions when making big decisions, even though elsewhere in your chart you have you glowing support from Jupiter and Uranus. If making a costly or long-term decision, you would need expert legal advice, so do not hesitate to hire a lawyer for any major action you are about to take. If you have a partner or spouse, you will need to rally his or her support too—again, don’t assume this person will go along with any and all of your ideas. Take the time to take this warning to heart.</p>

        <p>This month also holds a lunar full moon eclipse in Libra on March 25, offering you an escape from all the home-related questions you may be dealing with lately. Travel will be favored, and you may spontaneously decide a trip is in order. At the same time, a legal matter may now get resolved. If you work in communications or the publishing or broadcasting industry, you may be finishing up a project and about to show it to the world to great applause.</p>
<p>Pluto, newly minted in Aquarius, will be in perfect support of this eclipse, suggesting your work will have wide appeal, possibly internationally. Eclipses often bring dramatic news, and this eclipse will be friendly to your Aquarius sign, so stay alert to see what comes up.</p>
<p>Romantically, your magnetism is reaching sky-high levels, thanks to the proximity of Venus to Mars, the lovebird planets, in Aquarius in the first half of the month (Venus will leave Aquarius on March 11, and Mars will leave on March 22). When Venus and Mars are together, they set off sparks for the start of new love, so if you are interested in meeting a new love interest, circulate. Even after Venus leaves Aquarius, Mars will stay on until March 22, still exerting good vibrations for your love life. Initially, you may be unaware of your effect on others, but will soon discover it is quite positive and hypnotic.</p>
