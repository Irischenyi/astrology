        <p>March could be a landmark month for you, bringing plenty of changes and improvements to your daily life. The planets are acting in a very positive, supportive way. In the first half of the month, every planet in your chart will be circulating above the horizon with most clustered at the tip-top of your chart. This suggests you will be in the public eye, and you may soon have important, exciting news to share with your friends about your career.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the position of Mars—he is currently in Aquarius, your ninth house, energizing one of the following areas: international relationships and distant travel, higher education, legal matters, or publishing and broadcasting ventures.</p>
<p>Mars entered this house on February 13 and will leave on March 22, so in this time span, you will give one of the areas listed above more of your attention. Gemini often work in the communication arts, so you might be deeply focused on completing a manuscript, producing a podcast, TV, or lecture project, or undergoing research for a paper for college or graduate school. Additionally, throughout February and the first three weeks of March, you may have been, or will be, traveling more than usual.</p>
<p>In early March Mars will be orbiting with his lover Venus in Aquarius—a lovely situation because they adore being together, but they’re most often apart due to their different orbits. When Venus and Mars are together, they are known to produce electric currents that spark new love between two people who meet for the first time. Aquarius is a fellow air sign, a perfect sign for you, Gemini. These two lovebirds, Venus and Mars, made a rare conjunction in Aquarius last month on February 22 and will remain close during the first 10 days of March. Last month Mars favored Gemini born in May and early June, and in March Venus and Mars will favor Gemini with birthdays that fall from June 12 to June 20.</p>

        <p>Mars and Venus in Aquarius will lend you extra sparkle and magnetism, and Mars can make you more attractive and confident. You certainly are popular in your personal and professional life, for your natural charm can delightfully and subtly enhance all your interactions with others.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to look at this month’s headline news—the vital new moon on March 10 in Pisces, your professional tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement. The new moon and the Sun will join both Saturn and Neptune in Pisces (Saturn has been here since March 2023, and Neptune has been here since 2011). Also, Neptune, the planet of creativity, rules your professional tenth house.</p>
<p>The best part about the March 10 new moon is that both Jupiter and Uranus will send golden beams from their base tucked away in Taurus, your twelfth house, to this new moon in Pisces, your career house. This means opportunity will likely strike, and with it, a chance for you to make a generous sum.</p>
<blockquote><p>You have a real-life guardian angel watching out for you in the background who will see that you receive the opportunities you have worked toward and certainly deserve.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Good-fortune Jupiter has been setting up residence in Taurus, your hidden twelfth house, since May 2023, and Uranus has been in this same part of your chart since May 2018. The current and rare proximity of both of these titan planets of the solar system suggests at least one powerful person has noticed your talent, and this individual seems to be working on your behalf with surprisingly positive results. It must be comforting to know you have a guardian angel watching out for you in the background—a real life one, not a fuzzy, blue ghost-like character out of a Disney movie—and this person will see that you receive the opportunities you have worked toward and certainly deserve.</p>
<p>Also at the March 10 new moon, you have Saturn in Pisces in a wide, but still mathematically significant, conjunction to the Sun and new moon in Pisces. It appears you’re about to take on a new role in your industry (or in another field), and it will come with a great deal more responsibility. The last time Saturn was in Pisces, this role would have been beyond your ability to handle, but that was then, this is now, and you are ready.</p>
<p>You may be drawn to this offer because it requires you to learn new things, and as a Gemini, you are always curious and eager to expand your knowledge about a wide variety of topics. You will have one or more experienced, possibly older, people around you to teach you the ropes of your new position thanks to Saturn’s influence. With Saturn here, you will be expected to give your full attention to the job at hand, almost to the exclusion of everything else. If you do, this new venture or position will create the foundation for your future years. The ventures you start with Saturn you get to keep, often forever. The new moon on March 10 will set the stage, and you will soon hear of the opportunity after this new moon appears.</p>
<p>Along with a career opportunity, you might also be doing interviews with the press or launching an advertising or social media campaign. New moons start ventures, so you are seeing a fresh chapter take shape.</p>

        <p>On March 22 when Mars enters Pisces and your tenth house of professional honors, awards, and achievement (the same house illuminated by the March 10 new moon), your career talks will move into high gear. Mars will take the opportunities that are stirring around you after March 10 and give them an extra push forward—Mars will be in your career house from March 22 to April 30.</p>
<p>Your ruler Mercury will be retrograde next month from April 1 to April 25, so it is possible that a company or an individual you worked with quite successfully some time ago will come back to you with an offer to continue the relationship with a new project. When Mercury is retrograde, you can always revisit earlier days without the fear of anything going wrong—you already started this alliance and built the foundation of the association. In this case, it wouldn’t be new, so you can move forward. You didn’t begin the relationship with Mercury retrograde, but you are now continuing it.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to other headline news. We have two approaching eclipses, and the first will appear this month on March 25. This eclipse will fall in air-sign Libra, 5 degrees. Libra is a sign that blends beautifully with your Gemini element, and Libra is your fifth house of love, which rules romance with someone new and also conception, birth, and care of children. Finally, your fifth house, where this eclipse will fall, is the repository of your greatest creative ideas and expression.</p>
<p>You may meet someone new who will figure prominently in your personal life. Or you might decide it’s time to have a baby and set that process in motion. As you will see here, the accent on your creativity is especially strong at this eclipse and can work to boost your career skyward.</p>

        <p>Venus will take the lead at the March 25 eclipse, and happily, Venus will be in Pisces—your prestigious tenth house of professional advancement—and in conversation with Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck. Venus in Pisces is considered the finest place for Venus to be, the place where Venus can express her best powers of beauty, happiness, magnetism, luxury, and ease.</p>
<p>Venus will be the most dominant planet at this eclipse—very strong and extra beneficial.</p>
<p>Pluto, ensconced in Aquarius and your ninth house, will also be highly supportive, which suggests this eclipse may focus more on your career than love, but I could be wrong about this as I cannot see all of the planets in your chart. Pluto’s position in a broadcasting and publishing house (areas where Gemini often excel) indicates that a highly creative venture could come up, one that would bring out your deeply hidden talents, which you may not have even been aware existed inside of you.</p>
<p>If it works out that this eclipse brings love, this fateful meeting seems to take place at your office with someone who has a high-level position. Be discreet.</p>
<p>Neptune’s proximity to the Sun and moon all month, at both the new moon and the eclipse, can mean one of two things. This project may be highly creative and offer you plenty of room to imprint your own imagination and style on it.</p>

        <p>Neptune could have a different effect, however, by you not being given all the information you need, and this would unconsciously tempt you to make what you’d think are rational, logical assumptions that are not at all correct and could bite you later. Ask many questions, including a number of “what if…?” hypotheticals. Aim to cover all instances, even ones you feel would not be likely to come up. The March 25 eclipse does seem to bring a good project, provided you check what you would be expected to achieve and thoroughly consider the people involved.</p>
<p>The March 25 eclipse offers a definite possibility for finding new love (if unattached) and will certainly amplify your social life. Welcoming a baby is also a possibility. Pluto is in a favorable angle to Neptune (an out-of-sign sextile) and to this full moon eclipse (trine), so there is support—and it could boost your career, too.</p>
<p>In all, everything this month looks to be thumbs-up and very positive, provided you do your homework ahead of accepting the offer.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>As you enter March, you might be ready for a change of scenery and to take in the new colors, sounds, and tastes of a fresh setting. If travel is not possible, you might instead decide to go back to college or graduate school to take courses because your mind is hungry for stimulation. Alternatively, you could attend a lecture and book-signing event or an important museum opening. You will be eager to take in more of the world around you.</p>

        <p>Mars is still traveling with his cosmic lover Venus in Aquarius and your ninth house, an area of your chart that works to expand your thinking. The ninth house is basically an intellectual sector that rules the information you take in (college and beyond) and share (by teaching, debating, writing, or speaking and through publishing, broadcasting, and legal matters). This house, which Mars is stimulating, also rules both international travel and import-export, so your outlook to enjoy a broadening experience in early March is fabulous.</p>
<p>Next, watch what happens just after the new moon on March 10 when an exciting career opportunity is likely to become the most important event of the season, possibly the year. This could be a moment when you receive a dream job opportunity. It may come in the form of a new client, if you work for yourself, or a new position or promotion if you work for others. You are ready to take on a great deal more responsibility due to the position of Saturn, and it will come with additional power and influence. Continue to watch what happens in the days and weeks after March 10.</p>
<p>When Mars enters this same professional sector (Pisces) from March 22 to April 30, career talks will blaze even brighter. There will be lots to learn in your new role, but that’s the part you might like best. Take offers you get in March seriously for they will be some of the most prestigious you will see in all of 2024.</p>
<p>Jupiter (luck) and Uranus (sudden surprises) will support this new moon, so in this powerful month, anything could happen, and it would happen fast and without any hint it is coming. You will have to be decisive. Stay optimistic and aim high.</p>

        <p>This month also holds a full moon lunar eclipse in Libra on March 25 that will light your fifth house, ruling romance, children, and creativity. At this eclipse, Venus will play a big role, and she will be near Saturn who will steady her, making Venus exert a more realistic vibration than usual. You may meet someone with a wide age difference from you, but this probably won’t matter too much to you. Listen to the advice of friends who will have your best interests in mind.</p>
<p>At the full moon lunar eclipse on March 25, emotions will reach a crest, and if you have been dating someone for a while, you will need to know what to do about this relationship. This eclipse is strong and very friendly, so you may get engaged. Conversely, if you have not been happy and despite efforts have not been able to improve your connection, you might leave this person so you can free yourself to pursue a new and more suitable partner. If you haven’t met your one truelove yet, this eclipse could trigger a first meeting.</p>
<p>Alternatively, this eclipse may bring a pregnancy or a plan for special care for your child.</p>

        <p>This eclipse could also deliver news of an exciting creative project. Pluto will be beautifully oriented to the March 25 full moon eclipse, so you will have support from an authority figure (or a relative) who is based at a distance, possibly even in another country. If you’re unsure of what to do, talk things over with this person—he or she will give you useful advice.</p>
<p>Neptune, the planet of vision and creativity, will be conjunct the Sun and March 10 new moon, and he will also be active at the eclipse of March 25. You seem to be prized for your stylishness and ability to spot emerging trends well before others perceive them, but Neptune can cause confusion, so be sure you are given a detailed account of all you will be expected to do for any new job or project you take on. Take nothing for granted. As they say, trust—but verify.</p>
