        <p>The month starts off with an important new moon in Scorpio on November 1 to light your financial eighth house of other people’s money. This new moon will receive a magnificent beam from Saturn, the planet that brings stability, and in this case, Saturn has the ability to bring you a sense of financial fulfillment and a long-term sense of security. In the Aries solar chart, Saturn rules your tenth house of career. VIPs seem quite impressed with your performance, so whatever you are doing is clearly hitting the mark.</p>
<p>Pluto will be the lead planet at this time, and for the first time since 1921-1922, Pluto will make a gorgeous, harmonious trine to Uranus. (This aspect will not be exact until July 18, 2026). Still, these two powerhouse planets will be within four degrees of an exact trine, bringing great harmony, so you will feel the help from Pluto. All this means that you will have the ability to make a great deal of money. Of course, too much emphasis on money is not wise, but considering inflation, this is excellent news.</p>
<p>If anyone owes you money, you are likely to receive it this month. It might be a bonus, commission, royalty, or insurance payout, if you filed a claim. It could be money you receive from a judgment in a court case. If you want to buy a house, this new moon will help you make an application for a mortgage with every reason to expect a later approval from the bank. If you want to start a business, you should make a pitch for venture capital or a business line of credit. If you want to go to college or graduate school, a scholarship or generous financial aid may be granted to you. At the same time if you owe money or plan to make an expensive purchase, you will likely be doing so in early November.</p>

        <p>Beyond the above-mentioned possibilities, this could be a good time to review your portfolio with your broker or financial advisor in an effort to keep and grow the money you earn and invest. It’s a good time to review spending and savings, and to tweak investments and any unnecessary spending that you could eliminate. You might be sending a large check or wire this month, but it seems not to be a surprise—it could be an estimated tax payment for this year if you are self-employed, a down payment on a house, or money for buying or leasing a car, as some examples.</p>
<p>This new moon of November 1 is due to be a peach, for a golden triangle will appear in the sky linking Mercury in Scorpio (news), 28 degrees, in your financial eighth house to Mars in Cancer at 29 degrees in your fourth house of home and family. Both Mercury and Mars will connect to the third leg of the triangle—visionary, creative Neptune in Pisces, 28 degrees, in your house of love and children, creating an expression of pure harmony.</p>
<p>A Grand Trine like this in water signs offer you sharp intuition regarding the topics covered by each of the houses involved in the triangle. The fact that your ruler Mars is part of this gorgeous triangle is significant—it can help you in important ways this month, especially with home and property matters and also in regard to the care of a family member or child.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is hard to imagine how your request for a raise, or a better salary from a new firm, would be turned down. You are magic when it comes to money this month.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Mars will begin to retrograde next month on December 6 and won’t turn back to being direct until February 23, so use this time—your more productive month—to your full advantage. Mars’ little brother Mercury, a mischievous “Dennis the Menace,” knowing his big brother Mars will soon go retrograde, will play a little game and opt to go retrograde first. Oh, boy!</p>
<p>We have Mercury going retrograde from November 25 to December 15, overlapping Mars’ longer retrograde period. This will harm Black Friday and Cyber Monday—not a time to buy expensive items, especially not products that contain electronic chips or internal gears. The world is going into a slow, quiet period of review—looking back over the previous year and making course corrections will be the order of the day for weeks and months ahead. (And no, this trend is not tied to politics or the US, or any other nation’s, election—it is what it is.)</p>
<p>Your meditation on finances won’t be over until the full moon arrives on November 15 in Taurus, 24 degrees. The moon will then be orbiting with Uranus, so the only thing I can say is to expect the unexpected when it comes to money. You may wonder whether that is due to be a good or bad surprise. I will say good. Miraculously, the full moon and Uranus, orbiting tightly together, will be beautifully oriented to Pluto in your prestigious solar tenth house of career. This is still another indication of how powerfully you are impressing the powers-that-be at the top (or a client if you are self-employed).</p>
<p>This full moon may bring you a bundle of money or a raise in salary. You may get good news from your financial advisor about a blue-chip stock investment you made earlier or that you won a cash prize in a contest or TV game show. There are lots of possibilities.</p>

        <p>Also, Neptune will step forward and send a sparkling beam to both the Sun and full moon on November 15, so this is help on quite a high level. Your creative solutions are causing you to hit one home run after another. I cannot see everything in your personal chart from where I sit, but from what I CAN see, this full moon of November 15 (plus five days) could bring exciting financial news.</p>
<p>After all your negotiations are finished, you will be ready for a change in scene. The new moon on November 30 will be in Sagittarius, 10 degrees, and give you the urge to travel in the days and weeks that follow. Again, your chart is looking bright for Mars in your fifth house of romance, leisure, children, and creative pursuits will be ideally positioned to the November 30 new moon. This trip will not be for business but for personal reasons, to experience romance and spend time with those who mean the most to you.</p>
<p>Even though you may be leaving town for several days, the work you’ve already done at the office will continue to rack up raves. Venus is in your prestigious tenth house of career leadership and advancement, so your popularity clearly runs across the board among peers, subordinates, and VIPs alike. Venus will receive a darling beam from Uranus in your earned income sector, still ANOTHER clue of how well you are doing and how management is thinking of lavishing you with money, lest they lose you. Eventually this will add up to more compensation for you. This month the universe is speaking loud and clear—you are doing well!</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>A major portion of the month will be given over to financial management. You might be motivated to examine how you’ve done over the past year and decide if any adjustments will be necessary. Saturn will be in a superb angle to the new moon of November 1, so as long as you are getting solid advice from a trusted advisor, your decisions should work out exceedingly well, and you should be able to leave 2024 in better financial shape than when you entered it.</p>

        <p>Pluto will be dominant at this new moon, and happily, Uranus will send a missive to Pluto, suggesting that you’ll get a lucky twist to an emerging financial-professional situation at the last minute. This suggests you may get a generous raise, a large sum of money (in the form of a fee), or an unexpected offer for a new position out of the blue just after the November 1 new moon arrives. If you work for yourself, a new, lucrative client may walk through the door convinced that you are the one to hire, based on your history of stellar performances. Keep checking your email and your cell phone powered up!</p>
<p>At the same time, a golden triangle will appear int the sky, linking your ruler Mars in Cancer to Neptune in Pisces and to Mercury in Scorpio. You have seen a number of these divinely harmonious golden triangles, so you might assume they are commonplace—they are not. In fact, they are quite rare. In astrology they are called a Grand Trine.</p>
<p>You will be lucky to have this water-sign Grand Trine of planets, for it will sharpen your instincts regarding money, real estate, or home/family-related matters and allow you to make decisions in the absence of full, detailed information, if necessary. We all want full information, but sometimes a situation is ambiguous, and getting more facts simply isn’t possible—that’s where your intuition will kick in.</p>
<p>The new moon on November 1 in Scorpio will also give you the motivation to examine how you can more wisely earn, save, spend, and invest your money. As a financially wise Aries, the idea of making money while you sleep is likely to be quite appealing. The November 1 new moon is a peach—and unusual, too. You’ve not had a new moon this positive in your financial eighth house for several years. At this new moon, Saturn, the planet of long-term gain, will be in direct, supportive contact with the Sun, indicating you can have a profitable financial outcome if you focus on your finances as the month opens. Saturn’s involvement suggests your best approach will be a methodical and conservative one. (Saturn teaches a slow-and-steady approach wins, so eschew any “get-rich-quick” schemes.)</p>

        <p>The full moon in Taurus of November 15 will continue and finalize your efforts to make money. Like earlier in this month, as you seek advice and go through negotiations, you will likely be outstandingly protected by a loving universe. Full moons bring closure, so you will be moving rapidly toward an agreement.</p>
<p>At this full moon November 15, Pluto will still be in his last days of your tenth house of career, and at the same time, Uranus is in your salary-oriented second house, and both are in supremely harmonious positions to each other. It is hard to imagine how your request for a raise, or a better salary from a new firm, would be turned down. You are magic when it comes to money this month. If you are in sales, you should find clients willing to cut deals to your mutual satisfaction. If you are young and new to negotiating, you might want to stock up on books that will outline how to craft win-win deals, where both sides benefit from the collaboration.</p>
<p>Uranus, the planet of unexpected news, will play a major, uplifting role at the full moon November 15. You may be quite surprised at how well talks go for you.</p>
<p>Mercury is about to go retrograde, November 25 to December 15, so with weather delays (or transportation strikes or other problems), it would be important to ship early, for buying and shipping holiday gifts ideally finishes by the first week of December. Retailer inventory will run low quickly too, so you don’t want to have to choose another gift for someone you love because the perfect gift you researched is out of stock. If you buy gift cards, take the extra step to photocopy each one, front and back, and write the recipient’s name on the photocopy. If the card is lost, you’ll easy be able to replace it. The probability of things getting lost increases whenever Mercury is retrograde, this time from November 25 to December 15.</p>

        <p>The new moon of November 30 in Sagittarius will brighten your desire to leave town and enjoy a change of scene. By month’s end, you will have completed your meditations over money, so your mind will be hungry for the intellectual stimulation that travel can give you. If you can take vacation time to travel near or far, leave town within the week following the new moon, November 30, for the most fun on your travels. You might want to revisit a place you loved when you were a child but have never returned to—walking down memory lane now can be the best part of Mercury retrogrades.</p>
<p>Not every Aries can leave town, of course. With Saturn in hard angle to the new moon November 30, you may feel that obligations at home and at work will make it near-impossible for you to travel. In that case, find other ways to enjoy life, which will be a big message of this joyful new moon. To that end, consider enjoying holiday lights and store displays in town, or make it a point to take a small child to see Santa (whether it be your child or a child of a friend or family member). Seeing the delight in that child’s eyes as they visit “Santa’s workshop” may be the high point of your season. Dinner in an inexpensive bistro decked-out in holiday cheer might also fit the bill. You might want to attend a holiday concert or ballet—there are many possibilities to add sparkle to your month.</p>
<p>There is another reason you may opt to remain home—you may be excited about entertaining family and friends. Create a cozy, welcoming, wonderful home, complete with the aroma of cookies in the oven. After the silver is polished and the menu set, and you’ve decked the halls with boughs of holly, you will be ready to lavish love on everyone you hold dear.</p>
