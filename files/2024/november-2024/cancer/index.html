        <p>On November 1 you have a friendly new moon in Scorpio at 10 degrees, and this moon is made for promoting love and affection. A new moon opens a door wide to new opportunities, and for you it is meant to open your heart to a richer emotional life. The area of your chart that is being accented by this new moon is your fifth house. This house is all about love, not only love for a person you are dating, but also your spouse if you are married.</p>
<p>If you have children, your heart will swell with joy by being with them, so perhaps you will plan a surprise vacation for them. If you hope to have children, a pregnancy may now come up. As a side bonus to this new moon, your imagination will expand, and your creativity will impress others at work and at home.</p>
<p>Whatever is going on in your personal and emotional life will be very favorable. Saturn will also be smiling on this new moon, bringing you enduring affection and a chance to bond with the ones you love. This energy also means that decisions you make regarding romance or children are likely to be solid, long-lasting, and very satisfying. Having Saturn on your side is a big plus.</p>
<p>Single Cancers might meet someone new, and if so, he or she might remain with you quite a while, most likely because you are fascinated by this person, and they treat you well.</p>

        <p>Pluto will be the dominant planet at this new moon and will receive delightfully happy beams from surprise-a-minute Uranus from your eleventh house of joy and happiness. You certainly can expect a surprise twist to come up, and it will dazzle you. Mercury and Neptune will join in to support Pluto’s efforts, so this new moon on November 1 should bring an avalanche of good feelings in the weeks and months ahead.</p>
<p>If your birthday falls within five days of July 2, you will get a double dip of pleasure. This is also true if you have a Cancer rising or your natal moon at plus or minus five degrees of 10 degrees. Check to see if you have a natal planet in Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces at 10 degrees (plus or minus five degrees)—that planet will light up and help you as well.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn our attention to the full moon of November 15, for it will carry forth the joy and social fun that was so prevalent at the new moon. This full moon will arrive in Taurus, 24 degrees, in your eleventh “fairy-tale” house of hopes and wishes. This time, however, the eleventh house will bring you not a dream or fairy tale but real-life joy from friends and new people you will meet. It looks like you will be invited to an important event that will surround you with many happy individuals, some of whom you know (because they are good friends) and some of whom you don’t.</p>
<blockquote><p>Pluto will move to Aquarius on November 19, to stay in your financial eighth house nearly 20 years! This can, and should, help your financial picture.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Taurus is a sensuous sign, so the likelihood is that the event will be quite beautiful with a touch of luxury about it. The people will be well-dressed and good-looking, the food and wine superb, and it seems there will be a profusion of fresh flowers. Even if the event is connected to a convention or seminar (instead of a party or friend’s wedding—it could be either), the message I see is that no expense will be spared by the host to ensure you have a great time.</p>
<p>This full moon will be conjunct Uranus, so things are certainly going to be surprising and out of the ordinary. No matter what you think is about to happen, it won’t—but something else will! Events look excitingly favorable for you, so there is no need to be concerned. If you are invited to a gathering, go!</p>
<p>If your birthday falls on July 16, plus or minus five days, you will feel the full moon in an especially strong way. The same is true if you have Cancer rising or your natal moon in Cancer at 24 degrees (plus or minus five degrees). Also, check your chart to see if you have a natal planet in Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces at 24 degrees (again, plus or minus five degrees)—if you do, that planet will go out of its way to help you.</p>
<p>You may become concerned about cash flow this month, for Mars is about to raise expenses from November 3 to January 6. In the middle of this period, Mars will backtrack and go retrograde from December 6 to February 23. Even after Mars goes direct on February 23, he won’t fully regain his former strength until April 30 (although, admittedly, life will improve after February 23). Mars is the natural ruler of your solar tenth house, so you may not make the assertive steady progress in your career that you had hoped for. I know this is bad timing when money seems scarce, but this is an unusual situation that will straighten out shortly.</p>
<p>Mars will move back into Cancer on January 6, giving you much more control than you have in November and December. This cash crunch is an aberration from the norm, and as said, is temporary. You will be moving into a very favorable period in June, so keep to your goals and don’t become discouraged. There is another reason you should keep your spirits high when it comes to money.</p>

        <p>Pluto will move to Aquarius on November 19, to stay in your financial eighth house until January 18, 2044 (nearly 20 years!). This can, and should, help your financial picture. Pluto is a powerhouse of a financial planet and should help to unearth additional money to supplement your regular salary. You may get a large one-time payment for a side job, or you may receive a large commission, royalty, tax refund, or financial court settlement. You might start to get child support after a long absence, or you could win money on a TV game show. You may win a scholarship or substantial financial aid for college. If you need to put in a claim for an insurance payout, it might turn out to be generous. It’s also possible you will qualify for a large mortgage, bank loan, infusion of venture capital, or line of credit for your business.</p>
<p>Another advantage of hosting Pluto in a financial house is that you probably won’t have to wait long to see Pluto start to help you. You have to do your part by paying bills on time and keeping a good credit rating, but if you do, Pluto will richly reward you by seeing you get all kinds of extra money.</p>
<p>The month will end on November 30 with a new moon in Sagittarius, 10 degrees, in your sixth house of work assignments. If you have felt your office has been a little slow lately, this new moon should change that. If you are self-employed and pitching clients, this new moon will bring opportunities for new business. If you have been out of work and frustrated that you seem not to be able to find a job that suits you, this new moon will help you find a job similar to the one you had previously—with (hopefully) better compensation. (Note: A new moon in the sixth house does not advance your career to a new level, but it does help you hone your skills—do a good job here, and you will be on the short list when promotions are given out later.)</p>

        <p>But wait—the best part about this new moon is that Mars will be in perfect position to stimulate this new moon’s energy. Since Mars RULES your prestigious tenth house of career (the house that elevates your standing in your company or industry at large) and is currently found IN your second house of earned income, this is another sign that you can find ways to improve your income. Mars is beaming to the Sun and new moon in your work-a-day assignment sector (sixth house), so on all sides of this new moon on November 30, it looks like you can generate a flurry of business in early December. Furthermore, the Sun is the natural ruler of Cancer’s second house of earned income, yet another reason that this new moon should help your cash flow.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this is not a full moon (which brings culmination or an ending). Rather, this is a NEW moon, which sets off a fresh chapter that will be at play for as long as nearly six months into the future. Admittedly, its influence will be strongest during the first two weeks of December. You may be able to take advantage of clients’ year-end budgets that must be spent before the New Year or customers who were given holiday cash and gift cards they are eager to spend.</p>
<p>This new moon on November 30 in Sagittarius will also renew your resolve to get fit and healthy. You might want to consider seeing your doctor for your annual battery of tests and screenings—this would be a good time to do so. If you feel progress at the gym has plateaued, you might want to treat yourself to a package of lessons from a professional trainer—you may see breakthrough results.</p>
<p>A new moon in the sixth house has one other benefit—it’s a great time to get a pet for your household, as long as you adopt before Mercury retrogrades November 25 to December 15. Do so immediately! If you have a pet, pay more attention to your little creature by taking him for longer walks, bringing him to the vet for his checkup, and picking up one or two new toys or a treat. If you live in a cold climate, a little winter coat for your dog or a new cozy little bed for your kitten will do the trick.</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Turn away from your computer, dear Cancer, stand up, and dress up, for in November it’s time to play. The new moon in Scorpio on November 1 will light your fifth house of true love along with the Sun and Mercury. Each of these heavenly bodies will put you in a joyful, romantic, and party-ready mood. If you say romance has been practically non-existent, that’s likely because you’ve been working so hard.</p>
<p>Traveling to an exciting and distant city might be an option for you now, for Saturn, based in your ninth house of international people and places, is beautifully oriented to the new moon and Sun. If you can go, this could turn out to be a memorable trip, and if you have a partner, you will foster greater closeness with your sweetheart or spouse. If you’ve ever had to convince your partner to come along with you, that won’t be the case this time—your other half will gleefully want to join you.</p>
<p>Mars has been in Cancer since September 4 but will move to Leo on November 3, which means you will be spending more money than usual, and this trend will continue until January 6. You may already know what your upcoming expenses will be.</p>
<p>Mars will retrograde next month on December 6 until February 23, and that will make it harder to show productivity at work. Clients will be slow to make a commitment, and even after Mars moves direct, he will not regulate his orbit until April 30. This is one aspect that will affect everyone of every sign to a large degree, although you in particular have a higher propensity to feel the financial aspect of Mars’ position.</p>

        <p>In the meantime, Mars’ little brother Mercury, hearing that his big brother is about to take a long nap (in retrograde), will go retrograde, too (Mercury is known to be a little copycat). Mercury will want to beat his big brother to retrograde and will be out of phase from November 25 to December 15, returning back to high energy by January 2. After Mars and Mercury come out of retrograde, Venus will take her turn to go retrograde from March 1 to April 11, 2025, fully regulating by May 15.</p>
<p>As you see, part of the coming weeks will overlap with two key planets in retrograde. Knowing this, get started on your most vital tasks early in November. Also, it would be wise to shop for holiday gifts during the first two weeks of November—no later—or be resigned to giving gift cards to friends and family. If that’s the plan, do a little reconnaissance and find out each person’s favorite store before you get that gift card.</p>
<p>The theme of social fun will continue at the full moon in Taurus on November 15, when you will almost certainly have an event to attend. It may be a party, or it might be that you will attend an important convention, seminar, or political or charity fundraiser. Your choice to go seems to be spontaneous, or it may be that the invitation arrives at the last minute. Uranus will be active and friendly, so you can expect the unexpected over this full moon—all of it good. The event appears to be great fun, with many successful people in attendance you will want to meet and converse with.</p>

        <p>However, you seem to have one concern—the cost of attending this event. It could be expensive, and you might think twice about going, especially since you may be invited on short notice. You may have little or no time to decide, so put aside money in advance for this purpose. This invitation is coming at a time when Mars is creating a need for you to spend more money than usual, either by choice or necessity.</p>
<p>Even so, the event may be worth going to because you are likely to make new friendships and associations with successful people. You’ll also probably have a lot of fun. It appears your spouse or sweetheart will want to come along, too. With Uranus conjunct the full moon, the event could bring an unusual twist to your experience that you will not anticipate, which adds an element of surprise.</p>
<p>Once you get to month’s end, the emphasis will shift, and you will need to be alert, organized, and ready to roll up your sleeves at work. The new moon of November 30 in Sagittarius will bring in a new assignment. You will have to temporarily let go of the soft, romantic vibe you enjoyed earlier in November. Your focus will need to change so you can do well on the project, and you may have to view life through a new lens. Still, you won’t forget the light, airy, and romantic moments you experienced earlier in sweet November.</p>
