        <p>You have an extraordinary chart in November. It will seem like nearly every part of your life is vying for attention—it’s a good, solid month where you can make a lot of progress. Developments in your home, property, or family life along with unusual, and possibly great, news about your career will make this a busy, productive month. You will also have time to discover new love or find fresh ways to enjoy romance with your present partner. In all, this has every earmark of being a month to remember.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the highly friendly new moon that begins the month on November 1 in Scorpio, 10 degrees, which will appear in your home and family sector. In the days that follow, you may decide to give your apartment or house an upgraded look for the coming holidays. If you move or renovate, you will likely not need or want to find a new place again for a very long time, possibly forever—you will like your space too much to leave. The reason I say this is because Saturn will give you his gift of stability, heighten your sense of security, and bring you long-term gain.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a perfect piece of furniture, ideal decorations, or beautiful tableware to help you celebrate the holidays, you can find it because Uranus will give you that element of luck to come across precisely what you want. Of course, if you’ve been hoping to locate the right new space to move into, this is the new moon of the year to accomplish your goal.</p>
<p>Sometimes when we have a new moon in the domestic sector, we don’t use it to improve our living situation but instead direct this energy to assist a family member, most likely a parent or child who needs advice, attention, and loving care. This is a new moon, so you may be setting up a new situation for one of your parents—hiring a nurses aid or finding an assisted living facility are among the many possibilities that will fit your parent’s needs. Or you may be searching for a new school for your child or tutor who can give your child special lessons on a topic he or she has been struggling with.</p>

        <p>Pluto rules Scorpio (sign of the new moon) and your solar fourth house, so a distant relative or close family member (even a spouse or ex-spouse) might urge you to agree to a solution. Entertain this person’s advice, but don’t accept it if you don’t feel comfortable with this option. The pressure on you will be strong and insistent, so step away from this conversation to allow yourself to be alone with your thoughts for as long as you need.</p>
<p>This is a new moon on November 1, not a full moon, so there won’t be an urgency to decide—take your time. As you move away from the day that Mars will be opposed to Pluto (to make an exact aspect on November 3), the tension will subside. The more days you can muster to separate from November 3, the better. Ideally, the person pressuring you will realize you are your own person. Saturn, the plant of patience and practicality, will help you at this new moon and add a feeling of calm. You don’t have to cave in to another person’s demands—take plenty of time to think.</p>
<p>Your mind will immediately switch to your career, reputation, and standing in your industry at the full moon on November 15 in Taurus at 24 degrees. This full moon will shine at the most elevated part of your chart, your tenth house of professional leadership and achievement, so something is coming to a culmination for you, such as a new job or promotion. Alternatively, you may have an important piece of publicity coming out in the press at this time, and if so, it would be so laudatory that your name will be on everyone’s lips in your field. It is clear that the work you’ve done on an assignment has been able to showcase your talents and your future potential.</p>
<blockquote><p>To shine, a diamond has to be in the right setting. If you are not appreciated at work, you will find that better setting this month.</p></blockquote>

        <p>I feel this full moon on November 15 will be so good for you that even if you suffer a setback or lose your job due to a downsizing, this “bad news” will open a fresh possibility for you to find a much better position. To be clear, I am not saying you will be laid off, but I cannot see every aspect in your individual, unique chart. I am suggesting that no matter what comes up, it will strongly benefit you. Sometimes you have to break the chains of the past to be released into a new and far better future. To shine, a diamond has to be in the right setting. If you are not appreciated, you will find that better setting.</p>
<p>The strongest career aspect at play on November 15 will be a direct link between powerhouse Pluto in your sixth house of work projects, the Sun, and the full moon in your prestigious tenth house of professional accomplishment. The time between November 14 and November 20 could bring a landmark moment in your career, and when this news comes, it will be completely unexpected.</p>
<p>You only get one full moon in your tenth house of advancement per year, and the one on November 15 is it—and it is exquisitely friendly. Neptune, the planet of artistic creativity, will also be drawn into the conversation from your financial eighth house, so if you have a creative profession, Neptune will also help you and see that you receive proper compensation for your talent.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to another topic—Mars, the action planet, will move into Leo on November 3 to stay until January 6, 2025. The problem is, Mars will go retrograde in Leo on December 6 and will stay retrograde in Leo until he backs into Cancer on January 6, 2025. It is always a plus to have Mars in your sign—Mars will make you more courageous and determined to succeed, and he will also sharpen your ability and motivation to compete well. This is true, even when Mars is in a weak, debilitated retrograde state.</p>

        <p>With Mars going back and forth, you may waffle about a decision you’ve made in your personal life. Mars is the natural ruler of your ninth house of international relationships, long-distance travel, and matters having to do with your pursuits involving higher education (undergraduate and graduate studies). The ninth house, which Mars will be linked to in your solar chart, also covers any work you might do in the media, specifically in publishing or broadcasting. Finally, the ninth house covers legal matters, which may bring a few new twists and turns.</p>
<p>Use November to make your biggest initiations—do so before Mars goes retrograde on December 6.</p>
<p>Another complication coming up this month is that Mercury will go retrograde from November 25 to December 15—not a time to make any key commitments or decisions. It’s also not a time to buy expensive gifts, especially electronics, and that will make Black Friday and Cyber Monday tricky for holiday shopping. Be careful. It may be better to buy a gift card at a retail store that your recipient loves to frequent.</p>
<p>If you go this route, know that Murphy’s Law will be in effect (“if it can happen, it will happen”), so take the extra step to photocopy the front and back of the gift card and write the amount and name of the recipient on the photocopy. Provided you do this, should this person lose his card, you can always replace it quickly.</p>

        <p>If you are saying—“Wait! Having Mars in my sign is an advantage, but it seems that I will be losing most of Mars’ benefits because he will be weak in retrograde. This doesn’t sound fair! Mars typically comes to Leo every two years! Do I have to wait two years to have Mars back in Leo?”</p>
<p>No worries, dear Leo. Once Mars becomes strong again, he will return to Leo a few months from now and will move direct in Leo from April 17 to June 17, 2025. You won’t lose any of Mars’ benefits. In fact, even a weak Mars in your sign (as you will have in December) is better than not having Mars in your sign at all. See? It’s all good.</p>
<p>As you see, this month will bring a lot of important developments, both in your private life, with home and family, and in your career.</p>
<p>By this month’s end, you will need a change and will want room to unwind and have some fun. The universe agrees and is planning to bring you an outstanding period.</p>
<p>The new moon on November 30 in fellow fire-sign Sagittarius, 10 degrees, will be a joyful blessing. It will light your fifth house of fun and romance just in time for the year-end holidays. A new moon is not like a full moon—a new moon has a MUCH longer field of influence that can last for nearly six months, although it is always at its very strongest when the new moon appears and in the two weeks that follow (November 30 to December 14).</p>
<p>If you are single and hoping to find your one truelove, you need to circulate at parties because your chances of having a fateful meeting will go up dramatically. If you are already attached, your fun quotient will skyrocket. The extraordinary part of this new moon is that Mars in Leo and your first house of personality will be in perfect angle to this new moon in your truelove sector. Wow. You need not do anything but be yourself while you’re out and about. You have all the magnetism and confidence you need to draw others in. If you are attached, Jupiter will help clear your schedule so that you can fit in as many special days as you’d like to enjoy your one truelove.</p>

        <p>Jupiter, the good fortune planet, will partner with the new moon on November 30 by being in Gemini (the sign opposite this Sagittarius new moon). Jupiter is in your eleventh house of your dearly held hopes and wishes—a wonderful indication that you are in a potent period for meeting a new love interest.</p>
<p>Your eleventh house, where Jupiter will remain until June 2025, is also a sector that is highly social, which suggests that many present and new friends will circulate around you. You might want to join a social or professional club or work for a charity where you will find like-minded people. Also, ask your friends to make introductions—they are golden for you now. Jupiter is not only the giver of gifts and luck but also the planet of growth and miracles, so from now until early June, step out and see what happens.</p>
<p>One last, departing word—this month powerhouse Pluto will move into your opposite sign of Aquarius and your seventh house of serious, committed relationships. Pluto will stay there for nearly 20 years, until January 19, 2044. Sometime in the coming years, you will be quite attracted to powerful, strong-willed partners in love (marriage) and business (contractual collaborations).</p>
<p>The individual you align yourself with may be a little too forceful about having their own way. As a Leo, you are a strong person, so I am not too concerned about this coming trend. When, or if, you don’t like an idea your partner presents, I have no doubt that you will be able to counter with a strong reason why it is not a viable option for you. On the upside, this person is likely to be super successful, so if you join forces in business, you should do quite well.</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>The moment you enter November, you may see your home (or other property you own or rent) buzzing with activity. The new moon of November 1 in Scorpio will bring you a plethora of possibilities for you to consider in your quest to improve your living environment. This will be your best point of the year to get started on your dream to upgrade your house so that it’s more comfortable and inviting. You might want to make small changes, such as to have several rooms painted or to buy a beautiful new piece of furniture. If you would like to go all in and work on a big project, you may decide to renovate your present home or even take the step to move to a larger space. Alternatively, you might choose to rent or buy a vacation property or be entrepreneurial and build a simple A-frame in a scenic area to list on Airbnb.</p>
<p>Big dreams often require major funding, so if you have a large domestic project in mind, you may be “shopping” for the cash you’ll need to bring it to life. If so, again, you are in luck this month because Saturn, based in your eighth house of other people’s money, will be quite favorable to you. A sympathetic banker could decide to help you.</p>
<p>If your roommate moves out, you may choose to keep your apartment for yourself. Or if you need to search for a new roommate, early November would be the right time to start interviewing possible candidates. On another score, you will have luck from your family and will also create good fortune for them—it will work both ways. By this I mean that your household will support your domestic decisions wholeheartedly, and if you need a special favor, ask a parent or kindly older relative to help you. On the other hand, if you have been searching for answers to care for a parent or other immediate family member, the right options will show up now, and this person will likely be delighted with your suggestions.</p>

        <p>This will be a key month for you because Mars, the action planet that teaches you how to best compete, will enter Leo on November 3, to remain in your sign until January 6, 2025. Later, Mars will reemerge in Leo on April 17 until June 17, 2025. Mars takes two years to make a complete rotation around the Sun, so we tend to only have his help every two years for a period of six to seven weeks. The reason Mars will be returning to Leo so quickly in mid-April 2025 is because on December 6 Mars will retrograde, first in Leo, then in Cancer, and this retrograde will continue until February 23.</p>
<p>Once Mars goes forward, he will finally make it back to Leo on April 17, 2025, to stay almost nine weeks (a longer period than usual). Mars is the energy planet, so you might want to consider acting on your major initiatives in November’s first two weeks while Mars is still somewhat healthy (but admittedly, starting to show signs of slowing down a little bit).</p>
<p>While retail sales will advertise alluring deals at the end of November, a sale is not a bargain if your recipient won’t be delighted with your gift. Mercury retrograde may make you want to rush to buy a present for a loved one that is “almost good” instead of something that will really be a hit. You need not spend a lot of money to still excite someone with what you give them. To please this person, the answer lies in the research you do about their interests beforehand.</p>
<p>Realize that Mercury will retrograde on November 25 until December 15, so begin your most important initiatives during the first 10 days of November for best results. You will want to keep a space of days empty before Mercury turns retrograde because you will start to feel the slowdown Mercury creates much earlier. On a personal level, it will be important to finish your holiday shopping as quickly as possible.</p>

        <p>Your prestigious standing in your industry, company, and community will be spotlighted by the full moon on November 15 in Taurus (allow an extra five days, until November 20, to feel its effects). This full moon will give you a superb chance to advance. Uranus will be conjunct this full moon, and both will be friendly to Pluto in your work-a-day projects sector. It seems you will have a chance to handle a complex assignment and showcase your talents. If you put in a stellar performance, you will open the door to more lucrative and prestigious opportunities in the future.</p>
<p>With Uranus involved in a friendly way to this full moon, news will likely surprise you, and circumstances will not unfold in the way you would assume—they could work out better than you would have imagined. The November 15 full moon in Taurus will have a practical, financially sound influence, and this full moon’s lovely glance at Neptune suggests that you will add vision and creativity to your work, too.</p>
<p>After a month of focusing on home, family, career, and money, you will welcome the new moon on November 30 in Sagittarius and your sector of true love. Although you will still feel some pressure of responsibility at work and at home from family members who depend on you, you will have a solid chance for fun and romance. In the days that follow November 30, the universe will be laying a trail of fragrant rose petals for you to follow.</p>
<p>If you are single and unattached, you have a superb chance of meeting a new person who you will want to know better. If you are attached or married, this new moon on November 30 will help you to enjoy the love you have found and nurtured. All this will happen just in time for the kick-off of the festive, ultra-social holiday season. Are you excited yet? I am excited for you!</p>
