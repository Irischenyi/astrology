        <p>Dear Aquarius, your career is about to offer you a major breakthrough. On November 1 you’ll be greeted with the new moon in Scorpio, 10 degrees, and this new moon could bring a landmark event in your career. If you are hoping to get a new job—one that is truly represents a step up from the one you had previously—this is the moment you have waited to see.</p>
<p>You only get one new moon each year in this sector of professional advancement poised at the top of your chart. It is where the industry or community will begin to view you in a new, brighter light, for this is the place in your horoscope that will eventually reflect your greatest contribution to society in your lifetime.</p>
<p>What I love about this new moon November 1 is that your ancient ruler Saturn is currently in your earned income sector (second house) and will be beautifully oriented toward the new moon of November 1. A promotion, new job, or new venture in your own business can now come up, along with a chance to make a more generous salary.</p>
<p>Just to clarify, Saturn was designated as your ruler before Uranus was discovered on March 13, 1781. Once Uranus was discovered, the astrological community came together to decide which zodiac sign Uranus would be most appropriate to rule. Because Uranus is tied to future innovation, experimentation, independence, creativity in high tech, and mathematics and scientific exploration, astrologers worldwide chose Aquarius as the sign most fitting to be ruled by Uranus. A ruling planet will always be given extra weight and importance in that sign’s horoscope. Modern astrologers look at both Saturn and Uranus when deciding your Aquarius forecast.</p>

        <p>Turning your attention back to this influential November 1 new moon, keep in mind that this cheerful new moon will affect you for as long as five months. It will be strongest, however, for the first seven to 10 days of November. This means that if you are looking for a job that will represent more responsibility, influence, and power—along with better compensation—re-double your efforts now to find it. Saturn’s friendly attitude to this new moon and Sun indicates that you can bolster your feeling of job security and create financial stability by being assertive in early November.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the full moon, November 15, in Taurus at 24 degrees, which will bring your attention to your home, family, and perhaps other real estate you may own or rent. Expect sudden and unexpected changes to culminate in your domestic condition. Will those changes be positive or negative? It’s hard to say because the trademark of Uranus makes it impossible to forecast ahead of time. This full moon may cause changes in your family or to you residence or other property you own or rent or hope to sell. You need to keep your schedule light as you might have to drop what you’re doing and refocus on the matter that comes up.</p>
<p>Even though you will be busy and distracted with the matter that arises at the full moon November 15, you will also need to focus on family members, such as your little children (if you have them) or the care of an older beloved relative, such as a parent. You will have a lot on your plate, but you’ve been in this type of position before, and you know you can handle it all. But wait—you have some very big help from Pluto.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the coming 20 years, you can turn yourself into a force to be reckoned with.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Indeed, Pluto will reach out to this full moon to help you. No matter how daunting the situation that comes up, realize you have help. Pluto is powerful, and Pluto is the planet you want on your side while you are going through a transition or when you need to find ideas to fix a situation that emerges out of the blue.</p>
<p>Saturn will send a hard square to this full moon, so it does seem that you will have to cover an expense at this time, and it could be large and difficult to pay. Still, as said, you have Pluto on your side, and Pluto being a financial planet, you may be able to qualify for a bank loan or receive money from a government program, if you send an application, that may have been designed to help people in a situation precisely like yours.</p>
<p>Pluto could also bring help from the company you work for—there is some indication that a VIP may be able to help you find the money you need. You may be granted a cash advance, or you may be able to get your year-end bonus delivered a little early.</p>
<p>You will also have support from a family member who sees the need to offer you a hand. If no one offers, ask for help. I do see that you could find a sympathetic family member who would want to help you in any way they can.</p>
<p>It is also possible that this full moon might not be all that difficult to handle. It may be that you are “simply” moving house, or renovating, and each of these activities is stressful in its own right! Either project can turn out to be expensive and require a bit more money than you originally estimated. All will work out—the smart people are betting on you.</p>

        <p>Get as much done as you can early in November for little wild-child Mercury will go retrograde on November 25 until December 15. This will obviously interfere with holiday shopping and shipping. I suggest you buy the electronics you want to give now and not wait for Black Friday or Cyber Monday sales, which will fall within Mercury’s retrograde. It is never wise to buy anything with an electronic chip inside when Mercury is retrograde. (That includes automobiles—don’t buy a car or anything expensive while Mercury naps!) You best option during Mercury retrograde for gift-giving is to send a gift card by FedEx, UPS, DHL, or Express Mail of USPS, all of which use tracking numbers.</p>
<p>To make life a little more complicated, Mercury’s big brother Mars is going retrograde too, from December 6 to February 23. Mars teaches us how to compete well and affects us mainly in the business and athletic arenas. I suggest you not launch any new ventures during Mars retrograde, and certainly do not open the doors of your new business during this coming 11-week period.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to some headline news that is happening on November 19 that will be very positive for you.</p>
<p>Pluto will move into Aquarius.</p>
<p>Pluto had given you a brief preview of this coming trend earlier this year, from January 20 to September 1, but now he will remain in your sign nearly 20 years—until January 2044!</p>

        <p>This will put you in a very powerful position as the sign designated to be the leader of much of the coming changes in society. There will be both humanitarian and social changes and corresponding developments in science and technology, including A.I., virtual reality, augmented reality, robot creation, improvements to deal with climate change, and so much more. How and where you decide to devote your time will be your choice. Get ready, dear Aquarius. As the leader of the coming two decades, it will be the Aquarians’ world, and the rest of us will be eager to live in it.</p>
<p>After a month filled with career, property, family decisions, and headline news about Pluto’s move to your own sign, you will be ready for some relaxation and fun. The universe agrees and is sending you a gorgeous new moon November 30 in Sagittarius, 10 degrees, to influence the weeks to come.</p>
<p>You are due to enjoy an ultra-social period, just in time to celebrate the coming holiday season. Action Mars will be beautifully oriented to that new moon from your seventh house of marriage and partnership. This suggests your spouse or steady sweetheart will eagerly join you in all the festive activities you will be invited to.</p>

        <p>If you are not attached, you must circulate because you have good-fortune Jupiter in your fifth house of truelove, a place Jupiter took up on May 25 this year and will stay until June 9, 2025. It’s been 12 years since you have had this superior help from benefic Jupiter. At the end of November into December, your friends will be golden for you and, if you press them a little, will make an introduction to a possible new romantic interest. Try—you’ll never know until you do.</p>
<p>The new moon November 30 will affect you for months, although the first two weeks of December will be especially dazzling. You will have plenty of invitations to join friends at brunches, lunches, and dinners and gala gallery openings, parties, or open-house gatherings. In fact, you might decide to give a holiday party of your own in December, a marvelous idea. I suggest you give your party on Saturday, December 14—it will make quite a hit!</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may also join a charity fundraiser or humanitarian activity to help make the world a better place. The compassionate need to help others is almost always found deep within the Aquarian heart.</p>
<p>All Aquarians will enjoy the new moon of November 30. If your birthday falls on January 29, plus or minus five days, you will get a double dip of pleasure. The same is true if you have Aquarius rising or your natal moon in Aquarius at 10 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. Take a look at your chart to see if you have any planet in Aquarius, Libra, Gemini, Aries, Leo, or Sagittarius at 10 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. If you have one, that planet will be a fairy godmother to you.</p>
<p>You seem to have it all, dear Aquarius—career recognition, developments that could bring closure in regard to home and family, and plenty of social activity due at holiday time next month thanks to the happy new moon November 30. That adds up to a good balance, and lots to do.</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>If you are serious about getting ahead in your career, this month could mark an important point where opportunity comes knocking quickly after the new moon arrives November 1. The Sun and moon will meet at the pinnacle of your chart, indicating you may soon be up for a highly responsible job that will come along with quite a bit of influence. If you are self-employed, start to pitch high-level, prestigious brands, for you could easily bring one in this month as a client. Action Mars, the energy planet, has been in your work-a-day sector since early September, revealing that both at home and at work you’ve been fiercely busy, and your work is about to add up to something big.</p>
<p>Not interested in a new promotion or taking on more responsibly? You have free will, and if this is not the right time to be thinking about getting a better job than the one you had, you can sit out this trend. For example, if you have a new baby, you might not want to take on more in your life! Astrology is not destiny—you get to choose how to use the influences that I report to you.</p>
<p>Making progress in your career was challenging last year in 2023 with the full moon in May in your prestigious professional sector and in November with the new moon in the same part of your chart. This year’s aspects are much stronger and more supportive with one exception—while you will find salary and fees acceptable, benefits seem to be lacking or lackluster due to a conflict between Uranus and Mercury.</p>
<p>Even so, you may be able to turn the tables on this situation brought to you at the new moon November 1, thanks to a golden triangle of planets creating harmony. Planets will link your performance at work (Mars) and your imagination and creativity (Neptune), as well as boost your standing in the company, community, or industry (Mercury). VIPs clearly want you in their corner, and if you ask, they may be willing to give you some of the responsibilities and benefits you feel you deserve. It would be worthwhile to present your case. Finances, either through benefits, salaries, fees, royalties, or commissions all show a major uptick for you in mid-month.</p>

        <p>Activities at home regarding your living space or other property you own will take your attention at the full moon, November 15. If your physical space is fine as is, and you are not thinking about giving it an upgrade, then it will be a family member who needs attention. The full moon will be conjunct Uranus, so something highly unusual and unexpected will occur. Do your best to have a flexible, uncluttered agenda at that time because you may need to rapidly direct your attention to what’s going on—hold off any business or personal travel at mid-month, too.</p>
<p>Remarkably, you will again get help from Pluto, now about to move into Aquarius on November 19, just after the full moon. You will be alert and firing on all cylinders, directing others and confidently dealing with the situation. In the coming 20 years, you can turn yourself into a force to be reckoned with, if that’s a goal—Pluto can make you quite powerful and wealthy. You will have to be part of this trend and work toward that goal, but you can if it is your dream.</p>
<p>At the start of the month, Mars and Pluto will be at loggerheads, and that suggests that a person whose support you need will be demanding, possibly in an attempt to bully or manipulate you into accepting his dictates. You will have to handle this situation with delicacy for you do need the support of this person despite his unpleasant demeaner. Although the aspect will be most prevalent at the start of November, Mars is slowing his orbit, so you may tangle with this person on and off all month. By December, however, things will improve, and that person will seem not to be a factor any longer.</p>
<p>The new moon of November 30 will officially kick off the holiday party scene for you, and suddenly your calendar will fill up with invitations from friends. It will be fun to see them and to temporarily let go of everyday cares. Better days are to come, and you will be able to sense this by month’s end. Next month you will be gloriously free and ready to lift your glass of champagne to the New Year.</p>
