        <p>If life has been a bit slow, and you found you were tapping your foot hoping that things would pick up, you will soon get your wish. This month’s first new moon will appear immediately on November 1 in Scorpio, 10 degrees, and light up your sixth house of work projects. You like it best when everything is moving fast, and you should receive an interesting assignment (or a flurry of them) just after this new moon arrives.</p>
<p>This is a sparkly new moon because Saturn, the planet that encourages you to work hard and take on additional responsibility, will be beautifully supportive of this new moon on November 1. With Saturn currently traveling through your solar tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement, the taskmaster planet is testing your ability to devote yourself fully to your job because your reputation is at stake. Saturn teaches that the victories and goals you capture during his transits are worth the effort.</p>
<p>This tells me that if you give this particular assignment your all, you can form a strong and lasting bond with your client or, if you work for others, your supervisor. You have been hosting Saturn in your career sector since March 2023, and you are about halfway through this trend—Saturn will leave your prestigious career sector in February 2026. At that time the pressure you might be feeling now will come off because you will have proven your talent, determination, work ethic, and creativity.</p>
<p>The full moon on November 15 (influential for five days) that will appear in Taurus, 24 degrees, may bring up someone’s hidden agenda or a secret they have kept from you. This full moon will be conjunct Uranus, so the news might surprise or rattle you. Even so, keep in mind that by revealing this information, the universe will be protecting you.</p>

        <p>At the same time Uranus in late Taurus will reach out to Pluto in a supremely positive way. Pluto will be in the last degrees of Capricorn and your financial eighth house, so you could receive a hefty sum from a job you are just about to finish up. Uranus’ beam to Pluto suggests that you may be given a flattering feature story in the press about your recent achievements, which would come complete with a photo or filmed interview of you. Overall, this is a beneficial full moon!</p>
<p>This month will end with a new moon in Sagittarius, 10 degrees, on November 30, which will open up possibilities in regard to a new partnership that you may enter quite soon. Many couples get engaged just prior to the holidays, so perhaps that’s you—it will be fun to share your plans when your family is gathered together, perhaps at the dinner table. Some Gemini will get engaged, others will wed, and still others will use this energy to form a successful business alliance or collaboration.</p>
<p>You might hire a new person to help you in a one-to-one confidential way, such as a lawyer who specializes in an area you need or an accountant, bookkeeper, publicist, social media director, or other expert. This individual could be a decorator or party planner—you get the idea.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you do your part and work with Pluto’s occasionally challenging demands, you are about to be transformed into a powerhouse, dear Gemini.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Alternatively, at this November 30 new moon you may hire a new housekeeper, nanny, or personal assistant. Since Saturn will be in hard angle to the Sun and new moon, there’s work to be done, but with Jupiter partnering with the Sun and new moon, while Mars will be in gorgeous angle to both, you should have a successful outcome. All this action will be located in your seventh house, which is the horoscope’s zone of marriage and all serious commercial partnerships—it is essentially a contractual sector. (We don’t think of marriage as a deal with a contract, but as funny as that might sound, at its core, it is. You do sign papers directly after the wedding ceremony.)</p>
<p>Make this month work for you. We are heading into a very slow period, beginning when your ruler Mercury will retrograde from November 25 to December 15. This is sure to create challenges for your holiday shopping—be sure you buy presents for your loved ones that they truly want. The idea of gift-giving is not to have just “something” under the tree but a thoughtful item that will thrill your recipient.</p>
<p>Buying electronics is especially harrowing during a Mercury retrograde period, so you would be better off picking up a gift card from a retailer that your recipient likes to frequent. This means Black Friday and Cyber Monday may not bring you luck. Shop earlier.</p>
<p>If you purchase a gift card, photocopy its front and back so that you have the serial number, write the amount you choose, and put the name of the person you are giving it to on the photocopy in case the recipient misplaces it. Murphy’s law (completely appropriate for Mercury retrograde) will be in full effect—namely, “if it can happen, it will happen (sooner or later).”</p>

        <p>Here is a major complication—Mercury’s big brother Mars will also go retrograde, but for a much longer time period, from December 6 to February 23. Mars is the action planet that teaches you how to compete well, but when he is sleeping in retrograde, you will sense his absence, and just about everything in business and relationships will seem harder to accomplish. For this reason, settle as much as you can in early November.</p>
<p>As I’ve said, Mercury will go direct on December 15, but he will not be back to a full, healthy state until January 2. Mars will go direct February 23, but the Red Planet will not be back to former strength until April 30. You won’t lose any competitive advantage—every one of us (of every sign) will be in the same boat.</p>
<p>I hesitate to tell you this, but I might as well drop the other shoe. Venus, which retrogrades rarely, will be out of commission and retrograde from March 1 to April 12 and will not be back to full function until May 16.</p>
<p>Use the first four months of 2025 to review past events and projects, and decide what worked and what did not. Gear up to launch in mid-to-late May.</p>
<p>The one bright shining star is that Jupiter in Gemini, retrograde since October 9, will go direct on February 4, 2025, and you will be protected quite a bit by Jupiter during this slow period. If you feel Jupiter has not delivered the gift you expected, you will be happy to see a major change in Jupiter’s support in 2025 from February 23 through June 9 when he will be super strong and fully supportive of you.</p>

        <p>As you see, I cannot look at just one planet—I make a determination of all the planets’ actions, and having Jupiter in your own sign, Gemini, is major. Jupiter will protect you in ways many other signs won’t have during those first months of 2025.</p>
<p>One last note—Pluto will re-enter Aquarius on November 19, after having given you a preview of this transit from January 20 to September 1 this year. Now Pluto is unpacking his bags and is set to stay in Aquarius for a whopping (nearly) 20 years, until January 19, 2044.</p>
<p>Gemini born early in the sign will be the first to feel this energy (or if you have 0 to 3 degrees of any planet in your natal chart in Gemini, Libra, or Aquarius) because Pluto is about to quietly help you transform your life into the vision you have for yourself. Pluto will make you strong and resilient, but you also need to do your part and work with Pluto’s occasionally hard demands. It’s all going to be worth it—you are about to be transformed into a powerhouse, dear Gemini.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>With the new moon of November 1 in Scorpio, if you are self-employed, you may gain an important new client with an interesting project. If you work for others, business will be brisk now. VIPs will be impressed with your efforts—Saturn is well aspected to this new moon, so this assignment may lead to bigger and even better things later.</p>

        <p>If you are looking for a job, this new moon will allow you to find a permanent or part-time position like the one you had before, but admittedly, this opportunity won’t represent a step up. Taking a role on the same level as the one you had may be fine with you for the time being, especially if you have something going on in your life that requires your attention. No matter what your situation is, you can find work in the first half of November.</p>
<p>Your ruler Mercury recently received a hard glance from Uranus last month on October 30, an aspect you might still be feeling during the first days of November. Be sure you know what your client or boss wants you to do as you may be confused, possibly because the directive keeps shifting or being described to you ambiguously. Ask as many questions as you need to, and summarize in your own words the work you will have to complete as you understand it. Mercury also rules Gemini’s fourth house of home and family, so at the very start of the month, keep an eye on all that is happening there, too.</p>
<p>The new moon on November 1 will also provide you with the impetus to improve your overall level of fitnessin the weeks to come. If you have not had your annual physical, this new moon will give you the time to do it. Studies show that people who consult a doctor regularly live longer, so you certainly would want to make that appointment a priority.</p>
<p>The full moon on November 15 in Taurus has unpredictable Uranus adding gyrations to your income or savings. If you plan to buy something expensive in early November, you might want to hold back or wait and see what comes up by the middle of the month. Delay that purchase until late December (after December 15, or even later, if possible).</p>

        <p>Since the November 15 full moon will light your twelfth house of secrets, you may learn something that someone has concealed from you. Alternatively, you could hear a piece of gossip that shocks you because it might include your name. Your twelfth sector is the house of secret enemies, so take what you learn and find a way to protect yourself. You will come across this information for a reason—I suspect it’s an early warning to allow you to head things off so that you can remain safe and secure.</p>
<p>When shopping for holiday gifts, start by buying toys for the children on your list—with Mercury due to go retrograde soon (November 25 to December 15), inventory will be low, and you will want to avoid being told that a much-wanted item is sold out. For adults, you will be far safer purchasing gift cards. Big box stores will have sales on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but with Mercury retrograde, shopping will be risky—a gift card will be a more reliable option. If you do buy gift cards, photocopy each one on both sides, and write the name of the person who you will send it to along with the amount of money it contains. If the card gets lost in the mail, or the recipient forgets where he put it, you can solve that problem in a flash by stopping the original card and getting a new one issued.</p>
<p>Mars, the action planet, will start to retrograde on December 6 next month, to stay retrograde until February 23. This month your ruler little Mercury, seeing his big brother Mars preparing to be out of phase, will go retrograde first from November 25 until December 15, overlapping with the time Mars will be napping.</p>

        <p>Many people promise their love at holiday time, so the new moon of November 30 (Sagittarius) may coax you to accept a proposal (or give one). You might get engaged or even married soon. (Avoid doing sowhile Mercury is retrograde though). This new moon in Sagittarius on November 30 will encourage you to couple up and plan for the future. If you are already wed, this could be a wonderful time to set new goals for the New Year—you would be finding ways to make and save more from your wedding. If you are not ready or interested in marriage, then use this new moon for business purposes, and hire a new partner whom you want to collaborate with closely. You will see your actions pay off at this time.</p>
<p>As you see, due to the coming retrograde planets, the pace of life will slow down considerably for many people. For Mars, life will not fully return to a lively tempo until April 30 next year. This might be due to supply chain problems, low corporate budgets, or a mild recession, or the slowdown could only be localized to certain industries or cities. In 2025 Venus will retrograde March 1 to April 12—not a time to make any radical or expensive changes to your appearance (especially any dermatological improvements). I suggest you not marry during Venus retrograde either.</p>
<p>Life will normalize by early May 2025, and this will be true no matter which political party is voted into office. In the process of all your own financial decisions, make sure you launch your most important projects in early November, no later. Looking ahead, you have nothing to worry about because you will see generous money heading your way by June 2025. Also, you will have strong Jupiter at your side, which is a powerful protection. Stay optimistic—better days are due.</p>
