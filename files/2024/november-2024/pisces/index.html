        <p>The month will open with a very broadening emphasis—a new moon in Scorpio, 10 degrees, on November 1. This new moon will help you to travel much more often than usual in the weeks and months ahead and to have more meaningful international relationships. This new moon will open the door for more global opportunities too, so it could work out to be quite exciting.</p>
<p>If you are a writer or producer, this new moon in Scorpio will appear in your solar ninth house, so some of your work will likely produce your best, most lucrative compensation from a company based overseas. Alternatively, the person who is fortunate for you might be based in your own country but born in another nation, and therefore may speak with an accent. The new moon in Scorpio November 1 will blend beautifully with your Pisces water-sign element, so take seriously any opportunities that might arise for you in this area in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>You might be waiting for a visa, immigrant status card, or passport to come through, or you may hope you will be approved for citizenship in a country new to you. If you have not had your interview with the immigration department of the country you hope to enter, or taken an immigration test and need to take one, that appointment is likely to be granted this month. If you are a Pisces or have Pisces rising, your stars are twinkling brightly overhead, so your chances are excellent for seeing progress.</p>

        <p>The ninth house, which is so very favorable for you, will also help you get assignments from the publishing or broadcasting industries. The courts and justice systems are ruled by your active ninth house too, so legal matters may favor you. You might start a case, but it is also possible you will file for a trademark or patent. Finally, your pursuit for higher education is also covered by this mind-expanding ninth house, so your interview or interactions with university professors and personnel will go smoothly. All the areas listed will be encouraged by this new moon and likely will be beneficial for you.</p>
<p>Saturn will be active at this new moon and be supremely supportive. For example, you could be setting up a solid foundation with international clients and building your relationship for future months and years.</p>
<p>Pluto is another key planet that is about to take a main role at this new moon, and Pluto is a heavy-duty financial planet. On the November 1 new moon, Pluto will work beautifully with Uranus, so you could make surprisingly generous money from the business you do now, especially in foreign markets, the media, or college markets. Uranus and Pluto will not make an exact aspect until July 2026, but these two planets are now close enough (within 4 degrees of a perfect trine) for you to feel their proximity and benefit from it.</p>
<blockquote><p>You will have a front row seat to the monumental changes brought by Pluto’s move to Aquarius, and chances are you will be exhilarated by all that is yet to come.</p></blockquote>

        <p>The last time Pluto and Uranus cooperated like this was 1921-1922, although there was a similar, but a milder, less spectacular aspect that took place from 1995 to 1997—and since then there has been no friendly contact between these two planets until now.</p>
<p>This month, in a remarkable set of contacts, Pluto will also work with Neptune, your ruler, and help you get assignments that are creative and deeply satisfying. In turn, Neptune will signal Uranus. It’s rare to see these titans of the solar system speaking to each other and willing to “step off their pedestals” and “come down to Earth” to help us earthlings succeed. You have enough powerful aspects to see exciting developments, so take a close look at any opportunity that may come up in the days that follow the new moon November 1.</p>
<p>I need to put a finer point on this discussion—there is a golden triangle that is about to appear simultaneously with the new moon November 1. Technically called a Grand Trine in water signs, it will happen independently of the new moon November 1, but its timing makes it part the new moon’s package, bringing even more benefits to you. Let me describe this golden triangle (or Grand Trine).</p>
<p>There are (as you know) three points to a shimmering golden triangle and the planets on those points, working together, create exquisite harmony. First, there is Mars in Cancer, based in your fifth house of true love and creative expression, making you eager to use your imagination and originality. Second, you have Saturn in Pisces in your solar first house, which describes your personality and identity, and Saturn reflects your enormous self-discipline to get the details “just so.”</p>

        <p>Both Mars in Cancer and Neptune in Pisces are linked to each other, and both will contact Mercury in Scorpio at the third point of the triangle. Mercury is in your ninth house, ruling all the things you and I have been discussing in this forecast so far—distant travel, international relationships, import-export, legal matters, luck in regard to your pursuit of higher education, and additional benefits from publishing and broadcasting companies.</p>
<p>Mercury is the planet that brings in news, negotiations, contracts, and possibly travel, so with such harmonious aspects, you are likely to hear about a new assignment in the first 10 days of November. Mars in Cancer suggests that any assignment will be highly creative and right up your ally, and Neptune in Pisces agrees—this project seems tailor-made for you, an important project. If you do well, this project could become the jewel in your crown and bring more interesting and well-paying work.</p>
<p>A water-sign Grand Trine will also sharpen you intuition and may bring you interesting hunches and prophetic dreams that you should pay attention to, for this is being given to you to help you. This Grand Trine connecting the three water signs will give you a kind of night vision that will allow you to instinctively and successfully sum up a situation that is still somewhat ambiguous—but this has never worried you. Your intuition has always proved stronger than most other signs and can allow you to make thoughtful decisions when all the facts are still uncertain, either because they are not all available or simply unknown—relying on your instincts is always spot on.</p>
<p>All Pisces stand to benefit from the November 1 new moon. The Pisces who will do the very best are those who have a birthday that falls within five days, plus or minus, of February 28 or who have their natal moon or rising sign in Pisces within five degrees of 10 degrees. Also, if you have a natal planet in your horoscope in Pisces, Cancer, Scorpio, Taurus, Virgo, or Capricorn at this same position (10 degrees plus or minus five), then you will benefit from that planet.</p>

        <p>Now let’s move on to talk about the full moon November 15 in Taurus, 24 degrees. This lunation will also be about travel, but travel that would typically not take you as far as the earlier new moon might do (discussed above).</p>
<p>This full moon will also accent negotiation and contracts and underscore your ability to communicate diplomatically and gracefully, which, as a Pisces, you do so well. You might take a short trip, and as your solar third house of travel is ruled by Venus, which is currently in your tenth house of career progress, your trip, if you take it, would likely be to do business with a high-profile client.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may be finishing a manuscript or be asked to give a speech. If you are a lawyer, you may be completing your opening or closeting statements to the jury for a court case. You might be negotiating a contact and hope to sign between November 15 and 20. (Try to trade signatures closer to November 15, if that works for you.) The unusual part about this full moon is that Uranus will conjoin the full moon, so something unplanned and unanticipated will come up, and when this happens you will have to think quickly on your feet.</p>
<p>In a completely different manifestation of this full moon, you may see a side of your sweetheart that you did not know existed, a moment you wished you had not seen. This could lead to a disagreement or heated discussion. In fact, if you are living together, either you or your significant other may want to move out. Remain calm, and say as little as possible until you have all the facts.</p>

        <p>At the same time as the full moon, Mars will oppose Pluto, a possibly explosive aspect where someone might come on as quite demanding or domineering. Mars is currently in your sixth house of work projects, so you may have a situation at work that you’ll need to delicately handle. You may be able to cobble together an agreeable compromise because Neptune, your ruler, will be in superb conversation with Pluto in Capricorn, the Sun in Scorpio, and the full moon and Uranus in Taurus. Neptune will come to the rescue by keeping your reputation sterling and doing the job that pleases clients and other VIPs. You are holding many aces, so you can handle this tough aspect while you create a successful project. Everyone wins.</p>
<p>In this busy month there is just one more item to add to your report. Pluto will make his historic move into Aquarius on November 19 for the first time since the American and French Revolutions. Pluto did first enter Aquarius earlier this year on January 20, and then retreated on September 1 to finish the preview. Pluto then tied up loose ends in Capricorn and now is returning to, and will remain in, Aquarius until January 19, 2044, a period of nearly 20 years.</p>
<p>Pluto will move into your solar twelfth house, which is the house that Pisces naturally “owns”—it is a place of deep creativity and imagination, found so deep within your subconscious that you will be able to express artistic ideas of breathtaking beauty and originality but will have no idea where the spark came from—the answer will be from deep within your subconscious.</p>
<p>Pluto in Aquarius will help you find ways to harness A.I. and delve into the digital world, perhaps by designing digital art, music, games, interactive books, and other forms, surprising yourself as much as you will your adoring audience.</p>

        <p>It will be a fantastic period to live through, for the entire look and feel of society will change. You will have a front row seat, and chances are you will be exhilarated by all that is yet to come. Will problems crop up? Yes, and society will deal with those dilemmas. All changes bring with them drawbacks, just as the Industrial Revolution brought pollution, child labor, and sweatshops, so laws and guardrails will be constructed to deal with what will come up during this change, just as society has done in the past.</p>
<p>The possible proliferation of misinformation through video and audio is one of the most troubling features of A.I., but fortunately Neptune in Pisces, which showed the dangers of illusion, is on its way out. Neptune will finally leave Pisces in January 2026, not to return again in our lifetime.</p>
<p>With Pluto’s move this month to his new sign on November 19, the Age of Aquarius will be firmly in place. The inventions to come will be such that we cannot yet imagine. It will be a thrilling time to be alive.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You might be yearning to schedule a bit of travel before the holidays, and if so, the new moon of November 1 in Scorpio will help you make your travel dreams come true. If activities happening at home require you to stay back and not travel, you will still feel the invigorating influence of foreign culture strongly during the month’s first half. You might have a client abroad and work together through email, telephone, express courier services, and Zoom on the import-export of ideas, goods, or services.</p>

        <p>Other areas of gain ruled by your ninth house (quite lit up for you now) might include the college market (or your own pursuit of an advanced degree), legal matters, and those involving publishing and broadcasting projects.</p>
<p>Mars will be activating your work-a-day sector from November 3 to January 6, so you will be busy at that time. It seems that if you do travel, you would be scheduling a business trip, but you could find time for some fun time off, too. The new moon of November 1 in Scorpio will be a good time for you—your productivity will be high, and you will have a strong sense of pride in the work you do.</p>
<p>A golden triangle will appear in the first week of November, linking your ruler Neptune in Pisces and your first house of personality and identity (in other words, “you”) to Mars in your assignment sector and to Mercury in your ninth house, the part of your chart that is currently busier than a beehive of activity, ruling, as said, international relationships and travel, legal, media, and higher education.</p>
<p>Simultaneous to all this professional activity is an ongoing emphasis on your home or other property you hope to buy, sell, or rent—excellent things are happening there. You may be renovating, shopping for a new piece of furniture, upgrading your décor, decluttering, painting, or just fixing things all around. You are hosting good-fortune Jupiter in your home and family sector for the first time in 12 years, a trend that will continue until June 9, 2025. Home will be your favorite place to be, and you can count on strong family support, too. You may experience happiness because a family member has had (or soon will have) a baby, drawing everyone in your clan together to welcome the new tiny life.</p>

        <p>At the full moon November 15 (plus five days) you may be finishing up an important assignment or concluding the terms of a deal or contractual matter. Pluto will be active, so if you are self-employed or are in sales, it will be clear that you can make money if you come to agreement with the deal that’s on the table.</p>
<p>Mercury will retrograde in Sagittarius from November 25 to December 15, so it will be mainly career matters that will temporarily move into limbo or confusion. It would be best to sign any paperwork in the first two weeks of November, for we always feel the slowdown of Mercury well in advance of the official retrograde date. If you want to buy any expensive electronic items, do so now—don’t wait to take advantage of Black Friday or Cyber Monday this month. A bargain is not a bargain if the recipient of your gift doesn’t like the make or model you bought. You might do better with gift cards.</p>
<p>There is another bit of a complication—Mercury’s big brother Mars will also go retrograde, starting December 6 until February 23, a period of a little over 11 weeks. Even after Mars goes direct, it will take him time to become as strong as he was before the retrograde—that will happen by April 30.</p>
<p>Mars is the natural ruler of your solar second house of income, so payments from others who owe you may take longer than usual to arrive. If you are self-employed, you might want to ask for half of your fee in advance if you are doing an assignment and hope to be paid within one month.</p>

        <p>This month holds a second new moon on November 30, and that one will set your name in lights professionally. It will be as if you can do no wrong. In the days and weeks that follow November 30 into December, you are likely to hear important career news. You will have your chance to elevate your standing in the industry and your community and to engender admiration and respect from influential people.</p>
<p>This is a time when your work will be lauded and appreciated, so you may get the kind of publicity you used to dream about. It appears the venture that you will be working on this month can help you showcase your talent in a new and compelling way and lead you to more interesting projects in future years, too.</p>
<p>The Pisces who will find a way to benefit from this new moon are those with a birthday that falls March 1, plus or minus five days. If you have Pisces rising or your natal moon in Pisces at 10 degrees, plus or minus five degrees, you will also benefit . Have a look at your natal chart and to see if you have any natal planets in Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces, Taurus, Virgo, or Capricorn—if you can find one (or more!) from 5 to 15 degrees, that planet will be your benefactor and bring you quite a bit of luck.</p>
