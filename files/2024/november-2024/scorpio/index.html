        <p>The universe has planned a lovely birthday gift for you—a new moon in Scorpio, 10 degrees, on November 1. This new moon is a peach, and it will give you lots of opportunities in the weeks and months to come. You can direct this energy any way that you please because it will appear in Scorpio, your first house of personality and identity.</p>
<p>Every month I tell you which area of life is going to be your focus, which is based partly on the area where the new moon falls. But when you have a new moon in your own sign, you can use that new moon to improve any area of your life. You will be given an open gift card. Where in your life would you like to make the most progress? What would you like to achieve in the coming birthday year? You may have been uprooted or turned upside down due to some of the eclipses—the wild cards of astrology—in 2022 and 2023.</p>
<p>I love that Saturn in Pisces will be perfectly supportive to this new moon in Scorpio on November 1. That tells me the actions you take will have weight and long-term stability. You are a fixed sign and don’t like constant change—you are hardwired to crave things to stay “as is” unless there is a good reason to change, but alas, life does not always work that way.</p>
<p>If you are single and hoping to find romance, you might find love in early November. Love is serious to you, as evidenced by Saturn in your fifth house. This month Saturn will be in a highly supportive angle to the new moon, so you could find genuine, lasting love. Lately, you have been mindful of using your time well and not squandering it with someone who is not suitable for a committed relationship.</p>

        <p>The fact that Saturn is in your fifth house also suggests that you might make a decision on behalf of a child, and that will likely work out well if it happens. This same house also rules pregnancy and birth, so you may make a decision about whether or not to add a new baby to your family.</p>
<p>If you don’t have children and are not interested in having a baby, you may alternatively make a decision concerning a person you are dating seriously under this new moon (and the weeks that follow it). You may decide to bond more closely. If you’re working on a creative project, this one seems to have special significance, and it could become a jewel in your crown.</p>
<p>Every Scorpio will have something to cheer about at this lovely new moon in Scorpio on November 1 (and in the weeks to come). The closer your birthday is to November 1, the more you will feel its benefits. This will also be true if you have Scorpio rising or your natal moon in Scorpio at 10 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. Also look at your chart to see if you have a natal planet in Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces, Taurus, Virgo, or Capricorn within five degrees of 10 degrees—if you have a planet that meets these qualifications, take note of it, for that planet will work very hard on your behalf.</p>

        <p>Your career is creating colorful fireworks in the night sky. In August you may have advanced in a new, high-level direction, for you had a powerful new moon in your career sector. Additionally, starting November 3, you have Mars, one of your two rulers, lighting up your career sector until January 6.</p>
<p>Pluto will take the lead at this new moon, but Pluto will also be directly opposed to Mars. These are Scorpio’s two ruling planets, and they are at odds. This suggests quite a bit of tension between the needs of your clients or boss versus the needs of family or something happening with your home. You will feel a little bit between a rock and a hard place, so ask for help if you need it. For example, have backup if your nanny suddenly cancels. Something is going wrong at the office or at home, and both areas seem to want your complete attention.</p>
<p>The more prepared you are with backup, the easier your position will be. Admittedly, it’s hard to anticipate these kinds of situations. We all go through them at times, but with each episode we become stronger, and you will vow not to get stuck like this again—there are solutions, but you simply need to know to plan for them.</p>
<p>Even with the push-pull of Pluto and Mars, this is a solidly good new moon. This new moon includes a water-sign glittering golden triangle, linking Mercury in your first house of identity and all that is important to you to Neptune in your fifth house of love and children. The third leg of the triangle touches Mars in Cancer in your ninth house of broadcasting, publishing, overseas trade, and international relationships, as well as the import and export of goods, services, and ideas. One of those areas will protect you. A water-sign trine is supreme for you—it will sharpen your intuition and help you unlock the mystery I have proposed to you.</p>

        <p>After November 3 you will have the privilege of hosting Mars in your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement—the area of your chart that will shower you with professional help. You may soon enjoy some enviable publicity, or you could be about to start a new position. Mars will give you the motivation to compete well, and it also will raise your profile so that VIPs in your industry notice your good work. Mars in Leo will also make it easier for you to get your foot in the door with high-level, influential VIPs, people who you need to see to garner their support.</p>
<p>Work hard in the first two weeks of this month because there are some tricky situations coming up—Mercury will retrograde in Sagittarius from November 25 to December 15. This will slow the course of commerce, transportation, and shipping, and will bring all kinds of complications to holiday shopping, including Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales. You would be wise to shop before those events, and fortunately, retailers have been staging sales and deals starting as far back as October.</p>
<p>There is more news, however. Your ruler Mars will go retrograde from December 6, 2024, to February 23, 2025, and that will make it harder to be productive and generate new business. Instead, this can be a time to review past projects and decide what worked and what didn’t as you plan for the coming year. Mars won’t be back to full function until April 30, so you would be wise to use November to your full advantage until November 25 when Mercury turns retrograde. (Keep a space of days prior to November 25—you will start to feel things slow down at least a week or more prior to this date.)</p>
<p>After thinking about your own life at the new moon, you will turn your attention to your partner. That person might be your spouse or steady sweetheart, or it may be your business partner, agent, expert, or close collaborator in your working life. You may need to attend to this relationship at the full moon in Taurus, 24 degrees, on November 15. This full moon will be influential for an extra five days.</p>

        <p>The full moon on November 15 will orbit tightly with Uranus, making it volatile, which means this person might say or exhibit character qualities that seem to come out of the blue, and they may surprise or shock you. At the same time, Uranus will oppose the Sun. The Sun rules your standing in your career, so this person seems to be connected to your work as a collaborator on a level similar to yours. During this full moon, operative from November 15 to 19, you seem not to like anything this person is saying or doing. It will be easy to get emotional about what you see and hear at this time, but try to stay calm.</p>
<p>I will admit it IS possible that the person in question is a close romantic partner, and since Uranus is the natural ruler of your fourth house of home, your partner may suddenly want to move out. Alternatively, you both might be having problems with your landlord (or something else involving your physical space). Your partner may have a disagreement with your parent that jars you. You could feel tense at this time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the simmering situation at home (namely, the demands of taking care of family while also meeting work needs), which was prevalent as the month opened, isn’t likely to reach a conclusion by the full moon on November 15. You may enter this full moon period feeling a little wrung out because of the many demands on you from seemingly every corner of your life. There seems to be too little time to get everything done, and you might feel a little fragile. If you can hire help, do. You need it. This full moon is coming at a time when you’ve been handling a lot, and you don’t want another person (like your partner) to be added to your list of those who need your attention.</p>
<p>Even so, at the November 15 full moon you will have help from your other ruler Pluto, based in your home sector, and from Neptune from your private love sector (this part of your chart also rules children). It seems you will secure your family’s needs first, making it a priority, and then turn to take care of tasks at work.</p>

        <p>The Scorpios who will feel this November 15 full moon the most will be those born between November 15 and November 20. If you have Scorpio rising or your natal moon in Scorpio within five degrees of 24 degrees (plus or minus), you will feel this full moon as well. It might be good to keep your schedule light and flexible in case you need to drop what you are doing and attend to what comes up. Luckily, the nature of a full moon is to deliver its news and then move on. Full moons bring closure, and they ask for an immediate answer—and then they blow over so you can direct your energy toward other things.</p>
<p>I cannot see everything in your individual chart, so there is always a chance that the full moon will bring exceptionally good news about a partner. I can say that whatever comes up will be something that feels completely unexpected.</p>
<p>This month has a second new moon, so let’s now look at that one. That new moon is due on November 30 in Sagittarius, 10 degrees, and it will light up your second house of earned income.</p>
<p>This one will be a good new moon! Remarkably, Mars will be in the ideal spot to help you from his perch in your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement. Mars is your second ruler, so he has more weight and importance to you than to most other signs. Thanks to Mars’ help, it is quite possible you will get news of an increase in your salary (or a bonus).</p>
<p>Additionally, Jupiter is on the other side of the sky in Gemini, positioned in your other financial house, the eighth house of other people’s money. Good-fortune Jupiter will partner with the November 30 new moon, a good sign of a possible bonus or other perk to come to you, either now or by year’s end. Jupiter is turning you into a money magnet, and he will remain in this rare position until June 9, 2025.</p>

        <p>Jupiter comes to this financial part of your chart every 12 years for one full year (Jupiter started in Gemini back in May 2024). Life can’t always be this sweet, so if you can, put aside some of the money you make, and invest it so that it can multiply to an even bigger number while you sleep.</p>
<p>This year you will truly be luckier than a leprechaun—a real magnet for money. I am not suggesting that you will win money by gambling, but rather by earning your money the old-fashioned way, by working for it. Money may find its way to you in other ways, such as from a court settlement in your favor, a prize winning, an insurance claim you made, or college financial aid or a scholarship—there are many avenues that money may travel to get to you.</p>
<p>In this roller-coaster month, you will be assured that management adores you and has been impressed with how you’ve handled a variety of challenging situations. In fact, you are probably on your client’s or management’s short list of emerging stars to watch. Neptune in Pisces will be in warm conversation with Pluto in Capricorn, and at the same time with Uranus in Taurus. With these big-guy planets on your side, it is clear your imaginative, creative approach to all you do will be a big part of your success.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>On November 1 you will encounter a critical new moon in Scorpio that will push you forward. At almost the same time, on November 3, Mars will enter Leo to light up your tenth house of prestigious career advancement. You have not had Mars in this area of your chart in two years, so this represents a very important and positive time for you to find new opportunities that will allow you to make a name for yourself.</p>

        <p>The first 10 days of November will be your most beneficial, so put the pedal to the metal and press forward, even if you face obstacles. (None are on the horizon, but I cannot see all in your unique chart from where I sit.) Jupiter, the planet of growth, happiness, and good fortune, is still in your eighth house (to stay until June 9, 2025), which suggests that you will be paid well, especially if you are on commission or are due a royalty or bonus. There are other ways money can find a way to you too, but I would rule out gambling. At any rate, you will find your company benefits to be liberal and generous. With Mars at the top of your chart (akin to where the 12 is found on the face of a clock), you will find it easy to meet with highly influential VIPs to present your case.</p>
<p>Tension could mark the period on and near the full moon, which appears November 15 in your opposite sign of Taurus. Wild-child Uranus will conjoin the full moon and directly oppose the Sun. If you and your sweetheart or collaborator in business have not been getting along, and if you would describe the relationship as “hanging by a thread,” that thread could now break, and it might cause a domestic change, with you or your partner moving out. Career news could suddenly go sideways, too. Or if you work in TV or publishing, a client could leave. This is a separating aspect—you will know where the weak link lies.</p>
<p>This will be time to decide how much that partner in love or business means to you. If you have tried to improve the relationship to no avail, you will now likely throw in the towel and give up. If you feel there is a chance to repair the relationship, you may attempt couples therapy or business therapy (yes, there is such a thing).</p>

        <p>In a month, when Murphy’s Law will run rampant (“if anything CAN go wrong, it WILL go wrong”), it appears you will have concerns about money. This will happen on or around the new moon on November 30. Saturn, now in your fifth house of love, children, and creativity, will be in hard angle to the new moon in your second house of earned income. You may be scrambling for money to cover childcare or to buy your child clothing he needs. If you don’t have children, you may encounter a large expense, and you might need to scale back on spending for travel and other pleasures until you can regulate your cash flow.</p>
<p>Mercury will begin to retrograde on November 25 until December 15. Overlapping this period will be Mercury’s big brother Mars turning retrograde too, and that is more concerning because Mars is your ruler. Mars will be retrograde next month from December 6, 2024, until February 23, 2025. This will create a slowdown of life’s normally quick pace, and everyone of every sign will experience the same situation. It may be a comfort to know that everyone will feel a little less productive and that you won’t be at a disadvantage—we’ll all be in the same boat.</p>
<p>On the upside, Mars in your prestigious career sector (tenth house) is in perfect angle to the November 30 new moon in your earned income sector. This is great news, for Mars is your ruler and “counts” more for you than most other signs (along with Aries, also ruled by Mars). This shows that despite any obstacles, you can come out ahead by making money the old-fashioned way—earning it. Mars will still be moving direct and in strong orbit until December 6, so use November’s first two weeks to get things done. Mars’ little brother Mercury will start to slow things down before he goes retrograde November 25 (until December 15).</p>
<p>Your services will be in demand in the marketplace, and it will be up to you to uncover those opportunities. If you look behind every bush and under every rock, you will see that opportunity is right there waiting for you.</p>
