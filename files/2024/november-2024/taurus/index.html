        <p>This could be an important month for a close relationship in your business or romantic life. The new moon on November 1 will appear in Scorpio, 10 degrees, and light your seventh house of serious, committed partnerships—in business or in marriage. New moons herald new beginnings and open up new ways of life, so if you have been dating someone special and feel this partner is “the one,” you may become betrothed in the days and weeks following the new moon.</p>
<p>This is an outstanding new moon, for along with this new moon a golden triangle will appear in the night sky linking Mercury in Scorpio (28 degrees) in your marriage/partnership sector to Mars in Cancer, 29 degrees, in your travel and contractual sector. Both Mercury and Mars will independently beam to unconditional love planet Neptune in Pisces at 28 degrees in your eleventh house of hopes and wishes. These three planets will complete the triangle called a Grand Trine. This is a configuration of supreme harmony. It looks like a decision that you are about to make (or an opportunity to form a serious relationship that comes up) will make you outstandingly happy. If you are already wed, this is still a magical aspect, sure to bring sugar and spice to your marriage.</p>
<p>You can use this aspect for a business commitment too, such as to sign a new agent, lawyer, accountant, publicist, or other person who you will hire to help you get ahead or do things right. (The type of person you are looking for might include a real estate broker or a wedding planner, too.) The best part about this new moon November 1 is that stabilizing Saturn will be in divine angle to the new moon and Sun, indicating your alliance is likely to last a very long time, possibly forever. Saturn is in your house of hopes and wishes (eleventh house), so it seems that the longevity of this relationship is your aim as well.</p>
<p>There are a lot of planetary conversations happening at this time. For example, Uranus, the surprise planet, is in late degrees of Taurus and will be in contact with Mars in late degrees of Cancer in your third house, so you may be taking a trip at this time. Uranus is also beaming friendly vibes to Neptune in Pisces in late degrees, adding a beautiful, pretty veil of romance over all you are doing. Neptune also rules creativity, so if the alliance you are thinking about is for a business venture, it could be associated with the arts or done in collaboration with creative people.</p>

        <p>The full moon on November 15 will be an important one for you—it will fall in Taurus, 24 degrees, so after thinking quite a bit about your partner in love or business, you will turn your attention to your own needs. Within the full moon period November 15 to November 19, something of enormous importance to you personably will come to conclusion or culmination.</p>
<p>Uranus, the planet of all unexpected events, will orbit shoulder-to-shoulder to the full moon, so you will be feeling independent in expressing your thoughts. The moon in your chart is tied to commitments, contracts, communications, and siblings—one of these today may become important at the full moon. Additionally, you may have a problem with housing, for Uranus will oppose the Sun which rules your fourth house of home and family. Keep your eye on your parents, too.</p>
<p>Romantically, Venus will move through Capricorn, a highly compatible place for Venus to be for you, from November 11 to December 7, sure to be a time you’ll feel popular when friends call with invitations. Travel may come up as a possibility and is sure to please you.</p>
<p>At month’s end, the new moon in Sagittarius, 10 degrees, will be a time of getting your financial house in order. If you are preparing to buy property, you may be filling out an application for a pre-approval from your bank. Saturn will keep you realistic, and Mars will see that you get a speedy reply.</p>
<blockquote><p>Venus will be in Capricorn from November 11 to December 7, just in time to have you sparkle at holiday parties. Your charms will be irresistible.</p></blockquote>

        <p>This should have been a good year for increasing your income, the reason why you may be looking into ways to invest—most Taurus prefer investing in real estate. If you say 2024 has not yet been a good year for earnings, Jupiter, the good fortune planet, now in Gemini and your income sector, is set to stay until June 9, 2025, so you have plenty of time to see your fortunes rise.</p>
<p>The new moon November 30 could bring good news about money. It might come from a sale of property, or money may come from family and earmarked for you.</p>
<p>We’re coming into the holiday season, and rambunctious Mercury has decided to create a dust-up. He’ll be going retrograde from November 25 to December 15, so do as much of your holiday shopping as you can early in the month. Mars is set to go retrograde too, from December 6 until nearly the end of February. Everything will slow down during Mars’ retrograde period, so with both Mercury’s and Mars’ retrograde periods overlapping, you’ll need to keep your wits about you through the end of the year.</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>The early part of November will be your best time, personally or professionally, because Saturn, the planet of stability and long-range gains, will be quite active and is beautifully oriented to the new moon of November 1 in Scorpio, 10 degrees. This new moon will light your area of commitment, both in marriage and in business partnerships. You may become engaged or wed soon, or at work you might hire an expert to work closely with in you in a confidential way. Alternatively, you may designate an official partner in your business.</p>
<p>A new moon in the seventh house, as you have, is not mutually exclusive to your personal or business relationships. That is why you can get married and hire a wedding planner (collaborator in business) and a nanny for your small child (in a serious, contractual personal collaborator) all in one month—November. Or you could hire a new attorney with a specialty you need or a new accountant to help calculate any taxes you may owe. The message of the stars to you is clear: Combining forces with another person will likely make for a successful outcome.</p>
<p>There is one aspect to be aware of—Mercury, planet of communication, will be in Scorpio, while at the same time, Uranus, the planet of all things unexpected, now in Taurus, is orbiting in direct opposition, 180-degrees across the sky. Be careful how you communicate feelings and facts, for all that you say and write will be open to interpretation. Your message may not be received in the way you had intended, and instead of bringing harmony, your words might bring on discord.</p>

        <p>Adding another layer to this impending communication scramble is that soon Mercury will be retrograde—from November 25 to December 15. You will feel Mercury’s gradual slowdown approximately 14 days before the official date of the onset of the retrograde. So you might want to consider doing all your most important initiations (including shopping for holiday gifts) early, and no later than November 11.</p>
<p>The full moon of November 15 will switch your attention to your own desires and plans—a matter of enormous personal importance to you will come to fruition at this time. Uranus will conjunct this full moon in Taurus and oppose the Sun in Scorpio, so it appears a close partner, spouse, or collaborator is likely to voice unexpected news that could temporarily rattle you. The Sun rules your home, other property you may own or rent, and also your parents, so keep an eye on home and family areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, the moon rules your domestic condition, and with volatile Uranus conjunct the full moon, this may bring a home or property matter or a developing situation having to do with a member of the immediate family to your attention. News might be unusual, chaotic, and completely unexpected. Fortunately, you are a stable, thoughtful Taurus, known to take your time when given news you don’t expect, so you will slowly sort out your options and choose the best route to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>Another aspect is echoing this trend—Mars will enter Leo and your home sector on November 3, staying until January 6, giving more evidence that something important is going on in your residence, other property, or regarding family. Mars brings noise, so you may move around furniture, make renovations or repairs, or have discussions with family (some of which might be loud). On the other hand, you might be hosting overnight guests or entertaining friends.</p>

        <p>Action Mars will go retrograde next month from December 6 to February 23, and when this happens, the pace of life slows down. Although the end of February is when Mars stops retrograding, it won’t be until April 30 when Mars will have fully worked his way back to a strong, healthy orbit. You might not see a final resolve to all that is going on at home until the end of April, or if you do see progress sooner (possible), you might have to face a few hiccups along the way and find a fix for each little roadblock you encounter. Mars is the action planet, and when he naps in retrograde, life slows down, so you will need more patience as things progress at a snail’s pace.</p>
<p>By the time you get to the end of November (and the new moon in Sagittarius, 10 degrees), you will be motivated to examine and manage your personal finances in the light of recent events and goals. You might be “shopping” for money, such as a mortgage for a new house or a bank loan for a renovation or to order large-scale repairs. Saturn will be in hard angle to that new moon, so it seems you must take these steps to keep you and your family secure. As a Taurus, you like to see your nest egg grow, and you don’t like to spend large amounts, but sometimes all this check writing is not only necessary but beneficial for your future.</p>
<p>If you are not inclined to “settle in,” this new moon may simply urge you to make refinements to your investment portfolio or to see an estate planner to get your affairs in order to protect your family’s security.</p>
<p>Romantically, Venus will be in Capricorn from November 11 to December 7, ushering a time of heightened popularity and fun with friends. Your charms will be irresistible, and if you are single, you might just meet a new, important romantic interest. If you can work in a trip during this period, it would be quite heavenly. Venus is on her way to you, just in time to have you sparkle at holiday parties.</p>
