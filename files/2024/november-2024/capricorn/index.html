        <p>This will be a generally soft, romantic, and fun month, which might sound surprising to you because October was such a strong month for professional decisions, advancement, and matters related to your home and family. Each month the universe strives to bring balance to your life. After a period that emphasized career, home, family, and perhaps some decision-making, you will now move into an easier, breezier month that allows you to exhale and enjoy life.</p>
<p>The new moon in Scorpio, 10 degrees, will arrive immediately on November 1. This new moon will light your sector of hopes and wishes (eleventh house), that magical part of your chart where you’ll be reminded that dreams can indeed come true. You will have time to think about what you would love to achieve in your coming birthday year, which will be upon you as soon as the Sun moves into Capricorn on December 21.</p>
<p>This new moon on November 1 will initiate a very social time for you, when friends will start to call you with news of upcoming holiday parties and get-togethers. You could also be making arrangements with friends to have a quick dinner after work or a leisurely brunch over the weekend. All this social activity will be noticeable directly after the new moon arrives on November 1 and in the weeks ahead. You need time to have fun and relax, so indulge a little.</p>
<p>The part about this new moon that will be so delicious is that your ruling planet Saturn will be sending greetings to the new moon in a heavenly “trine” aspect, which is the best, most harmonious aspect you can wish to see. Saturn will be in your third house, which suggests that you might be hoping to go on a quick trip before the holidays sweep in and take center stage. Short-distance travel will be possible, and it looks as though you may be visiting your sister, brother, or cousin. Pluto will send travel planet Mercury a high-five to help make that trip possible, if you want to go.</p>

        <p>Saturn’s involvement also suggests that an older, mature friend could give you very good advice on a current dilemma this month. New friends (of any age) that you might make now are likely to stay in your life for a long time. Try to get out of the house a little more by attending events, and be open to expanding your circle of acquaintances. You might want to join a charity event, community activity, or humanitarian effort that will bring you in contact with like-minded people. You are always interested in finding ways to stay up to date on changes in your industry, so consider attending a conference, seminar, or convention that might be going on in November.</p>
<p>Capricorns who will benefit the very most from this new moon on November 1 and in the weeks ahead are those who were born within five days of December 31 or those who have Capricorn rising or their natal moon in Capricorn between 5 and 15 degrees. If you have a natal planet in Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces, Taurus, Virgo, or Capricorn between 5 and 15 degrees in your birth chart, you will also benefit in a big way—look at the planet and see the house it occupies in your chart. After the new moon arrives, that planet will help you a great deal in whichever area it occupies.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at Venus, the planet in charge of your fifth house of true love. Good news! Venus will move into Capricorn on November 11 and stay until December 6, making your charm and charisma more noticeable and engaging. This is the perfect time to choose new pieces and accessories for your wardrobe and to investigate new ways to style your hair (men, too). Women might want to shop for new seasonal makeup colors, and both sexes might want to explore a new scent for the coming season during the time Venus will spend in Capricorn.</p>
<blockquote><p>All Capricorns have a chance to find love and fun this month, whether at social events or through surprising romantic encounters.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Only a few days after Venus enters Capricorn, the full moon on November 15 will appear in Taurus at 24 degrees. That full moon will brilliantly light your fifth house of true love for the first time this year. If you are single and hoping to meet your one truelove, this full moon is rich with possibilities.</p>
<p>The full moon on November 15 in Taurus (a compatible sign for you) will conjunct Uranus, the planet of surprise, so almost anything could happen. Uranus prides himself on his ability to bring unpredictable events, so I can’t say which way things will go. Uranus will simultaneously oppose the Sun in your friendship house, so you may have a problem with a friend, or a friend may be hit with some difficult news. If so, they’ll be appreciative of your emotional support.</p>
<p>Aside from what I just said, I CAN say that if you meet someone new romantically, the chemistry will be very strong and magnetic between you. When Uranus is involved, it is important to go slowly. You might not want to take things slow and easy, but you must if you want this relationship to last—that’s important to remember when you are dealing with Uranus.</p>
<p>If you have already found the person you love, you will enjoy this full moon, too. You will be more likely to find fun and romantic things to do together. You can take a long weekend out of town or have a late-night dinner in a restaurant you’ve always wanted to go to. If you love to cook, take out your fine china and surprise your partner with their favorite dish. Finding time to talk and focus on one another will be a delight during this full moon, so go ahead—linger over your meal. Giving your full attention to anyone is the greatest gift you could ever give that person.</p>

        <p>A full moon in the fifth house could also bring a special event to your calendar within the five days that it appears (November 15 to November 19, most likely on November 16). You might be attending a friend’s wedding, a lavish birthday party, or a baby shower, as some examples.</p>
<p>Speaking of babies, you might discover you are pregnant during this full moon, and that might be exciting news. (If you are not ready, be careful from the start of the month onward.) If you are pregnant and very near your due date, it might help to know that many babies are born at a full moon. Have your “go bag” at the ready just in case you suddenly need to head to the hospital.</p>
<p>There is another, different way this full moon on November 15 might affect you. If you have been working on a creative project in your personal life or for your work, that project should be coming to an end now—it will be ready to see the world.</p>
<p>All Capricorns have a chance to find love and fun at this full moon. Those who might get a double dip of pleasure include those born on January 14, plus or minus five days. The same is true if you have either Capricorn rising or your natal moon in Capricorn at 24 degrees, plus or minus five degrees.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to look at Pluto, a powerhouse planet that is in his last days of Capricorn in our lifetime. You have become used to having this power planet behind you, as Pluto first entered Capricorn in January 2008. He will leave permanently this month on November 19 after 16 years in Capricorn. You might miss his presence, for you had the chance to become quite a force of nature in your chosen profession or your community during that time. Now Pluto will head to your second house of earned income, which is a house that covers your savings and possessions. You now have a chance to save and invest wisely to create quite a bit of wealth.</p>

        <p>Pluto will not be back to Capricorn until February 2254, and no, that is not a typo. Pluto takes 248 years to revolve through all 12 zodiac signs, which is the reason the world will not see Pluto return to Capricorn anytime soon. Almost immediately after Pluto arrived in Capricorn in January 2008, the world saw a financial crisis of epic proportions, and Pluto moved to clean up some faulty structures in the banking industry’s practices. Now Pluto will be in Aquarius, ushering in the digital era and firmly presenting the long-awaited Age of Aquarius. Due to his slow orbit, Pluto is considered one of the most powerful of all planets, for he remains in each sign for a very long time, which can influence the theme of an entire generation. Inclusion, accessibility, and fairness to every person will become dominant themes.</p>
<p>The trend toward working in a more mobile way, with companies offering hybrid methods of working, will increase in some industries. (Not all industries can allow their employees to work from home during some days of the week, but those that can allow it, will.) Another change will be that conspicuous consumption will no longer hold the fascination that it once did for society—it won’t matter if you have the bigger house or the more expensive car than your neighbors or friends. What will matter is what you know and what you will share with others to make the world a better place—that will more strongly affect your status. Travel will become easier, faster, and possibly cheaper.</p>
<p>It never takes Pluto long to assert his presence in a new sign. During Pluto’s past tour of Capricorn, it was the king or president who set the agenda and told the populace what to do. In his writings, the Greek philosopher Plato called Capricorn “the philosopher king,” by which he meant that under Capricorn, the king or president took good care of the people in his care. With Aquarius, the picture is flipped: The people tell the king or president what they need, and in so doing, the people set the agenda. Every sign in the zodiac is in many ways the opposite of the sign that comes before it, and this is the way balance is kept in the horoscope.</p>

        <p>No discussion of Pluto’s move into Aquarius is complete without mentioning A.I., personal home robots, and driverless cars, already in the news. At this stage we are just scratching the surface—there will be so much more. The fun part is that we can’t even imagine what is to come because it has not yet been invented.</p>
<p>Will there be problems? Sure. Every massive change in society brings a need for a public forum, new laws, and guardrails. Just as the Industrial Revolution caused a flurry of problems—child labor, sweatshops, pollution, a need for seat belts in cars, and more—society found a way to tackle those problems to make life better and healthier. The same will be true for Pluto in Aquarius and our generation.</p>
<p>Before I go, I want to talk about the new moon on November 30 in Sagittarius, 10 degrees. That new moon will appear in your very private twelfth house and allow you time to rest after your very social month. The best conversation that new moon will have with another planet will be with Mars. Mars will have recently entered your house of other people’s money, so then would be a good time to meet with your financial advisor to make any necessary tweaks or changes to your investment portfolio.</p>
<p>The twelfth house is also associated with mental and physical health, so at the November 30 new moon would also be a good time to schedule your annual physical or seek out a therapist to talk over a problem, if you have been wrestling with one—you’ll see much progress if you begin after November 30.</p>

        <p>November is a big month for you, and at the same time we are moving into a period when several planets will be slowing down or moving into retrograde. Mercury will go retrograde in Sagittarius from November 25 to December 15 (and will be back to its former strength by January 2). Mercury rules communication, contracts, negotiation, shipping, and travel, so finish as many of your major tasks as you can in the first two weeks of November. That includes signing any important papers and shopping for holiday gifts. Seeing your financial advisor or doctor is fine to do when Mercury is retrograde, for you would be looking back to make sure any changes occurring in either area of your life are good ones, and if something needs to be put on track again, you can do so.</p>
<p>Mercury’s big brother Mars will also go retrograde (in Leo and mostly in Cancer) from December 6 to February 23, and Mars will work his way back to full power by April 30. Mars rules your home and family sector, so it would be best to wait until May to make decisions about that area of your life.</p>
<p>Venus will retrograde in Aries next year from March 1 to April 12, and will be back to former strength by May 15. Venus is the natural ruler of your career house (tenth house), so it will be a time of slow professional progress. Venus retrograde is not a time to look for a new romantic partner or to make any dramatic, expensive changes to your appearance. Avoid using Botox and fillers during Venus retrograde.</p>
<p>You have a festive month ahead, and there will be plenty of fun activities in November and December. You’ll be able to take a few days to catch your breath just after the new moon on November 30, but make sure to take care of yourself in the meantime.</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>At long last, love is coming into your life like a strong, powerful gust of air blasting through your window. If you get up to take a look at the view, you’ll see a plethora of stars strewn across the night sky like diamonds. You won’t have to wait long to see the proof of this lovely romantic trend that will be at play during the full moon November 15. Before that happens, you have an equally graceful and tender new moon to amp up your social life and put you in the right frame of mind to give and receive love.</p>
<p>The new moon on November 1 will bring you a noticeably more active social life, and friends will find clever ways to draw you off the couch and out of your house to be with them. It appears you may need to drive a short distance to attend some of the events they are planning for you. Not only will you have a superb chance to see and enjoy current friends, but you’ll also have the opportunity to make new friends, for a new moon is able to refresh whatever part of your life that it visits.</p>
<p>If you’ve been thinking about joining a club, whether social or professional in nature, send in your application sometime in the week that follows November 1. Your aim should be to expand your circle of friends—the results will be rewarding if you do.</p>
<p>From November 3 to January 6, Mars will be touring your eighth house of other people’s money, so you’ll be spending more than usual during this period. You might say everyone spends a lot at the end of the year buying gifts and attending parties, but you seem to be more focused on money than most people. You may be investing in your education or buying equipment if you have your own business, or you may be moving or buying a house—a major lifestyle change could be the reason for this higher-than-usual spending.</p>

        <p>Expenses will tone down by January, but keep an eye on your savings because spending could start up again from April 17 to June 17. Indeed, looking at this does suggest that a big lifestyle change seems to be bubbling up in your life.</p>
<p>By the full moon in compatible Taurus on November 15, a romantic relationship could come to full flower. Yet this full moon could bring all kinds of experiences from heartwarming to heartbreaking, and it all depends on how your relationship has been proceeding from the start—with or without your knowledge. Uranus will oppose the Sun, so if your partner has been spending a lot of money without your knowledge and dipping into your joint savings account without asking you (as one example), you would find out now.</p>
<p>This full moon will shine a light on any problem in a long-term or committed relationship. If there are no problems, you will sail through this period unaffected. If something does come up, money will be at the core of the conflict.</p>
<p>Still, this is a good full moon if you are single and hoping to meet someone new. You will likely meet suddenly and in an unusual way, at a moment when you are not expecting to meet anyone, certainly not a new romantic partner. Yet the chemistry is sure to be remarkably strong and magnetic between you.</p>
<p>Pluto will be beautifully supportive to both Uranus and the full moon in Taurus, which is very powerful help. The full moon and Uranus are both in your fifth sector of true love, associated with new romance. Pluto can produce quite passionate love, sometimes to a level of obsession, and with Pluto’s link to unpredictable Uranus, the possibility for an electric first meeting is heighted. Romance may be exciting now, but if you want your new relationship to last and not burn out, you may want to take it slow.</p>

        <p>Venus will do her part to help you by gliding along in Capricorn from November 11 to December 6. A romantic interest from your past may get back in touch with you. See how you feel. Venus in Capricorn makes this a great time to see about improving your appearance, especially on your best days, November 14 and November 15. New additions to your wardrobe and changes to your appearance will hit the spot and make you feel like a million dollars.</p>
<p>This full moon will be volatile, and emotions can be easily tipped in any direction without warning. If you know your partner well or are married, you have nothing to fear—have fun and celebrate each other. If you have recently met and are smitten, keep the relationship at a simmer for now—slow and steady wins the day.</p>
<p>Speaking of taking things slow, Mercury will be retrograde from November 25 until December 15. If you want to fully enjoy the holidays, shop for gifts early, in the first week or two of November, and ship packages by then, too. Weather delays and even strikes will slow down transportation, so to protect your holiday experience, shop and ship early.</p>
<p>The new moon at the end of the month on November 30 will usher in a time of reflection. You’re going to have a busy social life in November, and that will continue throughout the month. You may be looking forward to spending quality time with the family and friends who matter most to you in December. You have quite a forecast!</p>
