        <p>Before you dive into the joy of the coming holidays, you will decide to gain control of your finances. In fact, you might examine all parts of your income and outgo, a theme that will run throughout the first half of the month.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the new moon on November 1 in Scorpio at 10 degrees. A new moon is almost always good news because it nearly always opens opportunities in the house it appears. In this case, your second house of earned income will be lit up. This new moon will receive superb support from Saturn, which is currently based in your solar work-a-day assignment house (sixth house). Saturn can give you a feeling of financial security, offering you a solid foundation from which to build upon. Most people hope for a long relationship with their employer with plenty of room for growth or, if you are self-employed, a long relationship with a client. You can have this with Saturn’s help.</p>
<p>If you are not in the workforce but want to find a job, the new moon on November 1 could help you come across interesting opportunities that are similar to the position you had previously. (This new moon will communicate with Saturn in your sixth house, which indicates you likely won’t find a position with a better title, but you might be fine with that for now.) You will likely be able to find part-time work too, if that is your preference, which would help you earn extra holiday cash.</p>
<p>Pluto will take center stage at this new moon, and happily, Pluto will be in superb communication with Neptune, suggesting that any new job or assignment you accept will have room for you to flex your creativity and imagination. Pluto will also be in contact with Uranus, so you could receive a tidy sum of money you don’t expect, most likely from the work you take on. It looks like you would be paid well.</p>

        <p>The excellent work you’ve done for a certain client may have created buzz in your industry (especially if you publicized your success, something Libras know how to do quite well)—new business will seek you out. When on a job interview or pitch, don’t be shy about talking about your recent success on a particular project. It looks like you can find a new income stream without giving up a source you already have now, and this will come as a result of the new moon on November 1 in Scorpio.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to the full moon on November 15 in Taurus at 24 degrees, which will fall in your eighth house of other people’s money. You might hear back about an insurance claim you sent in or an application for a mortgage or bank loan. If you are self-employed, you could be sending estimated tax or conversely, receiving a tax refund. If you work in sales, you might earn a large commission, or if you wrote a book, you could receive a generous royalty check. If you pitched a venture capitalist, you would hear back about whether or not you will be granted the funds. This full moon will form a trine with Pluto, which suggests a generous sum for you.</p>
<p>If you are going through a divorce, you may now arrive at a settlement and receive your portion of the proceeds accrued during the marriage. (If you are opening talks about money owed to you or awaiting a court settlement on any topic, it will be decided and approved by you quickly.) If you applied for university financial aid or even a scholarship, you would hear back now. On a simpler level, you may be paying all your monthly bills to clear them off your desk.</p>
<blockquote><p>You will know where you stand financially and be able to plan accordingly. Remember, you are a lucky magnet for money, dear Libra, so stay optimistic.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Aim to complete all the important items on your to-do list in the first half of the month. Consider finishing your holiday shopping in the first half of November, too. We are heading into a very slow period because Mercury will retrograde in Sagittarius from November 25 to December 15.</p>
<p>This retrograde will complicate shopping and shipping because they are both ruled by Mercury. Black Friday and Cyber Monday will occur within this Mercury retrograde period—not a good time to buy electronics. Mercury will be retrograde in your solar third house, which covers shipping, transportation, and commerce. Alas, a bargain is not a bargain if your recipient doesn’t like the brand or model you chose for them—you may be better off giving them a gift card. You will need to send it early because weather delays might be rampant.</p>
<p>When any planet retrogrades, it does not immediately snap to full power on the day it goes direct. It is a little groggy, just like some people, so Mercury will need a little coffee and time to get oriented. He will be back to full power on January 2, 2025.</p>
<p>To complicate things further, Mercury’s big brother Mars will go retrograde in Leo on December 6 and will backtrack into Cancer before moving direct on February 23, 2025. Mars will retrograde in your career sector during those nearly three months, but since he rules your seventh house of partnerships and collaborations, it may take clients time to make up their minds about projects or about joining you during the Mars retrograde. On the upside, former business associates could come back to work with you.</p>

        <p>You will be finished with your meditations about money by the full moon on November 15, plus five days, taking you up to November 20.</p>
<p>From then on you will look into taking some quick, short trips after the new moon in Sagittarius, 10 degrees, which will appear on November 30. That new moon will affect you for many weeks ahead, although it will be strongest in the 10 days following its appearance. Action Mars will be perfectly angled to that new moon from his perch in your friendship sector, so Mars will motivate you to step out. You may be invited to a holiday party at a friend’s house out of town or to stay at a pal’s home for one night or more. That new moon will appear in your sibling sector (third house), so you might be traveling to see your sister.</p>
<p>The November 30 new moon will be in hard angle to Saturn in your project sector (sixth house), so you may have to work diligently to make sure certain details are taken care of and set before you head out. Since time will be precious, even if your event is only an hour or two away, you won’t want to leave anything hanging and unfinished before you go. It may be that your team members will have to contribute to the assignment after your part is done. You will be mindful about not holding them up. You can finish everything up in time, so I hope you decide to go.</p>
<p>When Mercury is retrograde, it is always a good idea to bring your car into the garage for a tune-up by your mechanic to be sure it is in good working order, especially suited for all kinds of weather in your vicinity.</p>
<p>The new moon of November 30 will help all Libras because this Sagittarius new moon will blend beautifully with your Sun sign, especially if your birthday falls on October 2, plus or minus five days. The same is true if you have Libra rising or your natal moon is in Libra at 10 degrees, plus or minus five degrees.</p>

        <p>You can do your chart if you go to the homepage of my website (Astrologyzone.com), and you will receive it for free. If you have not done your chart yet, you might want to open your laptop, access your chart, and then print it out to keep, complete with my written interpretations. (You probably won’t be able to print from your smartphone, which is the reason I say it would be best to use your computer.) Once you have your chart, take a look at your planets to see if you have a natal planet in Aries, Leo, Sagittarius, Gemini, Libra, or Aquarius within 5 degrees of 10 degrees. If you do, this planet will work extra hard for you.</p>
<p>After the new moon on November 30, see if you can go away any time within the first 10 days of December. Your ruler Venus will be flirting with Uranus, the planet that governs your truelove sector (fifth house), so you could have quite an outstanding romantic experience, more than you might expect.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>At the start of the month you will be on the lookout to find ways to make more money. The new moon of November 1 will get the ball rolling. This is a friendly new moon, so if you’ve not had a raise in a long time and feel you deserve one, speak up in the days that quickly follow November 1. This new moon is giving you an ideal time to bring in extra funds.</p>
<p>If the company you work for has a wage freeze going on, look for other options—namely, to find a job somewhere else. Mars, the action planet, will boost your motivation to discover new opportunities, and he will give you the element of luck, too. Explore foreign people and overseas markets as possible sources of good fortune. If you’re involved in the import-export of ideas, goods, or services or work regularly with people abroad, you are on the right track because this could be a lucrative area for you. There are other areas of gain, such as publishing and broadcasting companies as well as colleges and the collegiate market. Legal moves could help you too, such as if you file a trademark or patent in early November.</p>

        <p>Consider doing a side job on weekends, for strong, supportive vibrations from Saturn suggest that you could find interesting work on a temporary basis along with decent money. Another way to bring in extra cash might be to sell clothes and accessories that you no longer need on consignment websites. Alternatively, you might donate these items to a charity for a possible tax deduction. You could offer your home or other property you own or rent to a location scout to use for the production of a movie or TV show.</p>
<p>If you plan to travel, especially mid-month, your spending might increase when you are distracted, but you will be in a “let’s save money” mode. In that case, keep an eye on your expenses by checking your credit card’s app. This way you will avoid “sticker shock” when the bill comes so you won’t discover you owe quite a bit more than you’d ever thought possible.</p>
<p>If anything untoward happens regarding money, don’t give up. For example, if you applied for university financial aid and are turned down, or discover the amount of financial aid that was approved for you is less than last year’s allotment, write an appeal. Your aspects are strong enough that you could find a way to secure the money you need.</p>
<p>More talks will come up at the full moon on November 15, and they could bring closure to a financial matter that has been pending. This full moon will fall in your house of other people’s money, your eighth house, so you may be “shopping” for the best deal you can make for a loan with a bank. For example, if you hope to buy a condo, you might be applying for a mortgage, or if you want to start your own business, you may be pitching venture capitalists. On a smaller scale, if you put in for a raise earlier in the month, you could receive your answer within five days after November 15.</p>

        <p>If one of your parents needs special care, you might summon other family members to help share the cost of your loved one’s care. Pluto is currently in your home sector and will be in perfect angle to both this full moon and Uranus, indicating that you may be surprised at how quickly you’re able to pull together all the money you need to take excellent care of your mom or dad.</p>
<p>Saturn will turn direct on November 15 too, having been retrograde since June 29 of this year. This will brighten your job prospects and help your assignments go more smoothly.</p>
<p>The November 15 full moon in your financial house will be connected to Uranus, a planet that causes volatility, which means friendship and money won’t mix. If a situation grows tense, you could lose a friendship over a financial disagreement, so choose your words with grace. On the other hand, Uranus can work in a more upbeat way—you could receive an influx of cash you never expected, possibly by winning a contest or charity raffle.</p>
<p>No matter what financial matter is concluding at the November 15 full moon, this full moon will put to rest all monetary talks, decisions, and actions within five days of its appearance. You will know where you stand and be able to plan accordingly. Remember, you are a lucky magnet for money, dear Libra, so stay optimistic.</p>

        <p>In late November, you may decide to travel after the new moon arrives in Sagittarius on November 30, possibly to visit your sibling, cousin, or close friends. You will finally be free of your financial talks, so you will no doubt feel footloose and fancy free to enjoy yourself. You might want to plan your travels for the first weekend of December for best results.</p>
<p>If you plan to take a longer period of time off (not just a weekend), make sure you have blessings from your boss, client, and the rest of your team to leave town. There is some indication that you might miss out on a lucrative job or opportunity to make money while you are gone. If you decide to go, with Saturn in hard angle to that new moon, it appears you will have to prepare for your time off by working diligently and late into the night to have all of your assignments done and ready to hand over to your team members before you head out.</p>
<p>Uranus, the planet of surprise, will be beautifully angled to Venus, your ruler, so you’ll be feeling spontaneous and willing to do anything it takes to pack and go. If you travel with your sweetheart or spouse, your trip has every indication of being quite romantic.</p>
