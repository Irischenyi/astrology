        <p>Last month you had a great deal of evidence that your source of income may be in the process of changing, due to the presence of the new moon solar eclipse on October 2. At the same time, you may have heard more good news about how well you are doing in your career. At work, you stay focused on the job at hand, which is the reason you are so lauded. Your ability to handle details is unsurpassed by the rest of the zodiac.</p>
<p>All that concentration can be exhausting, and although you are doing great in your career, it’s time for a change of scene. Travel is written all over your chart in the first half of November, so if you want to go on a trip, you will find a way. The new moon on Friday, November 1, in Scorpio at 10 degrees will make your travel dream possible. It will likely be to a location within 200 miles, but no matter—getting out of town will feel good. You seem to be going for personal reasons—perhaps to see a sweetheart or enjoy the changing colors of nature—but I cannot be sure about that. If you go for business, it will likely be to pitch a creative idea to a client.</p>
<p>The new moon of November 1 will put Pluto, which is in Capricorn, in charge, but Pluto will be in direct opposition to Mars, positioned across the sky in the last degree of Cancer. This can be a difficult aspect, so if you do travel to see a sweetheart, avoid making controversial statements, and aim for harmony. Pluto opposite Mars can be explosive. If you travel to see a client, be sure you have done all your homework and have all the facts, as well as the history of the client, before you try to negotiate.</p>
<p>The problem is the client is apt to make demands you are not ready to meet. If you find yourself in a difficult, deadlocked situation, ask for more time to consider your client’s demands, and assure your client you will run his or her request by the office. Breaking the chain of discussion may help, for that’s when creative ideas tend to surface.</p>

        <p>Still, Saturn will be in superb angle to this new moon and will help you cement a relationship in business or romance. The difficult aspect between Mars and Pluto will occur and then move on, but Saturn’s effects will last longer.</p>
<p>Lots of communication will come up immediately in the first week of November, and it will be a busy time whether you travel or not. This new moon has extraordinary help and support from Saturn, the planet of stability and security.</p>
<p>A new moon is not like a full moon, which acts fairly quickly and is gone. In contrast, a new moon will continue to deliver its news for five months (a full moon will deliver its message instantly, within five days—not months), although I will admit that the new moon’s influence is strongest in the week after it appears. Over the course of five months, its influence will gradually decline.</p>
<p>It looks as though you will be able to travel much more than you have lately, but only if you want to. At home base, it is very likely that you will be presented with papers to sign, such as a contract, lease, or other agreement.</p>
<p>If you are ready to sign, do so early in early November, for Mercury is about to retrograde from November 25 to December 15. Mercury is your ruling planet, so you will likely feel Mercury retrograde more strongly than most others around you.</p>
<blockquote><p>All your travel this month will likely be done for fun, love, and relaxation, so follow any instincts to take some time away.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Additionally, Mercury’s big brother Mars will also retrograde soon, but for a much longer period, from December 6 to February 23. You may need to hurry paperwork along to sign in early November because signing when Mercury and Mars are retrograde is not favorable. In business, Mars teaches us how to compete, but with Mars out of phase in December and through most of February, it will be hard to sell anything to anyone. Business will be slow, and the reason is not because of the outcome of the US (or any other nation’s) election. Business will be slower no matter which political candidate gets in power. This event affects the world, not only one country.</p>
<p>This all means that you should do your best to begin your holiday shopping early in November so that you don’t face weather and shipping delays or low inventory and empty shelves. The third house (sign of the new moon in your chart) also rules siblings, so you might want to huddle with your sister or brother about presents you want to buy various family members. If you want to buy property with your sibling or start a business together, you have the ideal new moon to do that.</p>
<p>Virgos who will do best at this new moon will be those who have a birthday that falls within five days of September 2 (before or after). The same is true if you have Virgo rising or your natal moon in Virgo, 10 degrees (plus or minus five degrees). It would be a good idea if you want to look up your natal chart, for you will get more out of my forecasts that way. Go to the home page of my website (astrologyzone.com) and click on “Free Natal Birth Chart.” It is free and complete with my interpretation, and you can print it out from your computer.</p>
<p>Once you have your chart, look to see if you have any planets in Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces, Taurus, Virgo, or Capricorn at 10 degrees (plus or minus five degrees). If you have one, that planet will be very helpful to you at this time.</p>

        <p>The full moon of November 15 in Taurus, 24 degrees, will also light a part of your chart ruling travel. This part of your chart, the ninth house, encourages more distant travel. It is meant to be a broadening influence, one that helps you learn about the world and come into contact with many different kinds of people, including those from other nations and cultures. I love this full moon because it includes the element of surprise, thanks to its proximity to Uranus. Watch the week of November 13 to November 20 to see unexpected things happen.</p>
<p>You might travel during this time, or you may get an answer back from a university application you sent to the admissions office. If you are in college or graduate school, you may take an important test. If you work in publishing or broadcasting, you may be finishing up writing your book or an important TV segment feature. Virgos make great editors, so you may have been working on a key project with an author. Alternatively, you may be working on something digital, such as an app, game, or another project that deals with A.I.</p>
<p>All Virgos should enjoy this highly compatible full moon in Taurus on November 15. If you were born on September 16 (plus five days or minus two days) or have your natal moon in Virgo within five degrees of 24 degrees, you will get a double dip of pleasure. If you have a natal planet in Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn, Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces at 24 degrees (plus or minus five degrees), you will also benefit, for that planet will light up brilliantly and work hard to help you. If you do have such a planetary placement, this full moon will bring plenty of news.</p>
<p>Working on digital projects is very possible from now on, for Pluto will move into Aquarius on November 19 and stay for a very long time. Pluto first entered Aquarius earlier this year from January 20 to September 1 to give us a little preview of what is to come, but now Pluto is back and set to stay until January 19, 2044, a period of close to 20 years! Pluto is the slowest moving planet in our solar system and has not been in Aquarius since the time of the American and French revolutions.</p>

        <p>This tour of Pluto will announce the movement of the world into the Age of Aquarius. You may realize that you are starting to work with more and more digital projects, so you might want to take a course in A.I. to find out how you can harness some of its power right away. This full moon of November 15 will be in lovely angle to Pluto, so you might want to investigate digital forms immediately (or get an assignment in that area if you are already well versed in new A.I. software).</p>
<p>There are two things to watch out for—the opposition of Mars to Pluto, and Uranus opposed to the Sun, which is still somewhat within orb at the time of the full moon on November 15. This suggests that you need to be good to your health and take tender loving care of yourself. You tend to work so hard that you forget to eat and get enough sleep. Also, at this full moon, if anyone accuses you of doing something that you didn’t do, you will need to stand up for yourself. I am not sure this will affect you, but I just thought I should flag it in the small chance that it does.</p>
<p>Overall, I love this full moon. It is filled with magic and mystery, elegance and sparkle. Neptune, the planet of the arts and also unconditional love, will beautifully support this full moon, and you will also get firm support from Pluto.</p>
<p>As you get to month’s end, your travels will be over, and you will begin to direct your attention to home and family to get ready for the coming holidays. On November 30 Mars will be in the perfect place—Cancer—to stimulate the Sun and new moon in Sagittarius in your fourth house of home, giving you the motivation to do some maintenance to polish up your domestic environment. Saturn will square the Sun and new moon, indicating you may take on too much at home—ask for help to be sure that you will enjoy the coming time with family and friends.</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Virgo is known to be talented in the communication arts. This month, due to the new moon on November 1 in compatible Scorpio and your third house of communication, you may prove just how skilled you are in this arena. You might be working on a writing, speaking, editing, or translation assignment, or you may be developing a website, phone app, digital game, or new software. Or you may be getting ready to launch a series of podcasts. It’s also possible you are working on an advertising or publicity campaign for yourself or a client. Indeed, you might even be offered your own TV show.</p>
<p>Your solar third house, so brilliantly lit for you, rules negotiation and contractual matters, too. This suggests you may be working on hammering out a deal that you and a client will soon sign. If you work in sales, you are likely to be busy. There are many possibilities. You will enjoy your project because it can help you showcase your talents.</p>
<p>You might be working in tandem with a partner, such as another writer or an art director, in the first part of November. Alternatively, you may be working closely with your editor or producer, or if you are a lawyer, collaborating with another lawyer in your firm to prepare a contract. If so, Saturn will help you solidify the relationship so that your interaction will be smooth, productive, and long-lasting. (There is a good chance that you will opt to work together on future projects.)</p>
<p>Travel also forms part of your busy third house, so you may be tempted to leave town to take a breather on weekends, perhaps over November 2-3 or November 9-10. Either weekend would be ideal for a pleasure trip. All your travel, as reflected in your solar chart, will likely be done for fun, love, and relaxation. If you do go for work, you will likely discuss a creative idea with a client.</p>

        <p>The full moon, arriving on November 15, could bring possibilities for travel too, for this full moon will fall in highly compatible Taurus and light your ninth house of distant travel. Although the ninth house is most associated with international relationships and overseas travel, it also covers distant domestic travel, as well as publishing, broadcasting, your pursuits for higher education, and legal matters—one of these areas is likely to light up for you. Full moons bring closure and completion, so you may be happy with how things go.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that your ruler Mercury, the planet that governs communication and transportation, is due to go retrograde from November 25 until December 15. You will start to feel the impending slowdown that Mercury is known to bring well before its official shutdown—I feel you will sense a slower pace as soon as November 17. This behooves you to make all your most important initiations in the first half of the month.</p>
<p>Even more concerning, Mercury’s big brother Mars, the energy planet now in Leo, will also retrograde from December 6 to February 23, a nearly three-month period that will slow the pace of life even more than Mercury could ever do. It is never wise to launch a project while Mars is retrograde. Astrology teaches that the date you choose to start any new venture is its “birth,” and it should be chosen carefully for the aspects on that date will affect its progress and even suggest its outcome.</p>
<p>On a smaller scale, do all your holiday shopping before November 14 (keeping a large space of days before Mercury officially turns retrograde on November 25), as it is never wise to buy electronics or expensive items while Mercury is out of phase. Mercury makes us rush, and we can become forgetful or not think straight. You might resort to buying gift cards as presents for friends and family, and that would be a fine option, considering the astrological environment.</p>
<p>As you get closer to the end of the month, a bright new moon in Sagittarius on November 30 will switch your attention to home, other property you may own or rent (or want to buy or sell), and the loving care of family members. Saturn will be in hard angle to that new moon, so apparently you’ll have important duties to fill then. At the same time, you’ll be motivated to make your home cozy and inviting for the coming holidays. If anyone knows how to do this, it’s you, dear Virgo.</p>
