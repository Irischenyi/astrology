        <p>This month starts out slowly and quietly, and for that you will be grateful. You’ve had a lot of activity in your life, so the new moon in Scorpio that occurs on November 1 will bring you a chance to catch your breath and think about all you would like to accomplish in your coming birthday year. A new moon is not influential for just a day but for months, and this new moon is outstandingly special. I will say, however, that a new moon is especially powerful at the time when it appears and for the 10 days that follow.</p>
<p>This new moon lights your twelfth house, a house of healing, rest, and at times, confinement. In the case of confinement, this sector rules hospitals, nursing homes, rehab centers, physical therapy clinics, and other areas of care. If you need a surgery, you might want to schedule the operation for a date during the first two weeks of November. This will be a good, strong month, but we are heading into a slew of retrogrades from the smaller “personal” planets. These are the ones that orbit closest to earth and that we feel strongest when they retrograde—Mercury, Mars, and Venus.</p>
<p>First the little “Dennis the Menace” planet Mercury will go retrograde from November 25 to December 15, throwing a monkey wrench into your holiday shopping and shipping. (Mercury rules commerce, transportation, and shipping.) It is never wise to sign a contract or buy any items with electronic chips or mechanical gears inside during Mercury retrograde. This would probably not be a good time for elective surgery either, unless it is urgent, and for that you should do it immediately—your doctor can make that call. However, the Sun in Sagittarius will warm the healing center of your chart, so this would be an excellent time to not only see a medical doctor but also a trained therapist if you need to talk over a problem or become free of a substance that is hurting your health.</p>
<p>Saturn will be in ideal communication with the November 1 new moon, so the progress you make will remain with you—Saturn gives slow but sure, step-by-step progress that lasts. Since Saturn is traveling through your family sector, if you have been troubled by a relationship with a family member, Saturn is urging you to seek psychological help. Afterward, you would feel so much freer and lighter.</p>

        <p>Saturn is also about to help you in a bigger way—he will both boost the effectiveness of the new moon on November 1 and go direct on November 15 (coincidently, this is the same day as this month’s full moon). Saturn has been retrograding since June 29. Saturn will see that your property -and family-related matters show excellent progress starting after November 15.</p>
<p>On another topic, you may have been going through an expensive period, but as soon as Mars leaves for Leo on November 3, to stay until January 6, 2025, you will see your spending drop. Mars in Leo is a fine place for him to be because the Red Planet will light up your ninth house of distant travel—your very favorite activity. Leo is a fire sign like your Sagittarius Sun sign, so Mars will blend beautifully with your Sun and make travel much more possible in the weeks ahead. However, I would avoid taking any trips over the full moon period from November 15 to November 19 because costs could mount up unexpectedly with no way to avoid them.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that we are due to run into a number of retrograde planets, so let’s go back and pick up that thread of the conversation and continue. You already know Mercury is about to retrograde later this month from November 25 to December 15. No planet jumps back to its former strength the minute it goes direct, and in the case of Mercury, he will return to full alertness by January 2, 2025.</p>
<blockquote><p>No dream is too big, dear Sagittarius, to start working on. You have the talent, and opportunity is coming. Success is within your grasp.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Mercury’s big brother Mars will also go retrograde and overlap part of his little brother’s retrograde. Mars will retrograde from December 6, 2024, to February 23, 2025—a very long time. Mars won’t be back to full strength until April 30, 2025, making for a slow start to the year. Mars’ role in the planetary lineup is to compete well and courageously, mainly by striving to be the best. With Mars out of phase, it will be harder to muster the motivation to pull out all the stops and perform at your highest level. For those who are determined, it is possible to do so, but it will take a lot more energy than usual. Mars retrograde is not a great time to date someone entirely new, but if you have been dating someone for a long while, it’s fine.</p>
<p>Just when Mars returns to full strength, it will be Venus’ turn to go retrograde from March 1, 2025, to April 12, 2025. Venus rules love, affection, luxury, beauty, and all the steps you take to become more attractive. Venus won’t be back to her former strength until May 16, 2025. Hold off on making a dramatic change to your appearance or the way you wear your hair, and avoid expensive treatments during this period.</p>
<p>As you see, it would be best to act on important activities in November—before you get all tangled up in these planets’ retrogrades. I will help you through the coming months, for each planet rules a different part of life, so you will know which tasks you can easily accomplish and which ones you should be careful to avoid. Retrograde planets let us reflect and review past decisions and actions to help us see what worked well and what did not—and why.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to look at the full moon on November 15 in Taurus, 24 degrees. This full moon will light your sixth house, which rules your health and work. If you have gone for tests and screenings, you would likely receive the results within five days of this full moon, between November 15 and November 19.</p>

        <p>Pluto, the planet of regeneration and transformation, will be in ideal contact with this full moon and the Sun. If you are told the tests show something that you need to fix, the planet you would want on your side to recover is Pluto—and that is the heavenly body you have actively helping you. (Note: I am not saying that if you have any medical screenings done they will reveal anything, but IF the tests do alert you to something that you have to address, you have Pluto, a powerhouse planet, on your side.)</p>
<p>Your sixth house also rules work-a-day projects, and it seems you will be wrapping up a major personal or professional project at the November 15 full moon. Uranus will be conjunct this full moon, and Uranus brings unusual, strange, or completely unexpected situations—in other words, it will make this full moon volatile. Still, Pluto will come to the rescue, bringing you a “trine” (a heavenly, harmonious aspect), so the unusual situation that is reaching fullness may be one that you will welcome. I would refrain from traveling at this time, however—with Uranus opposed to the Sun during this full moon, you may run into many frustrating delays and difficulties, plus additional expenses.</p>
<p>If you are finishing a work project at this full moon and preparing to ship it to your client, Pluto’s position in your financial sector strongly suggests that this assignment could pay you exceptionally well.</p>
<p>Your biggest moment this month will occur at the new moon in Sagittarius, 10 degrees, on November 30. A new moon in your own sign is very important. It is a little like receiving a bundle of energy from the universe, and you can use it any way you like. Mars in your travel sector will be in perfect support of that new moon, which might allow you to take a distant trip to celebrate your birthday on foreign shores.</p>

        <p>The November 30 new moon will also form a “square” with Saturn, which is the planet of duty and responsibility, so the only reason you would not be able to pack and go would be if you have small children, a parent, or other family member who depends on you for their care and sustenance or if your boss would request you not to step away from an assignment. This is the first time in 29 years that you are hosting Saturn in Pisces and your domestic sector—you only have two or three visits from Saturn to any one part of your chart in your lifetime, and it sometimes represents an area in which you are given a cosmic test or challenge that reveals your deepest values.</p>
<p>Only you can decide how you will use that new moon. If you have a loving, trustworthy relative who can step in to help you care for your child or other relative for a few days, you can go. If you can’t head out, there will still be benefits to you remaining at home. Saturn’s job is to present opportunities to build character and maturity, and the house that Saturn occupies represents the areas of your greatest potential personal growth, and for you that’s currently home and family. Saturn has been in this part of your chart since March 2023 and will remain there until February 2026, so you are halfway through this transit. There is joy in giving comfort and a sense of security to others.</p>
<p>The November 30 new moon in Sagittarius puts Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, in charge. Since last May, you have hosted the good-fortune planet in your seventh house of marriage. This is the first time in 12 years that Jupiter has visited your house of serious commitment, partnership, and marriage. For the first time in a long time, you may be entertaining the idea of getting married. As a Sagittarius, you are very discerning, and you take your time to make decisions.</p>
<p>If you have found the right person for you, there won’t be any question any more—you will announce your engagement on your birthday or next month during Christmas or another religious holiday, or you both might want to exchange rings and promises on New Year’s Eve against a sky filled with beautiful, vivid fireworks. If you need a new place to live, look for a space immediately—Saturn in your home sector won’t stop you from finding your dream house, but it will require more time than usual. Get started early and you will enjoy the results of your efforts.</p>

        <p>Now before I go, let’s discuss the historic news of Pluto’s move on November 19 to Aquarius and your third house of communication and negotiation. Pluto has not been in Aquarius since the time of the American Revolution and the French Revolution, so this is big news—it takes Pluto 248 years to circle the Sun. Pluto did make an appearance in your third house recently, from January 20 to September 1 this year, and then retrograded back to Capricorn to tie up loose ends. When Pluto returns to Aquarius this month, he will stay there until January 19, 2044, nearly 20 years from now. This move will put you squarely in tune with the digital Age of Aquarius and will change the look and feel of the age we all live in forever.</p>
<p>Pluto will teach you how to communicate smoothly, clearly, and effectively. No matter what your profession happens to be, you will be affected by A.I., and you will learn to harness its power to work more efficiently. We already know about driverless cars and flying taxis, but there is so much more to come. Buckle up because the ride will be exciting, and you will be so happy to be alive as society walks over the rickety bridge from one way of life to another.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You’ve had an active year, and as you start November, you will need to slow down and rest while you plot your course for the coming months. The new moon of November 1 will appear in Scorpio and your twelfth house, a place where deep thinking, creativity, and strategic planning take place. Saturn is in your home sector and will be beautifully in tune with this new moon, indicating that if there are any changes you want to make to your home or other property, you can begin. Saturn will require patience and time, but if you start early, you have the luxury of choosing your very best option.</p>
<p>Since Saturn entered Pisces and your domestic sector in March 2023, it has been hard for you to make home-related adjustments, because Saturn has put obstacles in your path. This new moon will open a doorway for you, so if change is important to you, you can move forward. The same is true if you have hoped to help a family member in a substantial way—financially, intellectually, or emotionally. Saturn will be “trine” the Sun and the November 1 new moon, which is the most harmonious aspect possible. If you look for possible answers, it appears you can find ones that you like and would be suitable to the situation.</p>

        <p>Mars, the action planet, will be in Leo from November 3, 2024, to January 6, 2025, and Leo is a fellow fire sign that blends beautifully with your Sun sign. This will allow you to travel again, which is Sagittarius’ favorite activity. This month clever little Mercury will go retrograde from November 25 to December 15, so you will have to be extra careful about tagging your luggage and making sure you have everything you need to take with you. Little things, like leaving your power cord for your laptop at home, can cause stress at your destination, so make a list of everything you’ll need.</p>
<p>If you have obligations at home—to care for a little baby or one of your parents—you may choose to stay home. If you do, you will be fulfilling part of Saturn’s aim—to build your character and show you that caring tenderly for others can be more satisfying than doing something for ourselves.</p>
<p>By mid-November Mars will start to subtly slow down in anticipation of going retrograde next month from December 6, 2024, to February 23, 2025. Even before Mars goes retrograde, his little brother Mercury will go retrograde from November 25 to December 15. You will notice that your plans will take longer to actualize, and you might occasionally feel like you are doing something over and over again. On the plus side, retrograde periods will open your schedule as events will be canceled. You will have time to review your past actions and decide on which areas worked well for you (and why) and what should be tweaked in the light of everything you’ve learned.</p>
<p>You would be wise to shop for holiday gifts in the first two weeks of November rather than wait for sales—inventory will run low, and shipping will encounter delays. To avoid holiday exasperations, jump on your shopping early in the month, well in advance of Mercury and Mars retrograde. This way, you won’t encounter most of the frustrations inherent when these planets start to fall asleep.</p>

        <p>The full moon on November 15 will fall in Taurus and bring a work project to a conclusion. You will be rushing to finish it and send it out the door before VIPs leave for the coming holidays. You seem to be using a lot of energy, so be sure to take good care of your health. A full moon in your sixth house, as you will have, might bring a cold or flu if you are not careful. If you are self-employed, you could be paid quite well for your efforts—Pluto in your earned income sector (second house) will be in fine conversation with this full moon in your sixth house.</p>
<p>As you move to finish the details of this project, you will experience something unusual about this assignment as Uranus, the planet of unexpected developments, will be conjunct this full moon. There is no way to prepare for this—it is Uranus’ nature to create circumstances that you’d never think would be in the realm of possibility, so keep your “antennae” up. Since a sudden, last-minute request from the client or your boss is possible, stay flexible. It looks like the outcome could be happy and welcome, bringing a surprise, such as glowing praise from your higher-ups.</p>
<p>The full moon on November 15 will also be a good occasion to attend any medical tests or screenings. At this time, you are likely to get the results back. If you have to address a wellness matter, having Pluto in perfect angle to this full moon and the Sun will be a blessing, so if you follow your doctor’s orders, you will soon be on the road to better health. They call Pluto the planet of transformation for a reason!</p>

        <p>The new moon on November 30 in Sagittarius will be a big moment in your timeline because it will help you grasp a wish that’s dear to your heart. Usually, I tell you how to best use the energy of a new moon, depending on the house and sign it falls in, but that new moon will be different. It will appear in your own sign of Sagittarius and your first house of your personality and identity, so you can direct its energy in any way you wish. It will be like having a cosmic gift certificate.</p>
<p>Finally, Pluto will make a historic move into Aquarius for the first time since January 1778. Once Pluto arrives there on November 19, this powerhouse planet will remain in Aquarius for nearly 20 years, until January 19, 2044.</p>
<p>When Pluto moves into your third house, he will bring you more opportunities to travel to nearby locations and to have a closer relationship with your sister, brother, or cousin. The third house is known as the house of communication, and most Sagittarians are excellent writers and storytellers—the coming year could finally be the time you write the novel you have inside you and enjoy great popular acclaim as a result. No dream is too big, dear Sagittarius, to start working on. You have the talent, and opportunity is coming. You’ll find yourself at the crossroads, and within the coming 20 years, success will be within your grasp.</p>
