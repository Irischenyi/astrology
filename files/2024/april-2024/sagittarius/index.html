        <p>A total eclipse of the Sun in Aries is due to arrive on April 8, and you have probably already heard about it in the news because there is a big stir about this one. This total eclipse of the Sun will be clearly visible in the United States, which is rare—most eclipses are seen elsewhere.</p>
<p>This eclipse will appear in Aries, 19 degrees, in your fifth house of true love, specifically pointing to a person you are dating but not married to. This house often sparks love and covers romance and fun in its early stages before a serious commitment is made. Once you wed, your relationship moves to the seventh house, where solemn promises are made and a contract is signed. (In truth, the seventh house is basically a contractual house of important relationships overall and includes not only marriage but serious business alliances too, which are also made with a contract.)</p>
<p>If you are single, you may meet someone new—someone who deeply captures your imagination and who you will want to know better. This is a friendly eclipse, and as a new moon, it will open new doors for you. If you are dating seriously, you may gradually come to a decision about whether to continue the relationship as it is, go to the next step, or leave without regret. Eclipses push you forward and change timetables, so things you were going to do months or even two years down the road could easily happen now. They often bring big life events we long remember.</p>
<p>You will have a lot of energy in your fifth house of romance: the new moon solar eclipse, the Sun, Venus, and Mercury—four heavenly bodies in all. Mars, ruler of Aries and currently in your home and family sector, will take the lead at this eclipsed new moon. You may be deciding whether to move in with someone, or you could be discussing how to calm the waters if people in your family are not enthusiastic about your romantic relationship.</p>

        <p>The fifth house covers much more than romance, love, fun, and vacations. Before I tell you about the other areas that the fifth house covers—and might draw your attention during the eclipse—I need to tell you something else.</p>
<p>Mercury is in retrograde this month from April 1 to April 25, and this retrograde is in Aries, the same sector as the eclipse.</p>
<p>Mercury is the planet of intelligent data, facts, and figures, and the world generally depends on a healthy, alert Mercury to guide us along in our daily lives. When it is in sleepy retrograde mode, getting hard facts is difficult. Communication becomes garbled and open to interpretation (and is often taken the wrong way). People also tend to rush to decisions that are based on innuendo, gossip, and assumptions—adding up to misinformation—and make bad choices. This is especially challenging for your career progress because Mercury RULES your professional growth and reputation—so you will have to be resigned to a slow pace—but is travelling IN your house of true love (fifth house).</p>
<p>It is easy to see why it is not a good time to sign a contract, and it is also not the time to hire people or to buy expensive items. Do so in your glorious month of May. Be careful to avoid buying expensive electronic items, including cars, which these days are loaded with electronic chips. You will be far happier with your purchase if you wait until May to shop.</p>
<blockquote><p>Put a circle around Saturday April 20. A new assignment could spontaneously come up, and it should be one that pays well, too.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Now let’s get back to the eclipse. The fifth house rules your children, and being a new moon, you may start to plan a future course for your child. If your child is small, you may find a preschool for him, or if much older, you may be visiting colleges with your daughter. If you have been concerned about the well-being of one of your children who needs a serious solution to an ongoing problem, such as a birth defect or other medical or psychological problem, the eclipse will likely help you find options and, in time, the answer.</p>
<p>The fifth house also rules pregnancy, so with four heavenly bodies in the fifth house, you might discover you or your partner is pregnant. You may be very surprised. If you want a baby, this may be good news, but if you are not ready for a child, or do not want any children, you need to be careful.</p>
<p>The fifth house, which rules love and children, also rules your imagination and creativity, so this same new moon eclipse on April 8 can open up a new path for artistic expression. You may get an exciting new project that you will love and can’t wait to start.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the aspects of this solar eclipse of April 8. The new moon and the Sun have no aspects to other planets (which is unusual). However, Pluto, positioned in your third house of communication and short travel, will send a direct beam to Venus in your love sector. This aspect can create very warm and passionate love. Venus rules your eleventh house of joy, hopes, wishes, and friendship. You may be invited to a beautiful and luxurious event.</p>
<p>The Sagittarians who will be most affected by the eclipse will be those with a birthday that falls on December 11, plus or minus five days. If you have Sagittarius rising at 19 degrees, plus or minus five degrees, you also will be affected, and I feel you will be helped by this eclipse.</p>

<p>Now let’s turn back to another topic for this month, your home. You seem to have a lot going on, and there will be people and noise, so I’m not sure if you simply have company, family coming over to stay with you, or plans to move or renovate. You may also be expecting a furniture delivery or working on redecorating. If you are hoping to move in with your romantic partner, be sure you know each other well. Saturn, the planet that teaches us life lessons, is traveling with Mars. If you are serious about moving in together, don’t give up your own place. Always keep your own apartment or house, and rent it out to a friend if you need the income. Have an agreement drawn up by your lawyer to give to your sweetheart before moving in.</p>
<p>A contract makes sure all parties know the rules of the agreement and is helpful in avoiding future problems if one person or the other originally had different assumptions.</p>
<p>In many states in the US, including where I live in New York City, if you invite someone to live with you and later change your mind and ask politely for your partner to move out, this can create difficulties (as hard as it may be to imagine now). Eviction won’t work because after 30 days your guest has what the law calls “squatter’s rights.” This means your guest has the right to stay with you as a tenant, even if they are not giving you a penny to cover rent, common charges, food, or any other living expenses.</p>

        <p>These real estate laws were originally meant to protect the poor who fell on hard times and could not afford their rent, but slackers have taken advantage of those laws. Those laws are finally poised to change in some, but not all states. I am not sure how laws are written in your city if you live outside the US. In the US, as things stand now, it could take up to three years to get the courts to hear your case to finally evict a person you don’t want in your home. Even if you are in love (actually, especially if you are in love), have your lawyer draw up a simple contract.</p>
<p>Now, let’s move to a brilliant, wonderful aspect coming on April 20 involving your ruler good-fortune Jupiter and surprise planet Uranus. The last time these two planets met was in January 2011. The next time they meet will be in September 2037. As you see, because these planets are slow moving titans of the solar system, they only have the ability to meet every 13 years. Jupiter and Uranus will conjoin only once this year, in Taurus, on April 20.</p>
<p>These two planets will meet in your sixth house, which rules work projects. If you work for yourself, this means business will be brisk all month, for these two planets will be “within orb” for much longer than one day. If you work for others, the projects will be interesting and will likely teach you something new. You may be able to hire help—you may need it to get the work out the door.</p>
<p>This conjunction of April 20 will not only help you enjoy your work in April (and in May, too) but will also have an uplifting effect on your health. If you have been concerned about your health, this alignment is one of the best possible aspects you could ever hope to see. The planet of surprise is here—you and your doctors may be amazed how nicely you recover.</p>

        <p>We have a full moon coming up in Scorpio on April 23, and it will fall in your twelfth house of behind-the-scenes activities. This full moon won’t be an eclipse, so it might be easier to experience. Still, you may hear a secret come out, for Pluto in Aquarius will be in very hard angle to the full moon in Scorpio and to the Sun in Taurus. There is some indication you might have to close a deal and sign a contract (Mercury goes direct by April 25), but the negotiation won’t go smoothly. You may have your hands full with a client who demands a lot but wants to pay little. If anyone can handle this challenge, it is you.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may simply want to hibernate inside and get much needed rest. With so much going on in your life this month, everyone will understand why hiding out sounds so good.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You have a crowd of heavenly bodies in your fifth house of true love, all in the adventuresome, stimulating sign of Aries. If you are single, you are likely enjoying the thrill of the chance for romance. If you have not met anyone yet, the new moon total solar eclipse in Aries on April 8 will increase your chances of having that fateful meeting. You would most likely meet in a setting close to home, possibly at a social event such as a party.</p>
<p>If you have been dating one particular person seriously, the question of marriage will either come up, or at least cross your mind, this month. This is complicated by Saturn’s recent entry into your home sector (March 2023 for a three-year stay)—you seem to want a permanent home and a place where you can put down roots, which is unusual for you, the quintessential international traveler. Still, having a home will offer a foundation on which to build a stable lifestyle, and it does not preclude the occasional travel that is so important to you.</p>

        <p>Your marriage sector will soon host your ruler Jupiter, the good fortune planet (beginning in late May and for one year beyond), so you need to know how you feel about your partner and eventually making a commitment to each other.</p>
<p>Mercury is the key planet that will reflect your thinking about marriage, as Mercury not only rules your prestigious career status (tenth house), but also your seventh house of marriage. Mercury waffles, going in and out of retrograde throughout the year, and Mercury is retrograding this month from April 1 to April 25. It appears that one minute you feel sure this person is for you, and the next minute, you are not so sure, and you long for the independence you have always enjoyed.</p>
<p>You are one sign that prizes your freedom, and you make it a priority to feel unfettered. You like having privacy and not having to answer to anyone about the decisions you make. On the other hand, you realize that there are wonderful parts to being partnered, too. For one, marriage can bring a chance to start a family and, if all goes well, to enjoy a rich emotional future with a steady flow of affection and a warm sense of security.</p>
<p>For now, you are not ready to make this decision, but you might find the question filtering through your thinking occasionally. With Mercury retrograde, your judgment is not working at full capacity. There’s no reason to force yourself to make a decision, especially since your partner is not yet asking for an answer.</p>
<p>If you are married, things are about to get very romantic between you and your partner, partly because your partner is about to prosper quite a bit (the most in over a decade), and you will benefit too, of course. You can take that special trip abroad and maybe splurge on lovely accommodations.</p>

        <p>With four heavenly bodies filling your fifth house, you or your partner could suddenly find out one of you is expecting. Be careful if you are not ready, but if you are, get ready to welcome a darling baby to your household.</p>
<p>For now, no matter what your marital status, plan to have fun. Take off the cloak of daily cares, and let that heavy burden drop to the ground. Having fun will be the magical glue that can bond the two of you together even closer than before.</p>
<p>If you are artistic, the eclipse may bring you a major project that would be quite exciting and could come to you out of the blue, in other words quite suddenly.</p>
<p>You also seem to want to move house eventually, but with Saturn conjunct Mars in April, you are in a holding pattern and not able to press forward. Besides, you may be unsure of exactly what type of living quarters you want and where you’d ideally like to live. Again, slow down, as there is no rush to decide these things.</p>
<p>In the meantime, your work is going exceedingly well. Business is brisk, and all in all, things might be going better than you expected. Also, as a result of the new moon solar eclipse on April 8, you will be given a chance to work on a highly creative project. Make sure you ask many questions about what the client needs, or you may have to backtrack later—keep the lines of communication open.</p>

        <p>At work you may be offered the chance to work on a new and possibly technological project. This could be related to A.I., a digital game, movie, or something so new the public hasn’t even heard about it yet. This will excite you. This month, even though Mercury is retrograde, the news is likely to be just what you were hoping to hear.</p>
<p>Put a circle around Saturday April 20, plus or minus two days, when good-fortune Jupiter and surprise-a-minute Uranus—two titans of the solar system—will align in your project sector. A new assignment could spontaneously come up, and it should be one that pays well, too. This project will be exciting because it might be just your cup of tea. This is a rare aspect, not to occur again until 2037 (in a different sign). Everyone will love this aspect, but you will enjoy it more because your ruler Jupiter will be involved.</p>
<p>By the time of the full moon on April 23 (not an eclipse), you will crave privacy and rest. Take the chance, for you will have had a busy month. You may be signing papers at this time, but settling on an agreement will be difficult due to the position of Pluto. Like everything else this month, delays will benefit you. Have faith—May will be enchanting for you.</p>
