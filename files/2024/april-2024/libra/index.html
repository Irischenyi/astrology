        <p>Something exciting seems to be cooking in your horoscope regarding your marriage or your participation in another type of committed partnership. Your spouse or steady sweetheart appears to be going through an exceptional period of growth and prosperity in their career and soon will likely have a great deal of good news to share. (If your partner is a Leo, Virgo, Taurus, or Gemini, double what I just said.) If you are not attached to anyone romantically, then this emphasis may point to a business collaboration that you will be doing with likely a superb outcome.</p>
<p>As a Libra, you work well in a partnership situation. In fact, you are the most ideal partner—one who listens, contributes, and finds a way to use the best of both partners’ ideas and swirl them into one cohesive whole. You teach the other zodiac signs how to “dance” with a partner without stepping on each other’s toes, but instead, create a beautiful, smooth dance that is a wonder to watch.</p>
<p>You have an enormous emphasis on your seventh house of marriage and business partnership now because the new moon solar eclipse—a total eclipse of the Sun—will appear on April 8 in Aries at 19 degrees. This lovely new moon eclipse will open opportunities almost immediately to form new alliances or new ways you can make more of an existing committed relationship. You may get engaged or married soon, or as said, your spouse may have exciting news to share, and as a couple, you will benefit from your partner’s success.</p>
<p>If you are not married and not seriously and exclusively dating someone you love, the April 8 eclipse will more likely affect you in relation to one or more business collaborations and partnerships. (If you ARE married or seriously attached, this eclipse could go either way—be business-oriented, personal, or both.) All the planets in your chart are based in the western part of the chart—pointing to working with others, not alone, to make your greatest successes—so you will be eager to team up.</p>

        <p>You will need a partner or middleman, and at least one will appear with the arrival of the eclipse April 8 and the days that follow. You may hire and work with an expert like a publicist, advertising specialist, accountant, lawyer, other professional, or with a client. Or in your personal life, take the next step in a relationship. If you are already married, the best use of this sparkling energy will want to make more of your marriage by working together on a new goal.</p>
<p>Venus is Libra’s guardian (ruling) planet, so let’s see how Venus is behaving in the horoscope at eclipse time, April 8.</p>
<p>Venus will be one of the four heavenly bodies in fire-sign Aries, filling your solar seventh house of marriage and partnerships. The others will be the Sun, new moon eclipse, and Mercury.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the same time as the eclipse, Pluto will be in friendly air-sign Aquarius, having recently settled into that sign and your fifth house of “true love-new love.” At eclipse time, Pluto will reach out to Venus in a very sexy, warm, passionate way. Pluto and Venus are setting up a direct line between love (fifth house) and marriage (seventh house), so you could be getting engaged at (or soon after) this special and very positive April 8 eclipse.</p>
<blockquote><p>With the rare Jupiter-Uranus meeting Ap<wbr />ril 20, a large sum of money may be on its way to you outside of your salary. This is money you won’t expect.</p></blockquote>

        <p>The conception, birth, and care for children also forms part of the fifth house. You may be thinking that this might be the time to start your family, and a pregnancy now might sound like good idea after this eclipse arrives April 8. Or if you already have your children, you may want to do something special for them, or for one, such as take your child on a trip or give him or her special classes.</p>
<p>If you are not currently in love and have no interest in getting married or in having children, you may experience the eclipse in a different way. This magical fifth house, where Pluto is based, also rules your creativity and artistic expression. Pluto, a powerhouse financial planet will be in sweet angle to other planets as they continue to rotate through the zodiac’s constellations. As this process occurs over time, Pluto can make you quite famous for your creativity. In fact, in coming years you may find your true vocation and “calling” now that Pluto is in your solar fifth house for the first time in your life. (Pluto takes 248 years to circle the Sun and visit all 12 signs, so you’ve never had Pluto in your solar fifth house.)</p>
<p>You may have never realized that you have artistic or creative talent, and if you discover the joy your latent talent gives you and begin to express it, you may become determined to find ways to develop it. This can happen in tandem with your current career or involve you switching careers and subsequently devoting yourself fully to your craft. I am not saying this is going to happen for you, but it could.</p>
<p>If you feel the pull toward creativity now or in the future, you should follow that inclination. Pluto is set to stay in your fifth house of artistic expression until January 2044, 20 years from now. The idea of having a “second act” might sound intriguing.</p>
<p>You hear stories of exciting talent being discovered later in life in the news. Sharon Stone, the actress, decided to take up painting and revealed breathtaking talent in her work. Her paintings are now displayed in museums and sold in galleries worldwide. Former President Bush surprised everyone when he began to paint after he left the Oval Office. His family says his work gives him great joy and was reported in the news as remarkably good and unique. When Major League Baseball star Randy Johnson (who was inducted into the Hall of Fame) retired, still in excellent shape, he became a celebrated international travel photographer. Randy Johnson’s work of people, places, and animals, particularly in Africa and other locations, made news and brought exhibits. This goes to prove—we can do more than one thing in life.</p>

        <p>Pluto is newly minted in this artistic area of your chart, having entered Aquarius in January 2024, and with only one exception (September 1 to November 19, 2024) when Pluto will make a short retrograde back to Capricorn, Pluto will remain in Aquarius and your house of true love, children, and creativity from now until 2044, 20 years from now. Pluto is so powerful that he is said to be positively life-changing in his influence, and you are fortunate to have Pluto in such a lovely part of your solar chart for the coming two decades. Also, Pluto is in fellow air-sign Aquarius, so he will eventually be perfectly trine your Sun or rising sign, which is the most heavenly aspect possible. (Those readers born September 22-25, or have Libra rising from 0 to 2 degrees, have this now.)</p>
<p>I feel you will love the effects of the eclipse because as a Libra, you are the most skilled of any sign at working in collaboration or negotiating with another person in business. You also are known to greatly value marriage, and you aim to be fair and encouraging to your partner, the reason many Libras stay in long-term, strong marriages.</p>
<p>The Libras who will feel the effects of the eclipse April 8 the most are the ones who were born on October 12, plus or minus four days, or have Libra rising or your natal moon in Libra at 19 degrees, plus or minus four degrees. If you have a planet in Aries, Leo, Sagittarius, Gemini, Libra, or Aquarius at 19 degrees, plus or minus four degrees, you will also feel this eclipse because that planet will be lit up.</p>
<p>You appear to be working very hard this month, racking up plenty of applause and praise for your rich imagination and ideas that you bring to the table. Mars is traveling arm in arm with Saturn, an indication of how deeply you are concentrating on all you have to do.</p>

        <p>Mars and Saturn are orbiting in your work-a-day sixth house, which affects everyday projects, the tools you use to do your work (including possible use of software, A.I., computers, gadgets, machinery, and more). The sixth house also includes the human resources you need to get the job done (the team). This house is not attached to your career, reputation, and advancement, but of course, if you do a great job, each success will likely lead to professional reward.</p>
<p>Here is the interesting twist to the story. From Pisces, Mars will reach out to Jupiter, the planet of good fortune, and Uranus, the planet of all unexpected developments, both in Taurus and your financial eighth house of other people’s money. This will happen on April 19-20, and you may feel this two days prior, April 17, or as late as Monday, April 22.</p>
<p>It looks like as a result of Jupiter’s meeting with Uranus, a large sum of money is on the way to you. This money is tied to your work, but not to your regular weekly salary or a raise. It could come as a commission, royalty, or a special one-time fee for an assignment, especially if you are self-employed. It could be a bonus. The delicious part about this event is that you won’t expect this money.</p>
<p>In case you assume that this conjunction of good-fortune Jupiter and surprise-a-minute Uranus is a commonplace aspect, it’s not—Jupiter has not met with Uranus since 2011! This year, these benefic planets will meet only once, and the next time this conjunction will occur (in a different sign and place in your chart) will be in September 2037.</p>

        <p>Watch the time near April 20, but I should add that, in truth, Jupiter and Uranus are slow-moving planets and have been significantly close almost all month. If you begin to see that you are a money magnet in April, wait—May will bring much more money! May will be your best month of the year for seeing large chucks of money find their way to your bank account. On May 25, Jupiter will leave this financial part of your chart and enter Gemini (another good spot for you). Before Jupiter leaves, the little planets have planned quite a send-off party for Jupiter, and you will benefit.</p>
<p>Money should come to you as a fee or bonus for work well done, but there is another way you could see cash this month. You may get an infusion of funds if you pitched a venture capitalist earlier or applied for a bank loan or business line of credit. You may receive an insurance payout near April 20 if you sent in a claim earlier. You get the idea—the money is not related to your regular salary but represent money that comes to you outside of salary.</p>
<p>I should mention that the eighth house is also related to surgery, both medical and dental in nature. It looks like if you do need surgery of any kind, and you have a choice of when to do it, the first three week of May would be ideal. In May Jupiter will still be in your eighth house, so you have a strong chance of a successful outcome. Jupiter is the great healer and is also said to be the planet of miracles. As this same house rules financials, it also seems likely that your health insurance will cover your procedure entirely—maybe even the medicine. It would be a good idea to call in advance, however, and speak to your insurance provider to be sure. Insurance companies love to hear from subscribers ahead of their procedures.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Mercury will be retrograde nearly all month—from April 1 to April 25, but with such wonderful aspects, especially affecting your eighth financial house, I don’t feel that the normal inconveniences that Mercury retrograde customarily brings will be of too much concern.</p>

        <p>A full moon (not an eclipse) will arrive on April 23 in Scorpio at 4 degrees and light your second house of salary, savings, and personal possessions. This full moon poses a conflict from Pluto in Aquarius, which will tightly challenge the Sun in your eighth house of other people’s money, and the full moon in your second house of earned income.</p>
<p>You may have wanted to send money to pay for a cottage rental for part of the coming summer, or if you live below the equator, the coming winter (perhaps to go skiing). Or you may have wanted to put a large deposit toward sending your child to summer camp or to get a tutor for him but can’t. You seem to have a financial obligation that will take precedence and much be paid first, such as to pay taxes, a credit card bill, or an unanticipated repair for your car or house, as three examples.</p>
<p>Don’t lose hope, however. Over April 19 and 20, as said, you have Mars in your work-a-day house contacting Jupiter, a once-every-two-year aspect that is just fabulous, Mars contacting Uranus, and the spectacular Jupiter-Uranus conjunction all in your second financial house. So you could very well have money come from a work assignment that will not only take care of your obligation but allow you to pay for what you had originally planned to do, too.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>As a Libra, you love to be coupled up, not only in marriage, but also as a partner in business. Libras are very talented at making introductions to bring together people they feel should know one another and work together, for each would contribute to the other’s success.</p>

        <p>This month a new moon solar eclipse on April 8 will focus on a partnership that is either in place now or that will soon form. This is a very positive eclipse that will come laden with golden opportunity. If you are married, your other half will come to you with exciting news that would affect you both. If you are dating, you may get a proposal.</p>
<p>Looking closer, this eclipse on April 8 in Aries seems to focus more on your work life than on your personal life. If you are a writer, for example, you may take a writing partner to create your idea for a screenplay. Alternatively, you may hire an agent to represent you to the major motion picture studios. You might hire a new lawyer whose specialty you need, as another example. If you are self-employed, you may have a chance to set up a joint collaboration between your company and another company that would be mutually beneficial.</p>
<p>Mercury will be retrograde in your seventh house of marriage and partnership almost all month, from April 1 to April 25, and the house of partnership and marriage is basically a contractual house, where both parties make solemn promises to each other. For now, move slowly. Do not rush to sign a contract.</p>
<p>It’s a good time to talk and to explore ways the April 8 eclipse can help you, but it is not quite yet the time to etch anything in stone.</p>
<p>As Mercury will be in retrograde from April 1 to April 25, this would be a time to wait to do research, to test assumptions, and set up your blueprints. Wait until May to launch, for May will be an outstandingly rewarding month financially. Be patient, dear Libra.</p>

        <p>There is a possibility that you may have almost worked with someone in a close collaboration some time ago, but for some reason, the partnership did not take place. Now you may be able to reunite and work together with success.</p>
<p>Or you may have actually worked with this person and now decide to make a new contact to work together again. If you once created magical results together, chances are you can a second time. Situations like these—going back to the past—often work out well when Mercury is in retrograde.</p>
<p>The April 8 eclipse might bring the need for a dental or medical procedure or surgery. With Jupiter in your eighth house, you have the good luck planet in the best place to help you get a successful result. If you need surgery during Mercury retrograde, do it. We often fix what was broken or out of whack during retrograde periods. If you have elective surgery that can wait (not like a hurting tooth, of course), then plan it for the first three weeks of May.</p>
<p>Work has been strenuous for you, for you have Mars bringing you a lot of assignments, and you have had to keep your concentration sharp. You may also have had to hire temporary or permanent help to get all the work out the door. This trend will ease a bit on the work front once Mars leaves Pisces on April 30. At that time the partnership theme, so evident now, will become even more apparent in May, and you will be able to finally move ahead assertively.</p>
<p>April 19 could become a superb day to make a big sale or to get approval to hire more help at the office. Mars will contact Jupiter in a very beneficial way—your ability to attract money on this day will be strong. Actions you plan for on or near April 19 may lead to big profits.</p>

        <p>Keep an eye on April 20 too, a potentially huge day when Jupiter and Uranus will make a historic conjunction (not to happen again until September 2037). Jupiter is the giver of gifts and luck, and Uranus is the planet of surprise—and both will be beautifully conjoined in your financial house on April 20. Use this day to “shop for money”—ask for a bank loan, send a claim to an insurance company, ask for university financial aid, make a pitch for venture capital, or pitch and make a big sale on this day.</p>
<p>Your aspects for making money have never been better, but the full moon on April 23 in Scorpio may bring a hiccup in a negotiation. You may encounter a disagreement with the person who holds the purse strings, and the point of contention seems to involve a creative project. Or if you hoped to use a sum of money for a vacation or to care for your child, you may find you have to pay the government for taxes first or a credit card bill that is higher than you expected.</p>
<p>If you are interviewing for a new job near the full moon April 23 and you can’t get the salary you want (you might get it, but if not&#8230;), ask if you can work on a performance basis, on commission or royalty or get a year-end bonus. If that is not possible, when deciding whether or not to take the job, at home, examine the list of available company benefits that you might be given—those are valuable too, especially if you would have to pay for them yourself. Ask your employer to help with partial graduate school tuition if you promise to stay with the firm a certain amount of time.</p>
<p>These are some examples to get you thinking. Your chart shows that your eighth house, the area that rules other people’s money, is lit up brilliantly. Be confident, dear Libra—when it comes to money, the angels are on your side.</p>
<p>And be excited about May—your best month of 2024! It’s absolutely sensational for everyone! Be sure to come back to read it!</p>
