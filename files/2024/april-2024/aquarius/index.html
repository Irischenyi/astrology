        <p>You have been tied to your home and possibly family, too, for months, but in April, you will be able to take a break. You probably heard on TV that a major solar eclipse is due on April 8, and it will be a total eclipse from Texas to Maine in the United States, so you may be taking a trip to a city in that path of totality. NASA has a site (<a href="https://tinyurl.com/yspyt978">https://tinyurl.com/yspyt978</a>) where you can see the path of the eclipse and you will see a box under the map that lists the best cities for viewing and the time the eclipse will pass overhead.</p>
<p>For you, Aries and your third house of travel and communication will be lit up. This is why I feel you might travel in April. Along with the eclipsed new moon will be found the Sun, Venus, and Mercury all in adventuresome Aries. I feel you will go to a city not too far from your base, one that is quite scenic, warm and sunny—Venus is, after all, one of the planets following the eclipse, and she will add beauty to your destination.</p>
<p>Mercury will be retrograde in Aries from April 1 to April 25, so if you do take a road trip, make sure you have checked your accommodations to be sure they are set in stone, even if you arrive late. If you fly, call the airport the day before to find out if any delays are possible. Make sure you have packed all necessary paperwork, checked your accommodations the night before you go, and have Apple Air Tags in your luggage. (No one paid me to suggest Air Tags—I love them. It’s a good idea to have them to track your luggage.)</p>
<p>If you plan to drive to see the eclipse, make sure there is no cloud cover predicted at your destination. If a cloud cover is forecast, you may not see nearly a much. Alas, this can be frustrating. I am staying home in New York City, and by some miracle, it is predicted to be sunny and bright, possibly as warm at 65 degrees. We might luck out here! We will only see 90% of totality, but that is good enough for me.</p>

        <p>Neither the Sun nor the new moon eclipse of April 8 are making any important, major aspects to other planets, and that is a bit unusual, but they will still exert an influence in your third house. However, Pluto will reach out to Venus in a very warm and friendly way, suggesting you could fly away further afield if you really wanted to do so—and enjoy it in the process.</p>
<p>You may be working on writing or editing an important document or preparing a speech or lecture to give to a group. If you are a lawyer, you may be working on your opening and closing statements that will make or break your case. Alternatively, you could be working on an A.I. project, the design and implementation of a new app, or the redesign of a large company website that’s in the media business. Whatever you will be involved in seems very new, giving you the role of pathfinder into a new branch of your specialty.</p>
<p>Mars is the leader of this solar new moon eclipse in Aries, and Mars is currently in your second house of earned income, savings, profits on investments, and possessions. Mars will reach out to both Jupiter and Uranus, who are traveling together in your fifth house of creativity, which tells me you may be working on a highly imaginative assignment, and one that will pay well, too. Uranus will bring up the project suddenly.</p>
<blockquote><p>April 20 is a day to look forward to! It will lift your spirits and make you feel quite optimistic.</p></blockquote>

        <p>This is good timing, for with Mars’ tour of your solar second house of earned income since March 22, Mars forced up your spending, and you may be a little concerned about the drain you are experiencing with all the check writing. You have Saturn in this same area, which adds to holding the line on expenses difficult. These high expenses will lessen after Mars leaves Pisces on April 30, providing you some relief. You may feel more in control of your finances.</p>
<p>Saturn will remain where he is now (your financial second house) until February 2026, and alas, Saturn is also making it harder than usual for you to get your salary requirements approved by prospective employers or to get a generous raise from your present employer. If you change jobs, Saturn would follow you there. If you are self-employed, you may find clients balk when you gently raise your fees or prices.</p>
<p>If you speak to your friends, particularly if your friend is an Aries or a Libra, you will hear they have no trouble getting paid the salary they feel they deserve. This is so frustrating, I am sure, for you! Until Saturn leaves in February 2026, you will be dealing with tight-fisted employers and clients.</p>
<p>Here is the point of Saturn’s visit to your financial second house. Saturn is trying to teach you the value of money, of being thrifty, of negotiating confidently, and for finding sources with good prices. As an Aquarius, you are not naturally materialistic. You can be happy with your electronics, and you see no need to live in a mansion—all you need is consistent WIFI. (I am joking, but you can recognize the truth here—your sign is not known to spend money with abandon—you tend to be careful.)</p>

        <p>For the past year, you have hosted Jupiter, the good fortune planet, in your fourth house of home and family, so you may have been rivetted on improving your home surroundings or making changes in your family. You also may have been focused on a new baby (yours or that of a close relative) or other family member, such as on one of your parents who needed your assistance.</p>
<p>Alternatively, much of the money you have been spending may have gone into real estate or improvements to a property, such as refurbishing, renovating, redesigning, or refreshing the décor. Jupiter is set to leave Taurus and this part of your chart (fourth house) next month on May 25 when Jupiter will move into Gemini. Before that happens, the other little planets have planned a magnificent going-away party for Jupiter. This is the reason May will be so spectacular for you. Everyone of every sign will likely enjoy the benefits and gifts of next month, and for you, your home and family will be the focus.</p>
<p>But wait—the universe planned a big celebration day THIS month too, on April 20, and it is also related to Jupiter in his last days of Taurus. The event that is coming is quite historic, when Jupiter, the planet of good fortune, combines forces with Uranus, the planet of surprise. What a joyous aspect this should be!</p>
<p>Jupiter and Uranus have not conjoined since 2011 and will not do so again until September 2037. All the hard work you did to improve your property or to strengthen those bonds you have with your family seems to come to a surprising reward. Watch what happens—these two planets are extremely slow moving, so the influence of this aspect will spread wide, possibly over all of April, but will be especially strong from April 18 to April 22. April 20 is a day to look forward to! It will lift your spirits and make you feel quite optimistic.</p>

        <p>The full moon of April 23 will be in Scorpio, 4 degrees. It will light your tenth house of professional honors, awards, and achievement—your prestigious career house. This area of your chart rewards leadership and contribution to your industry and community at large. Full moons bring something to a finish. If you have been interviewing for a position, you may now get an offer. Still, something is weirdly off.</p>
<p>Pluto in Aquarius will be in a hard square (90-degree angle) to the full moon in Scorpio AND to the Sun in Taurus. All three of these signs are fixed signs, and you seem to want to negotiate terms, but doing so will be like running up against a wall. Getting any changes in the deal or offer will be tough, for with three fixed signs making up the aspects to this this full moon, neither side will be inclined to give an inch. Maybe the salary is too little, or you would be required to move, and uprooting right now might sound overwhelming. There is something about this full moon that seems to make you think twice about taking any offer. If you don’t get an offer, don’t be sad—you probably wouldn’t have liked it.</p>
<p>You will get a better opportunity to change jobs at the new moon in Scorpio on November 1 later this year—it will be a peach, with only good news, no drawbacks at all!</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You have been nearly obsessed with improving the look and feel of your living space, and for good reason. Uranus, your ruler and the planet known to bring sudden news, is two-thirds of the way through his long multi-year journey of your home sector (fourth house). Uranus first entered this area of your chart in 2018 and will finally leave for good in 2026, not to return until 2102—78 years from now (it takes Uranus 84 years to go through all 12 signs).</p>

        <p>At several points during the past five years, you’ve likely had many memorable experiences. At the same time, you may have been rocked with completely unexpected changes regarding your living quarters or other property you may own or rent. Or instead, you may have had to attend to the needs of a family member who was grateful for your care—things could have come up suddenly from time to time.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may have seen additional, unexpected changes in the makeup of your immediate family. To add even more activity to this one part of your chart, starting in November 2021 and continuing until October 2023, you hosted several eclipses in Taurus, your home and family sector, and in Scorpio, triggering more unpredictable news due to the unfortunate position of your ruler Uranus at those eclipses. Soon the changes on the domestic front will be finished, so you can finally make plans without fear that your world would suddenly turn upside down without warning (as has been the case).</p>
<p>Things started to get much better as of last year in May 2023, when Jupiter, the planet of happiness, growth, and luck, entered this area of home and family in your chart. Jupiter offers still another reason you have been so focused on home and family, but this time with the chance to make wonderful improvements to move or to improve your living quarters and to enjoy family.</p>
<p>Jupiter has spent 11 months in this area of your chart, so the changes you are making are ones you will enjoy with great pride for many years. If you own your house or apartment, your refinements, repairs, and renovations will work to make your home more valuable.</p>

        <p>Whether you were buying, selling, renovating, decorating, or cleaning and maintaining property, in April you will get a chance now to take a break.</p>
<p>You currently have a gaggle of planets in your third house of communication and short, quick travel. The total eclipse of the Sun on April 8 (a powerful new moon) plus the Sun, Mercury, and Venus, will all be in that house and the adventuresome sign of Aries. You can plan a “stay-cation” where you remain home, taking life slow and easy, or you might go to a nearby resort where you can enjoy being in the outdoors in the sunshine, breathing in fresh air, hiking or rock climbing, camping, biking, or swimming. Maybe you can take time to visit a spa.</p>
<p>Clearly, in April you have people to see and places to go. With your third house energized, you may be involved in contractual matters. This month would be an unfavorable time to sign papers as Mercury will be retrograde from April 1 to April 25. After Mercury goes direct on April 25, this planet of communication and agreements (Mercury) will need at least a week to reorient its orb to normal.</p>
<p>Planets stacking up in the third house also puts a spotlight on your sister or brother, so check in. Your sibling may have exciting news to share, or you may suggest you go into a venture together.</p>

        <p>If you travel, be back soon, for the full moon on April 23 (not an eclipse) will be in Scorpio and may bring a major offer for a promotion, new job, or news about a change in management at the top of your company.</p>
<p>Usually, a full moon like this one, activating your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement, would bring a celebratory offer to be promoted or a top job from another company. Yet this full moon of April 23 is puzzling.</p>
<p>Pluto, the lead planet here in Aquarius, will conflict with the Sun in Taurus and full moon in Scorpio, forming a harsh square aspect (90 degrees) to both. This suggests there is something wrong with the offer. The salary package may be too low. Alas, with Saturn in your second house of salary, you will find with all offers you get to be on the low side—focus instead on finding a job you would love doing.</p>
<p>If you cannot negotiate a change to make the offer more acceptable to you, then you might decide to leave the offer on the table and walk away. See how you feel. A better offer for advancement may arrive soon after the new moon November 1.</p>
