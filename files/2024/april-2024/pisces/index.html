        <p>If you have been waking up every morning saying to yourself, “I have to find a way to make more money,” it looks like the universe may have heard you and will send you opportunities to attract money. Pisces is not considered a materialistic sign, for you put your emphasis on the quality of the goods and services that you create, not on the money. The money comes to you anyway because you have the right focus.</p>
<p>This must be why in 2023 Forbes magazine names Pisces the second most likely zodiac sign to be a billionaire. In a study, Pisces comprised 11% of billionaires in the world. (Libra was first with 12%. See https://fortune.com/2023/02/17/billionaires-zodiac-sign-capricorn-libra.) Year after year, Pisces ranks either on top or near the top. I feel if Steve Jobs, a Pisces and creator of Apple, had not died so young (at age 56 in October 2011), he would have pushed Pisces’ rank to the very top.</p>
<p>In your quest to find more money, see what happens at or soon after the total eclipse of the Sun—a powerful new moon due in Aries, 19 degrees, on April 8. At that time, you will have a lot of energy in your second house of earned income from the new moon, Sun, Mercury, and Venus. A new moon in your personal salary, savings, and possessions sector always marks the possibility for change and growth.</p>
<p>Mercury is retrograde most of April, from April 1 to April 25, in Aries, this very same financial part of your chart. This could mean that a client or employer of your past might re-emerge and present a possibility to work together again. That would work out well, too.</p>

        <p>If you work in sales, this is definitely a good time to review the list of supporters who you worked with in the past to create new business. If you need to sign a major contract, see a lawyer, or make any necessary changes to the clauses, plan to sign in May. Next month is due to be a glorious month for you on many levels.</p>
<p>Pluto, a heavy-duty financial planet based in your behind-the-scenes sector (twelfth house), will contact Venus in a friendly sextile aspect (indicating opportunity) at the time of the eclipse, April 8.</p>
<p>Venus is traveling in your second house of earned income but Venus RULES your solar eighth house of other people’s money. This suggests you may get a sum of money from one of these types of sources: a tax refund, gift, inheritance, court settlement, divorce agreement of a division of property, insurance payout, venture capital, commission, royalty, bonus, or other one-time bundle of cash. Both your financial sectors are lit up for different reasons, but each area suggests you will soon see upbeat financial results.</p>

        <p>Often at eclipse time the universe will ask you to sacrifice something, and in this case it could be one source of income. If you are self-employed, it might mean that one long-time client would leave. If you work for others, the company may be streamlining personnel to cut back.</p>
<p>You may have already seen this to be true because an eclipse can deliver part of its news one month to the day before the eclipse appears, so that would have happened last month on March 8 (plus or minus five days). Sometimes an eclipse will deliver its message one month to the day later (May 8) with the same tolerance of days (plus or minus five days).</p>
<p>If you recently were crushed by losing a long-time client or job for an employer, that is common. The universe is trying to make room in your basket for the exciting new options that are coming. When that happens to me, I call it the sacrificial lamb required by the eclipse. As you see, it’s a time of change, but you will likely wind up with more money than you had before.</p>
<p>You currently have been hosting Saturn in Pisces for the first time in 29 years. Saturn is the teacher planet and can be a stern taskmaster. There is no doubt you are handling all you need to do, but it can be exhausting. You must protect your health, for Saturn can run you down. Ask your doctor if you need vitamins as Saturn is known to drain calcium reserves, often boosted by vitamin D. Your doctor is the boss here—it’s a good idea to check.</p>

        <p>Saturn is moving very swiftly and is now at 14 to 16 degrees Pisces, highlighting readers with birthdays that range from March 5 to March 7. Responsibilities are piling up, so if you were born during these dates, you will need to take breaks and pace yourself. Pisces born in February and up to March 4 have completed the hardest part of their bootcamp with Saturn.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you have Mars in your sign until April 30, a privilege you get every two years. Mars is making you more confident, assertive, and courageous, and you are likely to get the attention of the VIPs you need to see. Mars is traveling with Saturn this month, so your actions will be well considered and deliberate.</p>
<p>Both planets, Mars and Saturn, are reaching out to Jupiter and Uranus in a beautiful way, and Jupiter and Uranus are both in your third house of communication. It appears you have grown in sophistication when it comes to writing, speaking, editing, coding, translating, and other communication arts or in doing research. Now the hard work you’ve done to hone your skills, reaching as far back as last May 2023, will bring you reward.</p>
<p>You may get your book published or your screenplay optioned by a movie studio. You may design a new app that you will soon put on the market or delve into A.I., either to develop a new part of it or to see how it can help you in your everyday work. You might land a major client who wants you to design their advertising campaign or a publicity program for them, you may be tasked to work on a client’s social media presence, or you may start a series of podcasts. These are some examples to get you thinking.</p>

        <p>See what happens in the realm of communication on or near a very big day, Saturday, April 20. Jupiter will make a historic conjunction to Uranus, and this is the only date they will meet in 2024. This will be the first time Jupiter has met with his old friend Uranus since January 2011, and they will not meet again until September 2037.</p>
<p>Jupiter is the planet of good fortune, and Uranus is the planet of surprise, so you may be amazed when you get a plumb communication-oriented assignment near this date. Uranus and Jupiter are slow-moving little snails, and being they will only meet once—on April 20—you can theoretically feel their influence the entire month, but especially the dates surrounding April 20, from April 18 to 22. It is also possible you will travel unexpectedly and spontaneously, most likely for business, but it could be for personal fun, too.</p>
<p>On April 23 we have a full moon in Scorpio, 4 degrees, that will fall in your ninth house of foreign people and places, the import-export of ideas, goods and services, matters related to broadcasting, publishing, legal matters, and those related to the pursuit of higher education. Something in one of these areas is reaching an end.</p>
<p>Pluto, however, from your hidden twelfth house, will be in hard angle to both the moon in Scorpio and the Sun in Taurus, adding strong force. Both the Sun and full moon areas of your chart involve intellect, learning, and communication. A contract may be ending.</p>

        <p>Pluto is known to represent super strong, powerful VIPs involved with money matters. It’s hard to say who is pulling the strings because Pluto is behind the scenes in your solar chart. I am not sure you will be able to find out why this association is ending, but it seems to do with a budget cut, even if you are not told it’s about money. They may say that they are going in another direction, but that seems not to be the case—they are running low on money.</p>
<p>I think this is the source of income I suspected earlier in your report you would see ending, which may (or many not) happen at this time. The moon is linked to your creativity, and the Sun is linked to your daily projects, so it does look like a long-term assignment is coming to an end. Remember, something better is coming—that is how eclipses work.</p>
<p>Your reputation will remain strong and intact, for Saturn is well-angled to the full moon. In fact, if others hear you are not linked to this one client or company anymore, they will probably want you in their corner. The universe does not like to see empty spaces.</p>
<p>In terms of romance, your presence will be highly magnetic, and you will be viewed as ultra-attractive, too. Thank Mars in Pisces for this. He’ll be in your sign all month.</p>
<p>Your most romantic night will happen on April 3 when Venus and Neptune combine in a magical, enchanting evening just made for love. The sky above will twinkle with thousands of stars shining just for you and the one you love. Are you single? This night is still quite special and glamourous, but you will have other opportunities in May, too.</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You may hear wonderful news about money that will be coming to you just after the total eclipse of the Sun in Aries, arriving April 8. A solar eclipse is a new moon on steroids, so this is an important date to watch for happy news. Your solar second house of earned income will contain the Sun and new moon, Mercury, and Venus, and that adds up to a lot of positive energy in this financial area of your chart. Eclipses always signal change, and in this case, you may see a new job or project that will pay you a generous sum or, if you work for an employer, be given a substantial raise in salary.</p>
<p>Mars will be the dominant planet at this eclipse of April 8 and is now in your sign, Pisces, and receiving elegant rays from benefic Jupiter in your agreement sector (third house). Having Mars in your sign is, by itself, a wonderful advantage—you will feel energized, focused, courageous, and determined—few people could say “no” to you. With Mars reaching out to Uranus, work may come up to tap your creativity and stylishness, and that is precisely what you love most.</p>
<p>On Friday, April 19, when you might take a spontaneous trip, Mars, Jupiter, and Uranus will be in sync, so it’s time to have fun. Earlier in the month, Saturn in Pisces will be orbiting tightly with Mars in Pisces, so you will have to keep your focus on work, but these two planets will gradually pull away from one another, and by April 19 will be far enough apart to release you to feel freer to move in any direction you please. Mars will reach out to Jupiter and Uranus, allowing you a little time off that you can use to unwind and play.</p>

        <p>Over the same weekend, a day to watch will be Saturday, April 20, when Jupiter and Uranus will meet in conjunction in Taurus in your third house of writing, speaking, and editing and also covers other communication arts like translation, research, sales, public relations, and marketing, including coding and the digital world. You may get a sudden, unexpected plum job project to design a website or video game, to write a screenplay, or to develop a part on A.I., as some examples. Whatever you are doing, it will come on suddenly, pay well, and make you happy. April 20 will have a plus or minus two days to deliver its news. This Jupiter-Uranus conjunction is a rare aspect, not to be repeated until September 2037 (and then in a different part of your chart). Opportunity is knocking, so keep your antennae up.</p>
<p>The full moon of April 23 will highlight distant travel and international relationships. Alternatively, it could bring news about a broadcasting or publishing project with you as a creator, or highlight publicity with you as the main subject. Your ninth house will be lit, an area that rules legal matters as well.</p>
<p>Pluto will be in hard conflict with the Sun and full moon and will apply pressure on you to comply. A court case may not go in your favor. Do not bring up any dispute near this time, or your case will be met with a great deal of pushback from the other side, and you will feel like you are fighting City Hall. Outnumbered and out flanked, it could be depressing. The best route is to accept news silently. If you need to respond, wait until well after Mercury is out of retrograde (April 25), and leave a space of days—so plan to act next month.</p>
<p>May will be your most glorious month, filled with exceptional, jewel-like aspects. It has so much news! As Jupiter prepares to leave Taurus to enter Gemini, the little planets are giving Jupiter a send-off party like none you’ve seen in recent memory. It’s a fabulous forecast you won’t want to miss!</p>
