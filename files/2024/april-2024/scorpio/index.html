        <p>You have a lot on your to-do list this month, both at home and the office, and clearly, you’ve been working hard. New projects, a change in personnel, or an announcement about updates at your company will have you paying attention to your daily workflow. This is a month to listen, reflect, but not act quite yet.</p>
<p>Mercury will be retrograde from April 1 to 25, so information may be incomplete or confusing. Take in the facts, and make no assumptions. You could hear very good news in the midst of this slightly haywire month, and this will keep you motivated and smiling all the while. You can start to plan, but be flexible as changes will come up—if you expect them, you won’t be ruffled by them.</p>
<p>Eclipses always call for some kind of adjustment, but the one on April 8 is a major, new moon total eclipse of the Sun in Aries, 19 degrees. This eclipse will be friendly, so even enforced changes (should any occur) will work to your benefit. You have a buildup of planets in your sixth house of work-a-day assignments—the new moon eclipse, the Sun, Mercury, and Venus—all in Aries. This is a solar eclipse, so although your sixth house covers your daily tasks, including those at home, changes seem to be most pronounced in your career. A person at your company who you depend on may suddenly leave.</p>
<p>Pluto, now in Aquarius, recently moved into your home sector and will be in friendly conversation with Venus in Aries, your work project zone. It looks like anything that’s going on at your office won’t disturb what is happening in your home or with your family—in fact, this part of your life seems to be protected at this eclipse.</p>

        <p>Also, Mars will reach out in a highly friendly way to Jupiter and Uranus, who are both based in your partnership sector. Mars is currently in your fifth house of love, children, and creativity, so while you may have to adjust to swift-moving changes at work, your time spent with your sweetheart and your children will be quite divine. Having a friendly Mars at the time of this eclipse is significant for two reasons: 1) Mars is in highly compatible, water-sign Pisces, and you are ruled by Mars, and 2) an eclipse in Aries puts Mars in charge. Thank goodness you have a supportive Mars!</p>
<p>With Mars reaching out to Jupiter and Uranus (orbiting arm-in-arm in Taurus), this suggests that IF (and only if) you don’t like the changes that are occurring in your daily work environment, or regarding the flow of your routine, you may be able to partner with a recruiter or job broker to find a new position. Mars will be within mathematical significance to Jupiter as early as April 8 and will make an exact aspect on April 19. From April 8 to April 19, this aspect will become increasingly strong.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, Mars will reach out to Uranus too, so you will be pleasantly surprised by how things play out. Uranus moves as slow as a little turtle, so although Mars and Uranus won’t make a perfect aspect (sextile) until April 19—the same day that Mars clicks with Jupiter—both planets will still help you in surprising ways.</p>
<blockquote><p>Keep your eye on April 20 when good-fortune Jupiter will conjoin with Uranus, the planet of surprise. This could turn out to be one of the best days of the year.</p></blockquote>

        <p>With good-fortune Jupiter in your partnership sector, you can expect great support not only from your spouse or steady, exclusive, established sweetheart but also from the experts and professionals you hire to help you.</p>
<p>These types of experts might include lawyers, accountants, doctors, agents, publicists, or recruiters. You can add more—I name these possibilities to get you thinking. These experts all are covered by your seventh house because they are all certified professionals with a specialty you might need and who would work with you in a confidential, one-to-one way. Of course, if you are married or attached, your spouse may help you with advice, an introduction, or an idea, too.</p>
<p>I don’t think you will be upset by the news of the April 8 eclipse—not at all—because this is a powerful new moon, not an emotional full moon. New moons send us in a new direction, and often, it’s a very exciting one.</p>
<p>This eclipse in Aries will likely expose you to a more advanced area of your specialty and help you venture into a fresh and exciting sector. You may extend your skills into a new branch and gain knowledge within a field that few people have, thereby raising your value in the marketplace.</p>
<p>I know you are handling a lot these days, and any news of change might initially make you want to resist it—you are a fixed sign that does not always see the need for adjustment. You might ask, “Why is this happening?” Variations can bring an improvement and an opportunity to experience something new.</p>

        <p>Aries is the sign of the entrepreneur, so some Scorpios will open their own business, if they had not already done so as a result of last year’s solar new moon eclipse in Aries on April 19, 2023.</p>
<p>Something is happening on April 20 that is quite exciting. Good-fortune Jupiter and Uranus, the planet of surprise, will make a historic conjunction in Taurus. They have not met since 2011, for they only meet every 13 years. Jupiter and Uranus will only come together once in 2024, and the next time they will meet will be September 2037. Rare events like this are usually easily noticed because they are so different from daily, normal experience.</p>
<p>An event on (or near) April 20—or at any time this month because these planets will be traveling so close to each other—will come from a partner or middleman who will link you to something you dearly want. It could be a marriage proposal (or, if you are the one asking, a “yes” from your partner), or it might be a recruiter with news of a high-level position for you to interview for. In April and May, your greatest luck will come through someone else—your spouse, established romantic partner, or an agent, lawyer, job broker, new accountant, or other professional you hire to help you advance.</p>
<p>Now we come to the full moon on April 23, which might be important to you because it will fall in Scorpio, 4 degrees. This full moon is not an eclipse, and it will help you to center yourself, even if you initially feel emotionally stirred up by any news. This full moon will encourage you to realize the elements you need in your life to be truly happy. You might change the rank of priorities you had previously held and reshuffle them to reflect the new, more mature you.</p>

        <p>Pluto in Aquarius, your home sector, will be in hard angle to the transiting Sun in Taurus and the full moon in Scorpio on April 23. Someone connected to your home, or a member of your family, might be pressuring you. This person could be your landlord, tenant, or roommate who won’t leave (or just the opposite, is leaving without warning).</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may be having problems with a contractor, architect, designer, or repairman, as a few examples. In another instance, you might suddenly be concerned about the welfare of a family member who would be grateful for your assistance or, conversely, is in conflict with a demanding relative who wants you to follow their plan and isn’t open to listening to any of your views on the matter.</p>
<p>Before you toss up your hands and scream, “Oh no! I’m doomed!”—wait. Several days prior to this full moon, as previously mentioned, Mars will form a lovely aspect with Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck. Mars will make an exact sextile on April 19, and by April 23, Mars and Jupiter will still be close enough in degree to help you.</p>
<p>Although Pluto is the instigator of the problem with this full moon and the Sun, he will be kind to Neptune, his BFF (best friend forever). This suggests that a creative, unusual idea could work, or simply being kind and polite to the person who is pressing on you unfairly may start to release the tension. Full moons are only strong for four to five days, and in that time, you will find a solution.</p>

        <p>The full moon on April 23 will mainly affect those Scorpios born on October 26, plus five days or minus two days. It will also affect you if you have Scorpio rising, 4 degrees, plus or minus four degrees.</p>
<p>Over and over, your romantic partner, business associates, or middlemen will help you untangle problems, so reach out for support if you need it.</p>
<p>Before I go, I want to mention your most romantic, fun day of the month—April 3, when Venus will conjoin Neptune in Pisces. This will be a divine, enchanting evening for you, perfect for a first date or with your spouse of many years. Everyone will benefit from the sweet glow of love that will be in the air on April 3.</p>
<p>Also, Mars is now energizing your fifth house of true love, which is sure to bring fantastic news to single and attached Scorpios alike. This is a GREAT place for Mars. He makes you courageous, confident, and more likely to want to go out to have fun. That’s when things happen—when you leave the house. Mars will enhance your attractiveness and charm, too. You’ve not seen him in your love sector (fifth house) in two years! Mars will remain there until April 30, so make the most of this lovely trend.</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>The new moon solar eclipse on April 8 is likely to stir up plenty of activity at work. A subordinate may leave, causing you to temporarily scramble, but this eclipse will act in your favor. If a colleague who reports to you departs, you will locate someone who is better suited for the job. Of course, seeing a team member or subordinate go is hard because it adds more weight onto your shoulders. You will have to train this new person, and the time it will take may exasperate you. Alternatively, it might not be someone in your office who moves on—it may be a person you depend on at home, such as a nanny or housekeeper.</p>
<p>The April 8 eclipse may change the type of computers you work on, the software you use, or your actual workplace, should you hear your office will be moving. A VIP might announce a departure (be “eclipsed out”), or management may disclose some changes you had not anticipated. You need not be tense about money—next month Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, is, for the first time in 12 years, moving into your financial eighth house.</p>
<p>In the meantime, keep in mind that you now have Jupiter in your seventh house of collaborators, partners, and marriage, so you will progress faster when working with an associate or middleman, such as a recruiter, lawyer, or any other professional on a confidential, one-to-one basis. If you are married, you will also share in your spouse’s gains.</p>
<p>April is complicated by Mercury retrograde in your work sector (sixth house) during most of the month, from April 1 to April 25. If you can hold off hiring a replacement until May, that would be ideal timing.</p>

        <p>Your chart does show some glittering spots for love thanks to your ruler Mars, which is now in highly compatible Pisces and will be rapidly increasing your chances for enjoying romance. If you are single and looking for your truelove, this is the very best place for Mars to be. You would first need to move beyond the conjunction of Mars and Saturn on April 10. (Saturn will be acting like a wet blanket on that day, and you might feel this during the first 10 days of April as this aspect builds.)</p>
<p>A gorgeous, romantic evening would be April 3, when Venus will conjoin Neptune and spin a bewitching evening of magical glamour. This is a weekday, but see if you can take full advantage of it by going out on a first date for dinner, or plan to meet your one-and-only in a bistro you’ve been wanting to try.</p>
<p>One of your very best days for fun and love will be April 19 when your ruler Mars sends a sparkly beam to good-fortune Jupiter. Alternatively, you can use this day to form a collaboration or partnership at work.</p>
<p>The very next day, April 20, good-fortune Jupiter will conjoin with Uranus, the planet of surprise, and possibly bring a sudden and unexpected proposal for marriage. Alternatively, you may decide on the perfect partner or agent in business (act on this in May). This could turn out to be one of the best days of the year, so keep your eye on it. A day this special won’t be repeated until September 2037, but this one has a large area of mathematical significance, showering the entire month with a certain glow.</p>

        <p>The full moon this month will be in Scorpio on April 23, and it could help you to clarify what you need to be happy. You will be so focused on others all month that this full moon will give you time to think about your own needs. This full moon is not without some ripples—Pluto, your other ruling planet, now in Aquarius, will be in hard angle to the Sun in Taurus and the full moon in Scorpio. Pluto will be stirring the pot in your home sector during the April 23 full moon, so you may learn you have to move house, possibly to live closer to your job or family or because the landlord wants to change the building from rentals to condominiums.</p>
<p>Instead of a move, this full moon might bring about a disagreement with an individual you have hired, such as a contractor or designer. Someone connected to your home (or even a family member) might act in a domineering and forceful way, making you feel like you’ve reached an impasse with this person—until you think of a creative answer you can use to break the logjam. This full moon will affect readers born onOctober 26, minus two days or plus five days, or those with Scorpio rising at 4 degrees, plus five or minus two degrees.</p>
<p>Pluto has recently settled in Aquarius, so a third way this might turn out is that you may have problems with electricity or electronics. If you hear a storm is coming, backup your computer and make sure all of your devices are fully charged before it arrives. At least you would be able to continue to communicate if the power goes out.</p>
<p>May is going to be a glorious, happy month, one of my favorites of the year.</p>
