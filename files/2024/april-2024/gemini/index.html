        <p>April will bring a lot of news, and most of it will be joyful. I say this even though your ruler Mercury will be retrograde nearly all month, from April 1 to April 25, but positive, rare signals between certain planets are so big and important this month that it makes me wonder if you will notice or even be ruffled by the little annoyances of Mercury retrograde.</p>
<p>The first big moment of the month will be on April 8 when the total eclipse of the Sun in Aries arrives at 19 degrees. This is a new moon on steroids, and new moons open fresh opportunities and situations. As a Gemini, you are an air sign, and as you start April, there will be a buildup of planets in fire-sign Aries—your ruler Mercury, Venus, the new moon, and the Sun—and all are compatible with Gemini, your Sun sign. Pluto is currently in air-sign Aquarius (also a supportive air sign for you, Gemini), and at this eclipse, Mars (in Pisces will be in direct conversation with Jupiter in Taurus).</p>
<p>With so much activity in Aries, your social eleventh house, there is no doubt that you will be mixing and mingling with many people this month. You may be invited to an important party, either within two days before the eclipse on April 8 or within five days after it appears.</p>
<p>(Note: 10% of Gemini may have felt the eclipse of April 8 a month earlier on March 8, and an additional 15% might feel it one month to the day later, on May 8, with the same tolerance of two days before and five days after. Most readers (75%) will feel the eclipse this month on April 8.)</p>

        <p>Socializing will become a busy, happy experience. The people you meet will be self-made, entrepreneurial types who will be stimulating to talk with, and they will energize you to pursue your goals, too. This gathering you attend might be a party, seminar, convention, club event, charity fundraiser, lecture, book signing, a class or weekend workshop, or some other type of event. Your chart suggests that rubbing elbows with many others will also help you further your career.</p>
<p>Any time people gather for a mutual purpose, it is a group, so it is ruled by the eleventh house. Groups are where all the golden nuggets lie for you this month. This is a new moon, so this trend will continue for many months, but it will be strongest now. I would like you to mix and mingle as much as possible in April and also to reconnect with friends and colleagues that you know from your past but have not reached out to recently. Be open to forming new friendships too, and if you should come across someone who is interesting, I suggest you meet for lunch and agree to a date.</p>
<p>All Gemini should see benefits accrue from this eclipse, and those with birthdays that fall within five days of June 9 will be especially favored. The same is true if you have Gemini rising, 19 degrees (plus or minus five degrees). If you have a natal planet or natal moon within four degrees of 19 degrees (before or after), this eclipse will send you gifts as well.</p>
<blockquote><p>Your career will be boosted by favorable forces bubbling up behind the scenes. Your talents, skill set, and recent fine performance have come to the attention of influential professionals.</p></blockquote>

        <p>If you do not have your horoscope, you can complete one for free on my website where it says, “Free Natal Birth Chart.” If you know your time of birth to the minute, choose the Placidus Tropical algorithm from the pull-down menu. If you don’t know your exact time of birth, you can still find out where your planets were on the day of your birth. Unlike other free charts online, I clearly give you your degrees. In your case, choose Solar Chart and Whole Sign from the pull-down menu.</p>
<p>Mars will take the lead at this eclipse, and Mars entered Pisces on March 22, to remain there until April 30. Mars will brilliantly light your tenth house of career honors, awards, and achievements, so you can make quite a bit of professional progress this month.</p>
<p>Best of all, at the time of this eclipse—and separate from it—Mars will align with Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck. This is fantastic. When it comes to your career, you can do no wrong. Apparently, VIPs adore your work, and subordinates compete with each other to have a chance to work for you—they know they can learn from you. You also have a reputation for being a kind and caring boss and for being clear and easy to understand when giving directives.</p>
<p>Saturn is traveling closely with Mars this month, and they make an unusual, untraditional alliance. Mars is always in a hurry to get things moving, but Saturn is just the opposite in nature. Saturn, a more cautious planet, will veto Mars’ haste, and say, “Not so fast, Mars.” Proceeding slowly is a good idea in April, not only because Saturn is holding Mars back, but also because Mercury will be retrograde from April 1 to April 25.</p>

        <p>During Mercury retrograde, everyone (no matter what zodiac sign) has to be more careful and deliberate in their actions because their judgment is often off. We become distracted, forgetful, and prone to quick, but unresearched, decisions that we regret later. Everyone is liable to fall into these traps, but Gemini and Virgo are a little more so because both signs are ruled by Mercury.</p>
<p>Here’s an interesting twist that’s taking place at the same time as the total eclipse of April 8 but is separate from it. Both Mars and Saturn will receive golden beams from Jupiter, the good fortune planet, and also at the same time, from Uranus, the planet of surprise.</p>
<p>This suggests your name is being favorably discussed in meetings behind closed doors and that soon after April 8, you may be given an offer for a project or a position (or one at another company) that could be quite distinguished and have great room for growth. (Mars’ closeness to Saturn strongly suggests that this job would be a weighty one.) With Uranus involved, you will be quite surprised when you receive the phone call or email.</p>
<p>Let’s now turn to another stunning aspect that will bring you good news.</p>
<p>On Saturday, April 20, Jupiter, the great benefic planet, will make its exact alignment with Uranus, the planet of surprise. This is an aspect of great joy, optimism, and unexpected breakthroughs. This will only happen once this year, on April 20, and these planets will meet in Taurus. This aspect is so rare that it won’t happen again for 13 years, not until September 2037, when then they will meet in Cancer. Rare aspects like this one are usually quite noticeable when they occur.</p>

        <p>You will certainly feel this a day or two before, on Thursday, April 18, and Friday, April 19, or over the weekend of April 20 and April 21. You may even feel it on Monday, April 22. Both Jupiter and Uranus will be meeting, as said, in Taurus, and this will be in the most hidden part of your solar chart, your twelfth house. This again suggests that something wonderful is bubbling up about you behind closed doors, under your radar.</p>
<p>Your twelfth house is not only about the confidential matters taking place that you don’t know about, it’s also the place where you can create a future strategy, which you may be involved with now. Additionally, when your twelfth house is beautifully aspected (as it is this month), it gives fantastic benefits to you if you are working on a project that requires a great deal of concentration and research done alone, in solitude.</p>
<p>Your hidden most twelfth house is also the house of healing. If you have a medical screening or procedure that you wish you didn’t have to do but know it’s in your best interest to complete, I suggest you choose a time near April 20 to take care of it. If you have an emergency, of course, take care of it when you can. Get it done.</p>
<p>If you find that more steps to protect your health will be necessary, you might be thrilled to learn that May will be a fantastic month—it will be insanely wonderful. May will be the best month of the year for you to work on wellness matters. This includes not only having little screenings done but also visiting a therapist to discuss a problem that has been on your mind or checking into rehab to receive help with any dependency you may be suffering from.</p>
<p>Speaking of your health, the April 23 full moon (not an eclipse) in Scorpio might highlight your well-being on or near the day it appears.</p>

        <p>Let me be clear, this full moon might not emphasize your health—it will light your sixth house, which rules the preventative measures you take to stay healthy. Your sixth house also governs your work-a-day projects that often come across your desk, the people you work with, and the tools you use and the places you go to accomplish your professional tasks. One or the other area (health or work) is likely to be lit, but it’s possible, although less likely, that both areas could be active. The April 23 full moon is not an eclipse, so it’s not as powerful as the April 8 new moon total eclipse of the Sun.</p>
<p>At this full moon, Pluto in Aquarius will be in hard angle to the Sun in Taurus and the full moon in Scorpio. You may feel pressure because these are fixed signs that don’t blend well and are often known to be averse to compromise. You might have a deadline to meet from your publisher, or if you work in broadcasting, your bureau chief will press on you. You will have a story that must be finished and ready to air.</p>
<p>Pluto is now in your ninth house, which rules the media. The ninth house also governs foreign people, international trade, and global relationships. Additionally, the ninth house, mainly an intellectual house, rules college and graduate school as well as distant, foreign travel, which the ancient astrologers felt was an alternate form of education and learning. (I think we all agree.) One of these areas will be a focus and source of some stress until you get at least three days beyond the high point of the full moon on April 23. It looks like you are under a deadline to complete a major project at this time.</p>
<p>While Pluto might be throwing his weight around, you do have one sterling aspect at the full moon on April 23—Jupiter (luck and happiness) and Uranus (unexpected developments) are both in perfect angle to Mars. Ironically, a Scorpio full moon will put emphasis on Pluto AND Mars—and one planet (Pluto) is causing tension, while the other (Mars) is offering happy news in the eleventh hour. (One reader asked me what does “the eleventh hour” mean? It means at the last minute.)</p>

        <p>Keep in mind that your first house rules your health and vitality (not affected here), and your sixth house rules the proactive steps you take to stay healthy (medical tests, screenings, X-rays, CAT scans, MRIs, and so forth). Your first house will not be affected by this full moon. Your eighth house rules surgery, so this house is not affected here either. To be sure, you should check your forecast for your rising sign, too. Both medical and dental procedures are covered by your sixth house, so you may need dental care.</p>
<p>If it is not your health that is accentuated at this full moon, then it will be a project that is coming to fullness within days of April 23. You may need to hire someone to help you finish all of your work. If so, make a temporary hire for now because of Mercury retrograde. (Don’t buy anything expensive, like a car or computer—nothing electronic—and try not to sign any agreements until your glorious month of May.)</p>
<p>One day that should be simply wonderful for your career will come early—April 3—when Venus and Neptune will align in Pisces. You may be on TV or appear in print media with your photo because Neptune rules the silver image, and with Venus there too, you will love the picture they use.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Several planets will have moved into Aries and be settled in your friendship sector, and included among them will be the Sun and new moon solar eclipse on April 8. New moon eclipses are known to bring news, change, and opportunity, although at times, an eclipse might also remove a person or situation from your immediate surroundings to make room for new conditions. This may happen if a close friend gets married or moves to a different region, and you will sense that you can’t be friends in the way you were, but you can stay in touch. Eclipses push us forward, and this one on April 8 will pour new and exciting people into your life.</p>

        <p>Nevertheless, it appears that a friend, colleague, or person you know from a club, political organization, charity, or community action association you belong to will trigger news near April 8. You may hear that your talents could be put to excellent use, so it might be an offer to take on a leadership role that is too good to pass up. You may meet new people at a party, seminar, lecture, class you take, or convention. You will be noticed, and you could find an opportunity to advance your career. Still, you will have to be patient because Mercury is retrograde (April 1-25) and Mars is orbiting near Saturn, which will also slow your progress.</p>
<p>This eclipse will emphasize Mars as the predominant planet, and Mars, as said, is orbiting close to Saturn, which is in your tenth house of prestigious career advancement all month. Expect for the work you do to take a little longer than usual to complete, possibly because getting a consensus from higher-ups will be difficult—some may be missing in action (potentially away on business trips) or else completely indecisive. Mars will want you to move quickly, but Saturn, with his yellow blinking light, will urge you to think everything through more thoroughly. As you see, you will need to carefully review your projects before you take action.</p>
<p>Also, put off signing papers in April because your ruler Mercury, as said, will be retrograde from April 1 to April 25. Mercury in this mode will bring a number of cancellations, postponements, and redesigns. Don’t start anything new just yet—this can feel frustrating, but later you will be glad you waited. Look closer at your blueprints, and use the time to question any assumptions.</p>
<p>Your career will be boosted by favorable forces bubbling up behind the scenes. Your talents, skill set, and recent fine performance have come to the attention of influential people. It seems someone is considering giving you a bigger professional role in the company you work for or at another company, or to partner with you by hiring you to join an important new venture. You will receive a hint of this on April 19 and April 20 and the days surrounding these dates (which fall over a weekend).</p>

        <p>It seems you will be unaware that VIPs in your industry (who you may not know or have ever met) have been so impressed with you that an offer to take on more responsibility may come out of the blue. Study thisproposal carefully as you will be accepting a weighty job—announce your answer in early May. This news will be exciting, but see if you can deliberately slow down before you make your decision, and enlist the help of your lawyer if you are given a contract to sign (likely). If you have previously worked with the people whoapproach you, you can easily agree and sign in April—you started this relationship a long time ago, not now with Mercury retrograde.</p>
<p>The full moon of April 23 could see the completion of an important project, which may have allowed you room to add stylish, imaginative touches to it.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on your health as you will have to give this project a burst of energy near that time, and you will be expected to ship it out. Still, this may not be easy because you might have had a number of last-minute corrections and will have to do some problem-solving on the fly. You may have less than the usual number of staff on hand too, so it will be up to you to pick up the slack. This effort could take a lot out of you, so ideally, you will be able to rest afterward.</p>
<p>You might want to take a short, three-day holiday to enjoy the emerging season over April 28-30. If the resort you visit has a spa, by all means, indulge. You’ll need to rest and recharge. May will be a far more productive and even glamourous month, and you will see the reason why you were wise not to push forward quickly in April—the timing is simply off. By the time you get to May, the delays of April will melt before your eyes and be replaced with dozens of dazzling days, each one better than the next.</p>
