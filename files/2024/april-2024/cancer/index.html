        <p>Life is about to become exciting, especially because migrating planets have entered Aries and are filling your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement. Those celestial bodies are Venus, Mercury, the Sun, and the new moon solar eclipse in Aries, 19 degrees, on April 8. This new moon arrives as a total eclipse of the Sun, which is a very powerful new moon, meant to open up new options and opportunities. It will affect you where the eclipse appears, which is in your prestigious career sector.</p>
<p>New moons have a long tail and can affect you for months, so your career appears poised to take a giant step forward, and this is not a fluke or temporary situation. It’s the start of all good things, including admiration and applause for your work well done. This is a trend that will last.</p>
<p>Indeed, your career will be on fire this month, and even if you think there is no way you will be promoted, given a new title, suddenly read a story about yourself in the press, or even be tapped by another firm for an exciting high-level job—just wait. Rarely have I seen such activity in your career house, so good things appear ready to spring into being.</p>
<p>Although these events will happen fast, you will need to slow things down as best you can. Mercury will be retrograde from April 1 to April 25, and Mars, the action planet, will be orbiting with Saturn all month, which will bring a need for caution and research before you jump into anything new. You CAN move swiftly in your best month of the year—May, next month—but for now, make sure you understand all facets of the role you may be taking on.</p>

        <p>Eclipses arrive in pairs, as a full moon and new moon. The first one of the pair arrived on March 25, and appeared as a full moon lunar eclipse in Libra. It accented a family member and likely concerned a parent, child, or other family member you are close to and care about. You may be moved to help this family member with your time or money or by making an important decision on their behalf.</p>
<p>As a Cancer, the moon is your ruler, so you feel lunar eclipses more than solar eclipses. Last month’s March 25 eclipse could have been an emotional, stressful time for you. The good thing about a full moon eclipse is that it delivers news and may show you misguided thinking or flaws in a situation. Once you make a decision, the episode is over, and tension drains away.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may have needed an important repair or plumbing job for your house or apartment, or perhaps you finished a massive paint job of your home, renovated certain rooms, moved into a new space, had furniture delivered, or saw a change in who you live with when a roommate moved out or moved in. You may have rented a new apartment or summer cottage or closed on a house you purchased. There are many possibilities, and these are just examples of what may have come up.</p>

        <p>Your attention switches from your home and family to your career status with the new moon solar eclipse on April 8. During a total eclipse of the Sun, often one top person, most likely a male VIP, will be “eclipsed out” of his high-level role, and this could happen at the company where you work. His departure will be a change that could very possibly create an opportunity for you. (I say the departing VIP is a male because the Sun denotes males in positions of authority.)</p>
<p>Pluto in your financial solar eighth house will signal Venus, currently in Aries and your prestigious tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement. This is likely to translate into more money for you, most likely in the form of a commission, bonus, cash advance, or better company benefits (which, if you had to buy them yourself, would be costly).</p>
<p>The bigger change appears to be regarding your job title and influence in the company. In some ways, the previous eclipse in Aries, which occurred last year on April 19, 2023, is tied in theme to this month’s new moon solar eclipse on April 8. Think back to see if you can find a common theme.</p>
<p>You also have a lot of activity in your ninth house of international travel and global trade and relationships, and you may be traveling to a different country for work. If you cannot travel, then you will be on the phone and emailing a great deal with company headquarters or a client based in another country.</p>

        <p>Mars is traveling with Saturn, so the role that your higher-ups have in mind for you is a weighty one. Additionally, Mars will signal Jupiter, who is traveling in your eleventh house of hopes and wishes—a fabulous and rare aspect that usually brings great progress. Mars will also contact Uranus in the same eleventh house, so you will be very surprised when the offer comes either on or within days of April 8. If management does not give you a promotion, it looks like the industry will be putting you in the position of spokesperson or pundit concerning industry trends.</p>
<p>Venus and Neptune are traveling close together in Pisces, a glamourous vibration, and on April 3 they make an exact alignment. At some point in the first two weeks of April, you may need to have your professional photo taken, perhaps to go along with a press release that will be integral to a news story written about you. Take your photo on April 3 when the moon will not be void-of-course.

<p>Now let’s talk about a hugely important and highly beneficial aspect of the month, the alignment of Jupiter, giver of gifts and luck, and Uranus, planet of surprise and all unanticipated events, meeting in your friendship and social group sector on Saturday, April 20, to be felt the day prior, April 19, and possibly as late as Monday, April 22.</p>
<p>This is an exceedingly rare aspect that will only happen once this year, on April 20. Jupiter and Uranus will conjoin in Taurus and not meet again until September 2037, 13 years from now. Rare aspects are always more noticeable—they bring a fresh, new experience. This is happening in your eleventh house of social groups and friendships, so a dear friend may help you, and in so doing, your friend’s gesture may touch your heart. You will be quite surprised.</p>

        <p>This same house is a very special place in your chart because, in addition to ruling your friends and social groups, it rules pure joy as well as your deepest hopes and wishes. If you have a burning desire to grasp a dream or a wish but have been stymied until now, it may materialize on or near April 20.</p>
<p>I cannot overstate how important and beneficial this aspect on April 20 will likely be for you. Use this date and the dates surrounding it to aim for something that is hard to do and where you wish to have an edge or special advantage from the universe. Schedule an interview, send a letter, submit an application, have a first meeting, make a bid on a house—you get the idea. This is a special time of the year.</p>
<p>Your romantic life will draw your attention on April 23 during the full moon in Scorpio, 4 degrees. Your fifth house will be lit up, which also rules your children (although the emphasis of the fifth house is on your first child). You appear to be coming to a decision about how best to help a child, and it may mark the end of a long period of thinking. Alternatively, a creative project may be racing toward a finish, as both artistic endeavors and children (and possibly a love relationship) are all ruled by the fifth house. If you don’t have a child or creative endeavor, you may be making a decision about someone you are dating, deciding whether to continue and take the next step or to leave.</p>
<p>This full moon (not an eclipse) on April 23 won’t be entirely easy because the ruler of Scorpio, Pluto, will be in Aquarius and in tight, hard 90-degree angle to both the Sun in Taurus and the full moon in Scorpio. All three signs are fixed signs that don’t bend easily. Money (or the lack of it) seems to play a key role in the story of this full moon.</p>

        <p>Technically, a full moon in Scorpio blends well with Cancer, and if you were born within four days of June 24, that will help. The same is true if you have Scorpio rising 4 degrees (plus or minus four degrees), or your natal moon or a natal planet in Cancer, Pisces, Virgo, or Capricorn at 4 degrees, plus or minus four degrees. The jury is still out about how people with natal planets in Scorpio or Taurus will do, especially considering the position of Pluto. We’ll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Still, Mars, who also rules Scorpio (the sign of the full moon), will be watching the antics of Scorpio’s other ruler Pluto, and will do all he can to quickly contact benefic Jupiter and surprise-a-minute Uranus in Taurus for you. Both Jupiter and Uranus are in your friendship sector, so a friend may step forward with an idea, a tip, a reference, or an introduction that helps you at this full moon, most likely at the last minute.</p>
<p>Energetic Mars is in talks with Saturn, to be in exact alignment on April 10 and already within orb two days earlier on the April 8 eclipse. Mars wants to speed up, but slow and steady Saturn will hold Mars back so that you’ll think before you act.</p>
<p>Additionally, both these planets in Pisces will send greetings to Jupiter, a rare aspect. This suggests that you may have to readjust the structure of a financial situation, possibly involving a creative project or the needs of a child. You should be able to do so because Jupiter and Saturn are within the realm of a very friendly aspect.</p>

        <p>Mercury will be retrograde from April 1 to April 25, but some of the aspects this month are so special, I doubt you will be flustered by the delays and little setbacks of Mercury. The eclipse of April 8 is so good for your career and your overall reputation that I cannot imagine you will notice the little things happening on the sidelines.</p>
<p>April will be a gorgeous month, and certainly one of the very best of the entire year. It will be a big month, full of lucky breaks and help from friends and new people who come into your life. Be excited—I am excited for you!</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Get ready for dramatic, gratifying changes in your professional status at work, for a new moon solar eclipse in Aries on April 8 will appear in your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement. If you assumed no one noticed or appreciated your excellent performance in recent months, you’ll soon see that VIPs have been impressed with what you’ve been doing for quite some time. You are soon to be rewarded.</p>
<p>This month could bring a long-awaited promotion or another month of praise and reward. While this news is breaking, you may learn a top person at the helm will announce his departure, creating a fluid hierarchy which may now benefit you. Your new role will be strongly entrepreneurial, and so it follows that new concepts and bold ideas will be welcomed and applauded. Saturn’s proximity to Mars suggests your new position will bring weighty responsibility as well as power and influence.</p>

        <p>If you don’t get a promotion, or if you are self-employed, you will bring in a new, prestigious international client that will have the industry talking about you. Alternatively, someone may reach out to you through a club or social group and turn you into a spokesperson for the entire industry. You may find yourself quoted in the press this month—get used to this, shy Cancer, as this is only the beginning.</p>
<p>One way or another it looks like you will take a distant trip this month. If the organization you work for is based in a foreign country, you may travel to the company headquarters to meet with the powers at the top. If so, you may be pleasantly surprised and flattered to hear about the new role management has planned for you. To ease into this new position, you may need a period of adjustment or orientation in the coming weeks, but things should begin rolling quickly next month, in May.</p>
<p>Delays are inevitable this month because Mercury will be retrograde in Aries in your career tenth house from April 1 to April 25. Mars, the ruler of that same prestigious career house, will be orbiting with Saturn, underscoring the same need to slow down.</p>
<p>This is not the time to initiate a new program, product, or project. Instead, do your research. Find out which actions in the company’s history succeeded, which ones did not, and why. This will be superb for information-gathering, and co-workers and managers will want to share their stories with you.</p>

        <p>The compensation being offered you will be generous—don’t be shy about asking for the salary you feel you should be paid. In so many ways, this month will be a big boost to your morale and self-confidence. New and old friends and allies will have a large part to play in your career development, too—you will see this theme in action now, and even more so next month.</p>
<p>Your personal emotional life seems to suffer under the weight of all the career news swirling about you. Someone might feel left out or neglected—it could be your steady sweetheart, if dating seriously, or instead, one of your children, who will want and need more attention from you. This will become apparent at the full moon in Scorpio in your fifth house on April 23.</p>
<p>As a Cancer, you will likely sense what is going on and attend to this because others’ feelings are important to you. You are coming to a conclusion about something, and this seems to be a temporary condition that is easy to ameliorate. A concern for a child may be on your mind—perhaps she needs special lessons, but the harshness of Pluto suggests you may also be worried about how much all this will cost.</p>
<p>If you’re married, your spouse is revealed in a different part of your chart, the seventh house, so your spouse appears happy to see your dreams take flight. If anyone can smooth things over, it’s Cancer—stay confident.</p>
<p>Just when you might assume all is lost, Mars will reach out to Jupiter and Uranus, and you may get help at the last moment. This tells me you should keep looking for solutions because your efforts to do so will be rewarded.</p>
