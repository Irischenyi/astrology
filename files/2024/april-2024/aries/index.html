        <p>It’s birthday time for you, and I am here to convince you that although Mercury will be retrograde from April 1 to April 25, there is room for this to be a glorious month. I love some of the aspects coming your way in April, and I will show you them in my report. Sometimes we have aspects so big that they overshadow the pesky little ones like Mercury retrograde. This looks to be one of those good months.</p>
<p>You have just come through a lunar eclipse on March 25 in Libra 5 degrees. The bigger, more important one, arriving as a solar new moon eclipse, is coming this month in Aries, 19 degrees, on April 8.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about the one that just occurred on March 25 in Libra, falling in your partnership/marriage house. This sector also rules serious collaborators and important clients and sponsors. Something was coming to fullness on that eclipse, because a full moon lunar eclipse brings closure, completion, or sometimes an end. It was time to decide about a collaboration or romantic alliance based on news coming in near that time.</p>
<p>That eclipse fell close to the start of Mercury retrograde in Aries, so if you experienced any difficulties, it would have come from a lack of clear communication. That eclipse seemed mild, however, so if you were challenged—and you value the relationship—it seems you can find a solution. Many Aries may have found that eclipse easy and decided to move in with their sweetheart, become engaged, or wed. Other Aries may have hired an agent or new accountant or taken other steps to collaborate with an expert.</p>

        <p>If you are not married, do not have a serious, long-term romantic attachment, or do not collaborate with other experts, such as sponsors, an agent, or publicist that you work closely with on a nearly daily basis, or have a partnership at work, then you would not have noticed the effects of the March 25 eclipse in Libra.</p>
<p>To restate this astrologically, if you have no planets in early degrees of Libra, Aries, Cancer, or Capricorn, you will not have felt the effects of this eclipse directly. You would need a planet in Libra, Aries, Capricorn, or Cancer in your natal chart between 0 to 10 degrees for you to have been aware of that eclipse.</p>
<p>If you know your time of birth, you can print out you birth chart for free on my website. Go to the homepage of AstrologyZone.com and click on “Free Natal Birth Chart.” Unlike other free charts from other sites online, I give you all the degrees of your natal planets plus an interpretation that I wrote of the planets in your individual chart. (You can only download your chart on my Internet site, not on my app, “Astrology Zone Horoscopes.”)</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the star moments of the month arrives on April 8, the new moon solar eclipse in Aries, where I see more money coming to you.</p></blockquote>

        <p>When you run your chart, choose the “Placidus Tropical” algorithm from the pull-down menu. If you don’t know your time of birth, you can do a chart anyway, and in that case choose “Sunrise” as your time of birth (the correct default) and “Whole House” system instead. You won’t learn your rising sign, but you will discover where the planets were positioned on the day you were born. If you find any natal planet in one of the cardinal signs listed above (Aries, Libra, Cancer, or Capricorn) within that range of 0 to 10 degrees, that planet will light up—note what house it is in, in your chart.</p>
<p>One of the star moments of the month arrives on April 8, the new moon solar eclipse in Aries, 19 degrees. New moons open new opportunities and fresh starts, so I am enthusiastic about this total eclipse of the Sun. Mars, your ruling planet, will be beautifully conversant with Jupiter (good fortune) and Uranus (sudden surprise), and both are in your solar second house, a financial sector that rules your earned income. I see more money coming to you due to the eclipse of April 8. The money may arrive immediately or later, but within weeks, depending on what happens.</p>
<p>Most people (75%) feel an eclipse when it happens (or within five days), and others (10%) feel it a month to the day before it happens—March 8—or (15%) a month to the day after it happens—May 8. Again, add the plus or minus five days tolerance.</p>
<p>Eclipse messages are very dramatic and clear, so you won’t have to wonder if you received a message or not—you will know. Sometimes you have to give up something at eclipse time to get something new. I call it giving a sacrificial lamb to the eclipse. The universe does not tolerate the vacuum left behind, so it will rush to fill it fairly quickly.</p>

        <p>This April 8 eclipse is going to be visible mainly in the United States, so you will notice quite a stir in the media about it, at least in the US. (It is rare to have one so perfectly visible in the US, and although eclipses are seen everywhere on Earth, they tend to occur more in the Southern Hemisphere.)</p>
<p>There are numerous sites where you can find out more about the eclipse, but I feel one of the best is by NASA located here: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yspyt978">https://tinyurl.com/yspyt978</a>. You will see the path the eclipse will take with a chart giving you the exact time the eclipse will occur in each city along its path.</p>
<p>Keep in mind if you have bad weather and a heavy cloud cover, you won’t see much. (Alas, I live in New York City, and we have a cloud cover nearly every day. New Yorkers will only see about 90% totality of the eclipse, not 100% such as Dallas, Texas, or Buffalo, New York, will see.)</p>
<p>Some astrologers feel if the eclipse path goes over where you’re located, you will feel it more, but I do not agree. What’s important is whether the degree of the eclipse touches the degrees of one or more of your natal planets, Sun, or moon. If so, you will be affected by the eclipse, and it doesn’t matter if you are in the eclipse’s path of totality or not.</p>

        <p>This eclipse will make this a new moon on steroids, which I feel will open up all sorts of positive possibilities for you. You may be getting a project or job that is in a new area in which few people have any knowledge or expertise. There will be plenty to learn, which could be exciting for you. The new work may involve a new branch of technology or scientific research. Alternatively, this eclipse could mark the time you are getting ready to open your own business, or if you are self-employed, to place a new product on the market.</p>
<p>Let’s look at more detail. The planets are traveling closely together in the first part of 2024, and this month is no exception—you have Venus, Mercury, the Sun, and new moon all in Aries, filling your first house of determination, vitality, personality, and personal desire. I love that every planet in your solar chart is on the eastern side of your chart, suggesting that you have full control of what happens next—in other words, you are steering the ship. You won’t need an agent or middleman to help you bring opportunities, as you will be able to generate them on your own—this is remarkably favorable.</p>
<p>Neptune is still in Pisces at the time of the eclipse, but only two tiny degrees away from being in Aries. Neptune will officially enter your sign next year, however, many astrologers—myself included—feel once a planet is within three degrees of the next sign, it is already influencing that new sign, in this case Aries.</p>
<p>Neptune will be giving us a little preview of what is to come once it is in Aries by stepping back and forth from Pisces to Aries and back again. Neptune will settle permanently in Aries on January 26, 2026. This influence is new—Neptune has not been in Aries since 1861 to 1875. Even now Neptune is close enough to Aries (two degrees) to get a sense of him in this new sign.</p>
<p>Readers born early in Aries (March 20 to March 22) need to be sure they have all the facts before entering into a new agreement or venture because Neptune can create an illusion that looks very real but is more likely only to be wishful thinking. On the other hand, Neptune can make a person exceptionally creative, especially in the arts.</p>

        <p>At the time of the April 8 new moon solar eclipse, Pluto will reach out to Venus in a positive way and will also signal Neptune to provide support from Pluto’s position in your friendship sector (eleventh house). This suggests your influential friends will be willing to introduce or recommend you to high-level people who may be able to further your career. Pluto’s interactions with Venus are known to be passionate, so that could help your love life.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mars, your ruler, will be orbiting close to Saturn all month. Mars’ nature is to rush forward with courage, but at eclipse time (especially with Mercury retrograde), it’s usually not wise to move too fast. Cautious Saturn will gently hold Mars back and give you the time to do careful due diligence concerning the new venture you may want to enter. You will need to study all facets of the job you would be expected to do before you jump in with both feet.</p>
<p>The very best aspect at the eclipse involves Mars with a direct beam to Jupiter, the good fortune planet, in your second house of earned income. In this aspect, preparation plus action leads to substantial profit. Mars and Jupiter will be in within a significant six-degree orb on April 8.</p>
<p>Mars will move into an exact, breathtaking alignment with Jupiter on April 19. I cannot overstate how fortunate this aspect will be for you and its influence on the outcome of the eclipse. (Later I will tell you about another sensational aspect happening April 20 that you can feel on April 19, too—not to be confused with the sterling Mars-Jupiter connection I just mentioned!)</p>

        <p>Now let’s discuss the full moon (not an eclipse) in Scorpio at 4 degrees on April 23 when a financial matter will be concluded within five days of this date. This full moon will energize your eighth house of other people’s money. You might file and pay your taxes (or get a refund), send a payment to your credit card company, or reduce a bank or student loan. It looks like money will go out, but it’s very possible money will come in, too.</p>
<p>Pluto in Aquarius will be in tight, hard angle to both the Sun in Taurus and the full moon in Scorpio on April 23, so you may feel tension—someone may be pressuring you to pay on time. Jupiter in your second house of earned income and savings will still be in supportive angle to Mars like he was on April 8.</p>
<p>I feel you will likely find the money to pay off a pressing obligation, but you may feel frustrated that you have to pay for something that doesn’t give you much pleasure. You might be paying your dentist for a root canal or other procedure that your insurance does not fully cover. Alternatively, you may have to buy something for your home, such as a water heater, or maybe your car needs a new battery, both of which are necessary but not much fun to buy. You can probably think of a hundred things you would rather put that money toward. Well, we all have this kind of situation from time to time. I am glad you have help from Mars and Jupiter.</p>
<p>Now for that good news I mentioned before! A very special aspect will occur that will affect you for two days—April 19 and April 20—namely, Jupiter conjunct Uranus. When these two planets meet, they are meant to bring hope and happiness to each of us. Think about this: The planet of good fortune (Jupiter) is set to conjoin the planet of surprise (Uranus) in Taurus and light your house of earned income.</p>
<p>This is a joyous aspect that will ONLY HAPPEN ONCE. Aspects like this that are rarely seen are usually felt strongly when they do come by. The next time Jupiter and Uranus will conjoin will be in September 2037, 13 years from now, and they’ll be in Cancer, so the effect will be different.</p>

        <p>For now, thanks to the alignment of Jupiter, the planet of good fortune, and Uranus, the planet of surprise, it appears that a sum of money is on the way to you, and it’s apt to make you very happy. Best of all, the news will be completely unexpected.</p>
<p>You might get a raise or an offer for a high-level job that pays you much more than you are being paid now. If you are in college or graduate school, you may get news that you are being offered a scholarship or a generous financial-aid package. If you are a researcher, you may hear you are being approved for the grant you applied for earlier. You may be given a very generous amount of cash as a birthday gift from family that, together with your savings, will allow you to start a business, have a baby, or put a down payment on a house, as some examples.</p>
<p>It may, alternatively, work out that you will get an astounding bargain on an expensive item you want to buy—getting a price so attractive it is tantamount to buying wholesale. (Be careful, though as Mercury is retrograde, which can cause lack of judgment almost all month, from April 1 to April 25.)Traditionally, Mercury retrograde is never a good time to shop for pricey items and an especially a bad time to buy electronics or a car (which has a lot of electronic chips). You might make a big sale, such from real estate, or when you empty your closet of no-longer-needed clothing and sell them on an elegant Internet pre-owned commerce site.</p>
<p>There are other ways this could work out over April 19-20. Uranus, the planet of surprise, involved in this aspect, rules your eleventh house of friendships, and Jupiter rules your solar ninth house of travel, so it is possible this will set off a distant trip that you had not expected.</p>
<p>Now, here’s more good news: Mars will enter Aries for the first time in two years on April 30, giving you much more control over all events in your life—even more than you felt as you started the month with so many planets in Aries. Mars is for you just like the fuel that allows you to drive your car or cook your home-made soup on the stove. Most importantly, Mars is your ruling planet, and finally, he will be in the ideal position to help you.</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>As the month opens, Mercury will be retrograde in Aries from April 1 to 25, so the pace of life will slow down. At the same time, active Mars, which is your ruling planet, will orbit close to cautious Saturn, and will slow things down even more. Mars and Saturn will make an exact conjunction on April 10, but you will soon see that the entire month will require careful moves, making sure you have all the facts before moving forward. It appears things are happening behind the scenes that you have yet to hear about, so making a decision now would not be wise. Make it a point to avoid making assumptions too, and delay all actions until you get to one of your best months of the year—May.</p>
<p>Don’t rail against this lackadaisical tempo of April, as delays will benefit you, especially financially. You have been busy ever since the year started, so when your schedule inevitably opens up due to postponements, take it with a shrug and a smile. Be glad for the occasional, unexpected release of extra time you will get so you can follow your own agenda. At points this month you will be able to attend to other matters that you had put aside earlier.</p>
<p>Despite Mercury retrograde, this could still turn out to be a big month, one filled with good news, some of it even spectacular.</p>
<p>On April 8, a new moon total eclipse of the Sun will arrive in Aries. It will be friendly, and it will likely open an intriguing new opportunity for you. You may have to give up one situation or relationship to receive another, but doing so will likely bring an improvement. Along with the Sun and new moon in Aries, Venus is also in Aries, so you may refresh elements of your appearance and enjoy the compliments that come your way. The closer your birthday falls to the eclipse April 8 (within five days before or after), the more likely you will see changes.</p>

        <p>On April 19, Mars will have a wildly beneficial conversation with Jupiter, indicating that the careful actions you take on this day could lead to growth and profit. You will already start to sense this good aspect as early as April 8. You seem to be one of the favorites of the universe these days and in a position to reap a lot of goodies.</p>
<p>You are quite a money magnet, and you will be even more so the following day, April 20, when good-fortune Jupiter will align with Uranus, the planet of surprise. You are likely to get exciting financial news—suddenly and out of left field—and it looks like you will be thrilled.</p>
<p>This exciting aspect that will only happen once in 2024—now .</p>
<p>Since your finances are looking up, Friday, April 19, would also be an ideal day to ask for a raise. If you are self-employed, gently increase your fees to clients for your goods or services. This day is so rare and powerful that these two planets (Jupiter and Uranus) will not meet again until September 2037 (and by then in a different part of your chart). If April 20 is your birthday, or within four days prior of this date, you may get a generous cash gift or valuable piece of art or jewelry.</p>
<p>The full moon will fall a few days later in Scorpio on April 23. This full moon will light your eighth house of other people’s money, so if you are feeling flush with cash, you may send a significant check to the government to pay taxes, make a student or bank loan payment, or polish off a credit card debt. It does not seem you can avoid paying off this obligation (due to Pluto’s presence). Thankfully, your ruler Mars will come to the rescue by signaling both Jupiter and Uranus—and presto! It looks like you will be able to bring in more cash. A new, non-traditional idea or method (legal, of course) will work. It looks like you will be able to cover any debt and also save some money for yourself to do as you please.</p>
