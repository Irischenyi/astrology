        <p>As you enter April, a lot is happening behind closed doors, but you will soon find out what is going on. Planets are stacking up in the most private portion of your chart—your ruler Venus, Mercury, the Sun, and the new moon. The total eclipse of the Sun on April 8 will be in Aries and your twelfth house. An eclipse is known to bring a bright floodlight of truth to a situation, so you are likely to hear the details of a secret that has been under wraps for a while and that you were not privy to knowing.</p>
<p>Don’t assume all secrets bring bad news. Indeed, the secret (if there is one) could bring a happy surprise! You have been through a series of difficult eclipses since November 2021 in Taurus and your opposite of Scorpio, so it is understandable you would put your guard up when you hear the word “eclipse.” This new family of eclipses in Libra and Aries are milder in influence and less likely to uproot you like the previous family of eclipses in Taurus and Scorpio were prone to do.</p>
<p>Last month, on March 25, you had a penumbral full moon eclipse in Libra in your sixth house of daily work assignments and preventative measures you take to stay healthy. You may have seen a worker leave—someone you trusted and who reported to you—or you may have seen changes in your daily work flow. Alternatively, you may have heard of decisions management has made that might eventually affect you. Regarding your health, you may have had screenings at your doctor’s or dentist’s office that showed one or two items that you might want to follow up on.</p>
<p>Now, turning to the April 8 new moon total eclipse of the Sun in Aries, this eclipse will put an additional emphasis on health (possibly) because the twelfth house rules mental health—the subconscious—and the help we gain from coaches and therapists. The twelfth house is an area that rules confinement, so you might check yourself into a hospital for surgery you need or into a rehab center to heal. You might finally get your wisdom teeth out (if they have given you trouble) or have some physical therapy that might help you.</p>

        <p>I know none of these medical possibilities (as examples) sound like fun, but your heath is precious, and you need to protect it. Besides, the April 8 eclipse is a friendly one and is about providing fresh starts. PLUS you have Jupiter, the planet of good fortune, healing, and even miracles in Taurus, sent to you by a loving universe to protect you.</p>
<p>You will continue to have Jupiter in Taurus through most of May, until May 25 when Jupiter will move on to Gemini. My favorite aspect at the time of the April 8 eclipse is that Mars is in a friendly position to Jupiter (within just six degrees) and “applying,” meaning growing in influence.</p>
<p>On top of this, Mars is in your friendship-oriented eleventh house of hopes and wishes, so one of your friends may be very helpful to you this month in a way that touches you. Mars will remain in this area of your chart until April 30.</p>
<blockquote><p>You have a fantastic aspect coming up on April 20. A breakthrough on some level is near, and you will likely be so happy when you get the news.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Even more importantly, Mars and Jupiter will stay within significant warm and friendly orb all month, so your friends, and even casual acquaintances and contacts, will be blessings for you. Having a friendly Mars is even more important this month because Mars is taking the lead at the April 8 eclipse—it’s the dominant planet (Mars rules Aries). As you see, you have many happy experiences to look forward to in April.</p>
<p>Venus is your guardian planet and will be receiving superb vibrations from Pluto in your career sector, so that part of your life—your reputation and capacity for professional growth and leadership—is excellent.</p>
<p>As a sum-up, this April 8 eclipse, a new moon, will bring you a fresh opportunity. Each house of the horoscope covers a number of different possibilities, so you might see changes at work, such as being given new equipment or software to learn, or hear the company is moving to a new headquarters, or you may see a subordinate depart and soon a new one will be hired. You may see a large client leave or a new one come in.</p>
<p>For the April 8 eclipse, as I discussed earlier, instead, a secret (or something hidden about your life or your body) may come out. Eclipses bring opportunities and possibilities as well as offer new direction, and they’ll often require some sort of adjustment. Still, your new situation would be something you choose to take on (not forced to accept), and therefore I feel the new role would be one you would be willing to take the time to learn. Additionally, eclipses often look for weak links in your life and show them to you so that you can live a more productive, happier life.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the nature of eclipses, have a look at my article “How to Deal with Eclipses” that I wrote and that many readers say has been helpful to them. It’s on my Astrologyzone.com website, or you can google the title of the essay, and it will come up with my byline in my website.</p>

<p>Now, BIG news! You have a fantastic aspect coming up on April 20. Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck will be conjunct Uranus, the planet of surprise. These two planets are meeting in Taurus, 22 degrees. This is a fantastic aspect, which will only appear once this year on April 20, but you may notice it the day before too, on April 19. A breakthrough on some level is near, and you will likely be so happy when you get the news.</p>
<p>This April 20 meeting of Jupiter and Uranus is a once-in-a-lifetime shot of good, possibly exciting, news. The next time Jupiter and Uranus will meet, it will be in Cancer in September 2037, a little over 13 years from now. Jupiter and Uranus won’t meet in Taurus again in any of our lifetimes.</p>

        <p>If your birthday falls on May 12, or within five days of that date, you will get a double dip of pleasure, for the degree of the alignment when they meet will be 22 degrees, lining up with that date. If you have a natal planet or your natal moon in Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn, Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces, you will also benefit.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about the full moon of April 23 in Scorpio, 4 degrees, to light your house of marriage, which would also include a serious, steady romantic relationship. Full moons bring closure, so you may be getting engaged or married or hear news from your partner about a development that would affect you both.</p>
<p>Business partnerships are also included in this full moon period (April 23 plus five days). If you have a business collaborator, like an agent, publicist, business partner, manager, social media manager, accountant, bookkeeper, wedding planner, designer, or other person who works with you in a one-on-one confidential way, then this full moon may bring news or a decision about that person.</p>
<p>At the April 23 full moon, Pluto in Aquarius is orbiting in between the Sun in Taurus and the full moon in Scorpio, adding pressure on you from both sides, and Pluto is in your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement. The person in question, applying the tension to you, seems to be more likely to be from the business side of your life rather than the personal or romantic side, but this is not definite because I would need to see your unique chart to know for sure. In your solar chart, Pluto is in your career sector. This person at work seems quite demanding, and although you want to please this person, you need to find a way to deal with the pressure.</p>

        <p>The only alternate way I can think of to describe how this full moon of April 23 may work out is that your partner may be unhappy with the time and attention you are spending at the office. Your partner may feel neglected or diminished by your success. (You are only cranking up—your outlook for career success over the coming 20 years is simply fantastic, thanks to Pluto.) In this case, listen to your partner, and if he or she means a lot to you, reassure your partner that you care. See if you can have a standing date night once a week where all your attention is devoted to your partner. If this all seems too hard to handle and you are not sure you can keep any promises about changing your focus even a little to compromise, you will have the option to leave.</p>
<p>On the plus side, Mars in Pisces will still be sending lovely beams to Jupiter in Taurus, and may be helpful to you. Mars is in your friendship house in giving advice and a new perspective to consider.</p>
<p>Mercury will be retrograde this month, from April 1 to April 25, and misunderstandings and miscommunications may become a big problem. Make sure you are dealing with facts, not inuendo or assumptions. As a Taurus, you like to think things out before you act, and that natural tendency will help you this month. Mars will orbit close to Saturn in the first half of April, sure to slow down the pace even more because Mars is known to say “go,” while Saturn always says “stop”—cautious Saturn will win. If you are quite frustrated with your partner, consider taking things slowly. Don’t be too quick to break up—see how you feel by the end of the month.</p>
<p>If you are single and not in a relationship, or even if you are, you will likely have a lively social life this month. Mars is in Pisces, blazing through your eleventh house of friendships until April 30. You will have plenty of invitations from friends to get you out of the house and into memorable, fun, and interesting social situations.</p>

        <p>One of the most romantic evenings of the month (or even of the whole season) will be April 3 when Venus and Neptune conjoin to create a magically glamourous evening. This is a Wednesday, but even so, make a reservation at a romantic restaurant, and weave an enchanting memory.</p>
<p>If you find you like April very much, wait until May! May will be the most divine month of the year—and with many planets in Taurus, you will be the glittering star of the show, and one dream may come true.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>This will start out to be a quiet month, especially compared to the great celebration next month in May, which is due to be filled with activity and exciting breakthroughs. Many planets will have migrated to Taurus by then to bid farewell to benefic Jupiter, who will still be in Taurus but on his way to the constellation of Gemini on May 25. Jupiter will not be back to your sign for a dozen years. Before Jupiter goes, the other little planets will be gathering in Taurus to help you make the most from Jupiter’s last days in Taurus. They have planned quite a blow-out party for you, and I’ll tell you all about it next month in your May report.</p>
<p>Mercury will be retrograde April 1 to April 25, so this is a month of deep thinking and planning so that next month can be one of your happiest and most productive months of the year, but you’ll need to have your current list of priorities in mind and be ready to jump on opportunities when they appear in May. You will need to be decisive and able to turn at a moment’s notice. This is not Taurus’ usual style—you tend to prefer to quietly think things over—but in May there will be no time. So with Mercury retrograde in April, you will have all the time you need to get ready for May, your wonder month of 2024.</p>

        <p>Yet, you will experience some lovely days in April, too.</p>
<p>On April 8, a new moon solar eclipse will occur and may deliver a piece of news or a secret that had been withheld from you, or concern a matter that you mistakenly dismissed as not important. Now the eclipse will make you pay attention and give you all the details in the glare of daylight. That tidbit of news will come to you in a haphazard way and may help you solve a puzzling situation that had not made sense to you for some time.</p>
<p>The April 8 eclipse might also bring to your attention your mental and physical health. It would be a perfect time to see your doctor or dentist or to have screenings that you know you should have but keep saying you are too busy. You might want to check in with your therapist if anything has been on your mind. You will have time in April, so make those appointments. One hour at the doctor’s office could save your life.</p>
<p>On another note, April will send you a sensational aspect that only happens once in a lifetime. It will happen on or near April 20 when Jupiter will conjoin with Uranus in Taurus. Uranus is the surprise planet that brings news that you’d never imagine happening, and Jupiter brings happiness, growth, and luck. After this month, the next time these two planets will meet again will be in Cancer in September 2037 and will probably not meet again in your lifetime in Taurus. (Jupiter and Uranus will next meet in Taurus on April 7, 2107, 83 years from now.) Every Taurus will have reason to cheer about this unusual event that will be coming your way on April 20. News might be brought to you by a friend.</p>

        <p>If you were born on or within five days of May 12 you will get a double dip of luck.</p>
<p>The full moon in Scorpio on April 23 (not an eclipse) will bring your attention to a close committed partner in love or business. This looks to be more likely about a VIP or expert that you collaborate with at work, for your career houses will be lit up by Pluto and in conversation with the full moon in your marriage/partnership house. This full moon seems to bring to the surface a difference of professional opinion. You may feel pressure to accept your partner’s point of view, and you may feel you have reached an impasse. Come up with an imaginative answer to solve things—it would be preferable if you do. Otherwise, if you don’t, the universe will resolve the matter for you through the events of that full moon, April 23, but it might not be the answer you would have chosen yourself.</p>
