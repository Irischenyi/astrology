        <p>You have a fascinating chart in April, revealing that there’s no doubt you are on the fast track to success. Bigger and better things keep happening in your career. Next month, May, will be an even bigger month for professional progress and could become the crown jewel of the year. This month should make you happy, too.</p>
<p>I say this even though I am fully aware that Mercury will be retrograde from April 1 to April 25. Sometimes rare and brilliant aspects happening in the same month can be so exciting that they minimize any effect of a rogue Mercury. This is one of those months, so stay with me, and I will show you why you should be excited about April.</p>
<p>As this month opens, you are preparing to welcome a new moon solar eclipse in Aries at 19 degrees. This new moon will appear with her entourage—the Sun, Venus, and Mercury—all together in Aries. This is a powerful eclipse for many reasons, but one is that it will be a total eclipse of the Sun, and because the Sun is your ruler, a solar eclipse will always affect you more than a lunar eclipse, like the one you had last month on March 25 in Libra, 5 degrees. This month’s eclipse is a bigger deal, so let’s look closer.</p>
<p>The fact that many celestial bodies are in fire signs, like yours, is a wonderful situation. Also, if you look at your chart, all the planets are circulating above the horizon indicating your life will be far more public and career-oriented this month than private and home-oriented. (This may change a little bit as you get closer to month’s end, at the time of the full moon on April 23, but during the first half of April, and again in early May, this will be evident.)</p>

        <p>Eclipses are in a hurry to bring change but also improved circumstances and progress. Any weak link that an eclipse finds will suddenly be “eclipsed out.”</p>
<p>You have a strong influence involving international travel and relationships thanks to so many planets in Aries, and you may have ventured abroad recently. You seem to have more trips to come. If you can’t travel, you will be on the phone and email with overseas clients and colleagues quite a bit. You may find that a person you are dealing with in another country will depart their company, and you will no longer deal with this individual.</p>
<p>Not all Leos will travel or feel this global influence, so let’s look at the alternative possibilities. Your ninth house is being accented strongly, so you may be very focused on a college or graduate school assignment or goal, or you may be working on a broadcasting or publishing assignment of importance. Legal matters fall in your ninth house too, so you could be attending to a court case. I cannot see all of the planets in your unique horoscope, but from what I CAN see, you will likely make excellent progress in any of these areas.</p>
<p>Pluto is in Aquarius, an air sign, and will blend beautifully with the crowd of heavenly bodies in fiery Aries as well as with the April 8 solar eclipse in Aries. In particular, Pluto will reach out to Venus, the planet that governs the most prestigious career advancement in your chart. Pluto will create a lovely 60-degree sextile with Venus, bringing you opportunity and growth. Show others you are interested in doing more, and you will receive the chance to do so. When I see multiple aspects pointing to the same likely outcome (for you that’s exciting career success), that’s very significant. You have that!</p>
<blockquote><p>On April 20 Jupiter and Uranus will make an exact conjunction in your career house. I see confetti falling over you in celebration at this time.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Pluto is a powerhouse planet, and his position in your collaborative seventh house indicates that you may have an agent, publicist, or lawyer speaking for you to negotiate a fee or pitch an idea, and in the first half of the month, this person will be very effective. If you are married or in a serious, established, exclusive relationship, your partner is likely doing well financially, too.</p>
<p>Mars (Aries ruler) will be the most important planet at this new moon eclipse in Aries, and remarkably, Mars will reach out to Jupiter, still based in your tenth house of career. This is a classic aspect involving the planet of action (Mars) and the planet of good fortune, happiness, healing, growth, and financial success (Jupiter), indicating your actions will lead to profits. Mercury is retrograde now, so be careful—Mercury retrograde can make you distracted, forgetful, misinformed, rushed, or not privy to all the information you need. Be sure you are focused and composed and have completed your due diligence if you have to accomplish something. If you need emergency surgery, have it done immediately, but if you can wait, then maybe schedule it for after Mercury goes direct (April 25). May will be an extraordinary month.</p>
<p>But wait! Something extraordinary is happening right now, this month.</p>
<p>On April 20 Jupiter and Uranus will make an exact conjunction. These are very powerful, slow-moving planets that rarely meet (the next time they conjoin will be September 2037), and this month they are coming together in—you guessed it—your career house. In my mind, I see confetti falling over you in celebration at this time.</p>
<p>The day Jupiter and Uranus make their precise “hit” will be April 20, a Saturday, but you can feel it as early as Thursday, April 18, or Friday, April 19, or possibly as late as Monday, April 22. When this career news strikes, you will be very surprised. This is an aspect of joy, happiness, freedom, hope, and optimism meant to motivate you. You will see that your work has been appreciated and your talents recognized as unique and valuable. This is yet another, amazing aspect that points in the very same direction—your career is clearly rocking skyward, and if you think April is great, wait till you see May.</p>

        <p>Next let’s talk about your money. You seem to be spending more than usual due to Mars in Pisces, a trend that started on March 22. The heavy outflow from your bank account will end once Mars leaves on April 30, so make the most of this aspect. For example, if you planned to look for a job eventually, do so immediately.</p>
<p>Jupiter is set to leave your career sector (tenth house) at the end of next month on May 25. In the meantime, the little planets will be surrounding Jupiter in a sweet crush before they throw him a huge blowout party next month in May—he won’t be back to Taurus and this area of your chart until 2035, so Jupiter’s impending departure is a big deal. (You’ve had Jupiter in your prestigious career house for a full year, since last May.) You will always receive opportunities to advance your career in the future, but right now, it will be far easier to arrive at where you want to be than usual.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to the full moon (not an eclipse) in Scorpio, 4 degrees, on April 23, which will temporarily redirect your attention to your home and family sector. This will happen within four days of this date. Pluto, Scorpio’s ruler, will be in a bad mood and be rather cranky and demanding. Pluto is in your marriage/partnership sector, so it may be that your spouse, live-in, serious, steady sweetheart, or roommate won’t like the ideas you have to redesign your home. There seems to be a push-pull of emotions, adding tension.</p>
<p>The person causing this tension does not have to be a family member, spouse, or roommate, however, for this might be someone who is completing a service for your home, such as a contractor, architect, plumber, designer, landscape artist, or other professional.</p>

        <p>Mars will be of equal importance to grumpy Pluto at this full moon, and here you have a planet in fine shape reaching out to Jupiter and Uranus from your financial eighth house. If you are worried about how much you have been spending lately, Mars’ connection to Jupiter and Uranus at this full moon suggests you will make more money. All of your career success will add up to better compensation, and you will soon bring more cash into your bank account. Mars’ friendly contact with Uranus indicates that you will be pleased and surprised when your request for a raise in salary is confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>An outstanding, friendly new moon solar eclipse is due on April 8 in Aries, and it seems certain to bring exciting changes and progress to your career and income. All year, since last May, you have hosted Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, in your tenth house of prestigious professional advancement, and this month—and in May—you’ll see how much your work and expertise is valued in the marketplace. It will be a wonderful time for you, very possibly your favorite part of 2024.</p>
<p>Leo is ruled by the Sun, so the total solar eclipse of April 8 will have a larger effect on you than last month’slunar eclipse on March 25. News will be illuminating and likely celebratory. If your birthday falls on or within five days of August 10, these changes could be positively life-altering—in the best sense.</p>
<p>Many celestial bodies will have migrated to Aries, a fellow fire sign, in the first half of April, so you will be in your element with a plethora of happy news likely to come your way. Mercury in retrograde will be among the planets in Aries, nevertheless, it seems like you will do well all month, despite the changes and postponements that will almost certainly arise. These planets are highlighting international travel and relationships as well as import-export.</p>

        <p>Travel seems very likely for you in April and would be fine to do as long as you carefully and deliberately plan and then check and double-check your accommodations, flights, and agenda for meetings. Your trip looks to be business-related because Mars (the lead planet at this Aries eclipse) will continue to tour your house of other people’s money, stirring up opportunities.</p>
<p>If you cannot travel, you may be working on an international project over email and phone with people at a great distance. The area of your chart that is being so accented is your ninth house, which works to expand your knowledge of the world.</p>
<p>If you are a college or graduate school student, or hope to be, you may be applying to a new institution ormaking a request for student aid or a loan. If you are currently at a college or university you love, you mightbe working on a special paper you need to hand in. If you have finished your education, you may be focusing on a publishing, broadcasting, or podcast series and negotiating the budget.</p>
<p>A day of mega-importance and celebration is due on April 20 (plus or minus two or three days) when Jupiter, the good fortune planet, will align with Uranus, the planet of surprise. Both will be in Taurus and will shine at the tip-top of your chart in the same house that the April 8 solar eclipse will spotlight—your solar tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement. Your career is on a roll, and there is no stopping you! This alignment will only happen once this year—and the next time these two planets will meet is September 2037. These planets will not come together in Taurus (your career house) again for 83 years. I cannot overstate how major this aspect is for boosting your career skyward—you will be stunned when you receive the wonderfulcareer news.</p>
<p>With Mercury retrograde, your job will be to ensure that everyone on your team is on the same page, with similar expectations, and a unified method to accomplish your shared goal. It would be wise to make sure you have not come to any firm conclusions without the facts to support them. Drawing a number of small assumptions can be tricky now and lead you down the wrong path. April is not the month to begin or launch anything new, but it is the month to do your due diligence prior to starting.</p>

        <p>You seem to be spending more than usual this month, and with Saturn close to Mars, you are being careful and thrifty. You appear to be holding back any elective, high-ticket costs in an effort to space them out.That’s a good idea because your high expenses will drop when Mars leaves Pisces on April 30. Another way this aspect might work out is that you may have been saving up a large sum to pay for something expensive, such as for a down payment on a house or to buy or lease a car, a piece of jewelry, or other goal.</p>
<p>This month is not the right time to buy an expensive product because Mercury retrograde will lower your ability to weigh the pros and cons of your choice. You’d enjoy your purchase much more if you wait until May to buy it. (This holds true if you’re using your credit card, too—so whether you pay in cash or credit, wait until May.)</p>
<p>Your home life will become the center of your attention at the full moon in Scorpio on April 23. A situation is coming to a final stage, but prepare for an obstacle.</p>
<p>It might be that a sudden offer to take a dream job would require you to uproot and move to a new location quite far from where you (and your family) live. At the same time, someone is being quite forceful and demanding of you and trying to block your ability to progress forward on a family -or home-related matter. This person, who seems not to agree with you, could be your roommate, spouse, or other family member, or your tenant, landlord, decorator, contractor, plumber, workman, or another person connected to your family, your home, or to other property you may own, rent, or want to sell.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, you may be concerned about the welfare of a parent or child, or you might suddenly find out your roommate is moving out without much notice.</p>
<p>Still, just when you assume all is lost, Mars will jump into action and contact Jupiter. It seems that the cost of helping to improve the situation will weigh on your shoulders, but Jupiter is in your career house, so all your good work will suddenly (and quite unexpectedly) add up to more money for you. You may receive a large fee, a new client (if self-employed), or a major raise that calms all of your fears.</p>
<p>Mercury will remain retrograde until April 25, so all month, delays will benefit you. I know that sounds hard to believe, but it’s true. So slowly, methodically, and diplomatically negotiate with the person who is being intransigent. Things get settled quickly during full moons, so aim to dissolve the disagreement within four days of the April 23 full moon. The tension will melt away because you will have made your decision.</p>
<p>While April will bring so much fantastic news, especially due to the eclipse on April 8 and the meeting of Jupiter and Uranus on April 20 (both events will affect you for much longer than just a day), you have not seen the end of the glittering razzle-dazzle to come. May will be simply spectacular for your career—you’ve not experienced any of this yet! If you don’t read any more of my forecasts this year for you, make sure you read your MAY forecast.</p>
