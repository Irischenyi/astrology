        <p>You may have heard all about the April 8 solar eclipse, a total eclipse of the Sun in Aries, 19 degrees, and are wondering how this might affect you. A solar eclipse is always a powerful new moon, and this one is friendly to other planets. The moon will appear with her partner, the Sun, and following in her entourage is Venus and Mercury. All these planets are filling your fourth house of home and family, so that is where your attention will be drawn and where you will see the most activity and change.</p>
<p>There are no direct aspects from other planets to the Sun and new moon eclipse, April 8, which is unusual. There will, however, be a strong, friendly beam between Pluto and Venus. Pluto is a major financial planet and is in your sector of salary, savings, and possessions. Venus is based in your home area, so working at home will tend to increase your income (in April as well as in May).</p>
<p>Venus rules your tenth house of professional success, the place where honors and awards are heaped on you, and the place in the chart that reflects how you feel about your greatest achievements and contributions to society. If you are looking for a job, it appears that you will be able to find a great one after the eclipse—it will be prestigious and pay well, too. If you are self-employed, clients will flock to your door on or after April 8.</p>
<p>I cannot see all that is happening in your own chart, but I can see the condition of the Sun and moon. The new moon is putting strong emphasis on your marriage or business partner and on jointly held money (money accrued in a marriage or business), taxes and tax refunds, insurance payments, investments, inheritances (along with wills and estate planning), credit card statements, loans, mortgages, commissions, bonuses, royalties, valuable gifts, court cases, and settlements about money, and other funds that come to you outside of salary.</p>

        <p>With so much emphasis on your home, you may be buying, selling, or renting property or hosting your parents, in-laws, or other family members as guests. Alternatively, you may have repairmen, painters, decorators, architects, landscapers, or contractors working on your home. You might be looking for a vacation home to rent or purchase. A new moon sets up a long period that comprises weeks and months of activity. There are many possibilities.</p>
<p>Mercury is retrograde in Aries and your home sector this month (April 1 to April 25), so this is not the time to close on a house or make important decisions or major purchases, such as for a computer, automobile, stereo, smartphone, iPad, and so forth.</p>
<p>It is a good time to make repairs or to move (label boxes carefully). You can move as long as you signed the paperwork prior to Mercury retrograde, so perhaps you got all the agreements done in March.</p>
<blockquote><p>The very best part of your chart now is activity in your fifth house of new love. You can have fun, relax, carve out more leisure, schedule time with friends, and even find romance.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Mars currently is energizing your short-distance travel sector, a trend that started March 22, and is now orbiting close to Saturn. You will be able to be outdoors to enjoy the new season more often than usual this month. Make sure that your car is in good working order before you head out. With Mercury retrograde, it’s always wise to have your car checked out by your mechanic.</p>
<p>Next month, May, will be a fabulous month and the shining star of 2024. It will not give you time to travel, however, because you will see even MORE emphasis on home and family in May.</p>
<p>The very best part of your chart now (and in May) is your fifth house of new love, if you are single, and more attention from your partner if you are attached. You can have fun, relax, carve out more leisure, and schedule time with friends. This same house rules your children, and they will be enormously protected and pure joy to be around these days. The fifth house rules something else, too—your imagination and creativity, and this is the part of you that is about to bloom quite magnificently by May.</p>
<p>If you are single, be with friends this month, and if you are open to finding a romantic partner, let your friends make introductions on your behalf. If you are unattached and have children, enjoy them this month and in May, which will be an even better month. Plan a special trip or a special surprise for your children.</p>

        <p>I love that at the same time as the eclipse, April 8, Mars will be reaching out to Jupiter and Uranus, both in your house of love and children. If you have worried about the health and overall welfare of one or more of your children, it appears they are doing well, much better than you have expected, and later will realize that you may have been worrying needlessly.</p>
<p>An eclipse in the home sector often signifies change. A person you lived with may now move out (be “eclipsed out”). The change might, instead, go the other way, and you may invite a roommate to live with you to help pay the rent or mortgage. Or a new job may require that you relocate. If your mother is not feeling well, you might invite her to live with you for now—or permanently. See what comes up and how you feel. There is no destiny here—you will get to decide.</p>
<p>Keep your eye on a very rare aspect due on April 20 that you will likely feel both before and after that date—as early as April 18 and as late as April 22. The aspect involves the meeting of good-fortune Jupiter and Uranus, the planet of unanticipated events. Any planet that signals Jupiter produces a magnificent result and together are capable of bringing happiness and a new sense of optimism. The conjunction of these two planets will only happen once this year, on April 20, and then not again until September 2037. These are very slow-moving outer planets and only have the ability to meet one another every 13 years, and rare aspects like this are usually quite noticed.</p>
<p>Best of all for you, these planets are meeting in Taurus at 22 degrees, so if your birthday falls on January 11, plus or minus five days, you will have a double dip of pleasure from this conjunction. The same is true for you if you have Capricorn rising at 22 degrees, plus or minus five degrees, or if you have your natal moon or a natal planet in Capricorn, Virgo, Taurus, Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces within five degrees of 22 degrees.</p>

        <p>Because Jupiter and Uranus are in your truelove-new love sector, which also covers conception, birth, and the care and enjoyment of children, this is where you will feel the benefits of this aspect. It will be so lovely it will be like a fragrant bouquet sent to you from a loving universe. By all means, go out that weekend. You will begin to sense this aspect April 8, but more so as you get closer to April 18 to April 22 when the rays will be really strong.</p>
<p>Again, on April 20 your creativity will be fed the equivalent of tropical plant food, so your output is about to become truly amazing, even surprising you! Be sure to spend time on your craft near that time.</p>
<p>If you are in the middle of a divorce (and I am not seeing this, but I can’t see your unique birth chart from where I sit), rest assured that your children will be cared for and not likely feel scared, at fault, or abandoned, as some children feel after a divorce. With Jupiter in your solar fifth house that rules children (along with creativity, love, and romance), you have the best aspects possible to help your children through this period. When it comes to custody, you should be able to work out a win-win agreement for you and your soon-to-be ex.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the full moon of April 23, which is a little puzzling. On one hand, a full moon in Scorpio at 4 degrees in your glowing eleventh house of joy would bring a lovely social event. It would happen within five days of the date the full moon appears. While you enjoy seeing friends, at this point in April you seem to feel a certain “approach-avoidance” about going. Part of you seems to want to stay home and spend time with your children if they are little, or if they are not small anymore, to spend time with an artistic endeavor. Another part of you wants to see good friends who clearly adore you and want the best for you.</p>

        <p>Pluto, having recently entered Aquarius and your second financial house, is adding to your quandary by sending a tough aspect to the Sun in Taurus and full moon in Scorpio, both of which are social houses for you, so you may not feel like laying out money for this event, even if your spending would simply require buying a new outfit. On the other hand, if you have not seen your friends in a long time, you might be looking forward to seeing several of them. If you have experienced any difficulties lately, being with friends could comfort you, and you may get good advice from them. At the same time, if you have small children, you will need to pay a babysitter, and there’s a part of you that simply wants to be home to be with them. Spending money is not something you will be keen to do.</p>
<p>If you are working on a creative project, you might prefer to continue while you have momentum. As your astrologer, I cannot know what you will decide, but you will know which side of you will win. There will always be more opportunities coming up if you decide to bow out.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Your home life is unusually busy with people coming and going. A total eclipse of the Sun—a powerful new moon—in Aries is falling in this sector of your chart, suggesting a change in your domestic condition is due. You may move house, renovate, redecorate, order a massive paint job, or make important repairs. You may browse many options in a quest to rent a vacation home or get ready to sell property soon.</p>

        <p>Mercury will be retrograde in your home sector from April 1 to April 25, so plan on making your final decisions in May because not all the details will be easy to see this month. Activities such as decluttering, moving, or making repairs are fine and beneficial, but closing on a house or signing a new rental lease is not. Avoid buying new furniture or electronics this month, too.</p>
<p>If the eclipse in Aries of April 8 does not cause you to see changes in your physical space, then there may be a change in your family, such as the arrival of a new baby, or a close relative may move to a different region. Perhaps your parents want to move to a warmer climate.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a roommate move out with no warning, or a new one may arrive at your doorstep. It often happens that the number of people you share your space with will change near the time an eclipse comes by. In another instance, a daughter may move out to go to boarding school, or a roommate may suddenly announce he’s moving out with no prior indication, in which case, that person is “eclipsed out” of your environment.</p>
<p>Eclipses work dramatically and rapidly. Still, despite the changes to those around you who love you—family—they will help you walk across the bridge to the other side of the ravine.</p>
<p>Your love life has been under spectacular vibrations, so you might take the next step with the special person you are seriously dating, such as to move in together to see how things go.</p>

        <p>You have two dazzling aspects this month for love.</p>
<p>If you have not met “the one” yet, watch the weekend of April 19-20. On April 19, Mars will reach out to Jupiter in your truelove sector, so a short trip could prove fruitful—you may meet an intriguing person you’d like to know better.</p>
<p>As crazy as this may sound, if you cannot travel, you could meet someone simply around the neighborhood, such as at the post office or grocery store. (Dress casual, but look your best.)</p>
<p>April 20 will be an even more powerful day when good-fortune Jupiter and unpredictable Uranus will meet in Taurus at 22 degrees in your sector of true love. This is a rare, glittering aspect that is known to bring happiness and hope. (This aspect will not happen again until September 2037, but by then, these two planets will align in a different sign.)</p>
<p>Now Jupiter and Uranus are in Taurus, a fellow earth sign, compatible with your own earth element. All Capricorns should have reason to enjoy that weekend. If you were born on January 11 (plus or minus five days), you will have a double dip of pleasure. Do not stay home!</p>

        <p>Continuing the breathtakingly romantic thread that runs through April, you may be invited to a party or other social event that will take place within five days of the full moon, April 23 (not an eclipse). Or consider giving a cocktail party yourself. If you are single, tell guests to bring one person they would like you to meet for any reason.</p>
<p>You may encounter an obstacle, however, for Pluto in Aquarius, the lead planet at this full moon, will be in conflict with the full moon in Scorpio and Sun in Taurus.</p>
<p>The crux of the problem at the full moon April 23 will likely point to the high cost of participation. I am not sure if you would be willing to go—you seem conflicted. You may want to go, but another side of you wants to stay home. If you have small children, you may simply want to play with them and, for now, avoid the social scene.</p>
<p>If you pass it up you will have other opportunities coming up—glorious ones, due in May, your best month of the year.</p>
