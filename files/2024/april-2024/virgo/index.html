        <p>There are lots of indications that you will like this month. There are plenty of twists and turns, and more than one happy surprise, too. You might say, “How is this possible with my ruling planet, Mercury, retrograde all month?” While it is true Mercury will be in a sleep state from April 1 to April 25, this is no ordinary month.</p>
<p>Some very big cosmic events will take place in April, and they are due to be rare and extraordinary alignments. You are poised to hear good news. If you meet an obstacle, it looks like you will be able to find a solution. This is such a big month, you may hardly notice little Mercury’s antics, such as his trademark delays, forgetfulness, and inability to make a decision.</p>
<p>As the month opens, planets are moving into your financial eighth house of other people’s money: Venus, your ruler Mercury, the Sun, and the new moon solar eclipse of April 8, all in the adventuresome and entrepreneurial sign of Aries. This eclipse is a big one, and you have probably already heard news reports about it on TV. A solar eclipse only occurs on a new moon—but one so strong, it feels like it’s on steroids—and new moons open new opportunities, offers, and situations. Eclipses always push us forward into the future.</p>
<p>At the time of the eclipse, Mars (Aries’ ruler) will be the most important planet, leading the outcome of any given situation, so we have to see if he is having any interactions with other planets. Remarkably, Mars is found reaching out to Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, and Jupiter happens to be traveling with Uranus, the planet of surprise, so Mars will be speaking to both.</p>

        <p>This suggests you are about to see a large sum of money as a result of the eclipse. I have found that money from the eighth house tends to come in a lump sum. Examples could be a court settlement or divorce agreement that goes in your favor. It could come in the form of a scholarship, generous financial aid, a large fee from a recently finished project, or a cash advance when you sign a book contract. You could also win a contest or find out that a long-lost relative has named you in their will. You may sell something expensive, such as property, or your parents may help you put a down payment on a house. There are many possible sources of your windfall.</p>
<p>Mars is currently in your seventh house of partnership and marriage, so this suggests you will have a middleman involved that will link you to your financial luck. This could be a former romantic partner, your lawyer, or an agent. Or your accountant may find you are due a large tax refund.</p>
<p>At the same time this theme is emerging, there is another, quite different one bubbling up in your ninth house. International travel is very likely because you have Jupiter in this area of your chart, and when Jupiter is in your ninth house, he has the job of expanding your understanding of the world around you. Uranus is also in this house—he’s been there for several years—but the difference is that now these two planets are getting very close and will make a perfect alignment in fellow earth-sign Taurus on April 20 at 22 degrees.</p>

        <p>You may assume this is not a big deal, but this is the only time these two planets are meeting this year, and the next time they meet will be a whopping 13 years from now, in September 2037 (the last time these two planets met was January 2011). Something is shaping up in this house that will be very beneficial to you. Watch what happens on April 20 and the surrounding days.</p>
<p>You may take a spontaneous trip to another country, and it appears that your trip is work-related, although you may be able to add personal time to enjoy yourself while you are away. If you have too many people who need you at home, then you may be working with clients in foreign countries via phone and email. The focus on a different culture will be quite strong.</p>
<p>If you do not have an international situation going on, you may be focused on getting an additional degree. On or close to April 20, you may make a good impression during an interview with the admissions director of the university that you would love to be admitted to. On or near this date, you may get the results of a major qualifying test you took—and find out that you aced it. A matter involving your quest for an undergraduate or graduate degree at an institution of higher learning seems to be involved (assuming you are not working on an international situation).</p>
<p>You might be working on writing or editing an important book that will be high-profile or a special cover story for a magazine or Internet site. If you are a producer, this month you may be working on a television show that you sold. If you are involved in a legal case, as a lawyer or as a person who brought the suit, it could be a landmark case, and you may be giving it all your concentration.</p>

        <p>Mars will be in perfect angle to Jupiter and Uranus, so news will be sudden and thrilling. Whatever is happening in one of these areas listed above will grow even bigger in May. Next month will make you deliriously happy—it’s the best month of the year for you.</p>
<p>All Virgos will have reason to be excited about the alignment of Jupiter and Uranus, and if your birthday falls on or close to September 14, the degrees of Jupiter and Uranus will reach out to your Sun sign. The same is true if you have Virgo rising at 22 degrees (plus or minus four degrees), or if you have a natal planet in Virgo within four degrees of 22 degrees, you will have a double dip of pleasure.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to the full moon (not an eclipse) on April 23, which will fall in Scorpio. This full moon has pros and cons. Pluto in Aquarius will be in a bad mood and press on the Sun in Taurus and the full moon in Scorpio. Pluto is in your work-a-day area, so this pressure is more likely to come from colleagues or software that is not working quite right. Or a client may be very demanding—unfairly so—and put a lot of pressure on you to calm the waters. Your reputation for excellent work is known, however, and this full moon will not harm how VIPs view you. Nevertheless, an important deal may be harder to close than you anticipated.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Mars and Jupiter will be in a perfect angle, a rare aspect that suggests the actions you agree on will lead to profit. Although Mars and Jupiter make their aspect on April 19, you will still have the benefits of this lovely aspect during the full moon on April 23. You may not get everything you want from this demanding person you are negotiating with, but the job may be so big, it would be worth doing anyway.</p>

        <p>Besides, Mars will be keeping his eye on you and doing all he can to help. This will mitigate the effects of Pluto, especially since Mars and Pluto are associated with Scorpio.</p>
<p>Be excited dear Virgo—you will find April exciting, and next month, May, completely divine.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You’ve just come through a lunar eclipse on March 25, a full moon that brought a conclusion to a financial matter. You may have been given a new project or assignment, or if you work for others, you may have received a raise. Alternatively, you may have spent a sum of money to purchase goods or services for yourself or your company. Neptune was opposed to the full moon last month (March 25 plus five days), so facts were oddly unclear, and with Mercury retrograde on the way only adding to the foggy atmosphere, making a final decision may have seemed almost impossible.</p>
<p>On April 8, a more important eclipse is due, for it is a new moon total eclipse of the Sun. Let’s talk about it now. This will be a friendly eclipse, especially when compared to the eclipses that you have experienced in the past. This April 8 eclipse will energize your financial eighth house, which is your house of other people’s money—again, you have every reason to expect good news.</p>
<p>The news may come in the form of a one-time large sum, such as a large commission, royalty, bonus, or news from a bank that a loan or mortgage application has been approved. You may receive venture capital, or if you are selling real estate, it appears you will get an attractive bid that you will want to accept. An insurance company may now send a pleasing payout for a claim you sent in.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, news may come from your university about financial aid. Your health insurance company may write to say that a surgery or medicine you need will be fully covered. You may be given an inheritance this month, or the courts may award you a large sum of money from a case or divorce settlement. There are many possibilities.</p>
<p>The point is, the money you see is likely to come from a source other than your salary, and it looks like it will be unexpectedly generous. Truly, you seem to have the Midas touch—you can attract money in many different ways. If you can, however, wait until early May to finish any legal paperwork to avoid Mercury retrograde (April 1-25).</p>
<p>Often an eclipse will “eclipse out” a previous source of money you assumed was stable. The eclipse will move you into the future, into fresh new areas of your life, and ask you to leave the past behind.</p>
<p>Here is an example: You are used to depending on a year-end bonus (typically paid out in the first few months of the following year) but now learn you won’t because your present employer suffered poor profits in the past year. Or you may lose a loyal client through no fault of your own. To fill the vacuum of this empty space, the universe will shortly give you money from a new source, so have faith—it’s coming. You stand to benefit quite a bit financially from this April 8 eclipse.</p>

        <p>Now let’s turn to another trend growing large in your chart—the possibility for travel. You have been concentrating hard at work and focusing on little else. You need a little relief and rest, and travel would be the perfect antidote. Happily, travel is written all over your chart, and indications are strong that you’ll be flying to exciting distant locations.</p>
<p>Travel is fine during Mercury retrograde as long as you put Apple air-tag trackers in your luggage, double-check all accommodations, and show up at the airport early so you don’t miss your flight. Best time to go: April 19 (a Friday) and on the days that follow.</p>
<p>Other big news this month involves April 20, a day that deserves a gold star on your calendar. On that day, plus or minus three days, Jupiter and Uranus will meet in Taurus, a fellow earth sign to your Sun sign Virgo. You can expect an uplifting, exciting surprise to arrive, and it could come in a variety of forms. This alignment is tied in theme to the April 8 eclipse because Jupiter and Uranus will already be within a significant mathematical degree of influence at that time (in other words, these two planets will be close enough for you to feel their effect). In truth, you will feel this generous financial trend throughout the first three weeks of April. Lovely!</p>
<p>News could involve distant travel or emanate from an international relationship that will tell you that a deal based in an international city is in the works for you. Or it may involve good news about a legal matter and the courts. Money may stem from an institution of higher education if you have applied for a grant, scholarship, or financial aid. The news could also involve a broadcasting or publishing project with your name on it—in fact, your book may be published, or your screenplay may be suddenly optioned by a major movie studio.</p>

        <p>Jupiter conjunct Uranus is a rare aspect that only comes by every 13 years, and this will not happen again until September 8, 2037. At that time, these two planets will be in a different sign and a different house of your horoscope.</p>
<p>The full moon in Scorpio of April 23 (not an eclipse) will give you another option to travel, and again it seems more likely to be for business. It appears you will go to see a client face-to-face, most likely to conclude a deal, but here’s a fair warning—doing so won’t be easy. Pluto will be the lead planet and in a difficult, crusty, aggressive mood.</p>
<p>Your client seems to be a savvy negotiator, and powerful, too. You may need this deal to work out for you, but you may not like the terms the client is demanding. The saying, “the 800-lb gorilla can sit anywhere he pleases” fits here. You will need to figure out how to do the job under less than ideal conditions. As a Virgo, you are naturally flexible, and that will be an asset here. Stay alert, and offer a variety of options. Mars and Jupiter will work together to help you bring this deal across the finish line, although admittedly you may not get everything you want. Sometimes a deal is so big, it’s worth doing anyway—you make up profits from sheer volume. See how you feel, and keep your wits about you.</p>
<p>You may have a contract to sign, but Mercury is still unstable, and it would be best to put off the signing until May, one of your very best months of the year.</p>
