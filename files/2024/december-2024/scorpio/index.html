        <p>Your chart is simply sensational for high-ranking professional progress. Mars, one of your rulers, will spend an unusual amount of time in your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement in the coming months, so I can only imagine something very special must be going on in your career. You may already know what I am referring to, or it might be that you are about to find out soon. Amazing opportunities to show your talents at work are on the way and will keep coming. I will explain why.</p>
<p>Mars is your ancient ruler, and Pluto was added as your modern ruler when this planet was discovered in February 1930. Modern astrologers look at both planets when examining the current influences in your chart. This month Mars will be making all the news for you. In Scorpio’s solar chart, Mars is the natural ruler of your sixth house of work-a-day projects, so the assignment you are focused on could display your maturity, leadership ability, and creativity, especially when you are under unexpected circumstances in which you have to pivot to your Plan B to keep everything on track.</p>
<p>Mars is about to retrograde on December 6 and will continue to move backward until February 23, 2025, a period of about 11 weeks. Mars does not retrograde often—it happens every two years—so this trend may feel somewhat unfamiliar. Mars is considered the action planet that teaches us how to compete. When Mars retrogrades, you can still be productive, but you might find it will take more time, energy, and money to accomplish what you want to do.</p>
<p>Now you may be thinking, “Oh this is terrible! I had to wait two years for Mars to return to Leo and journey to my tenth house of prestigious career success, but as luck would have it, Mars has to be weaker than usual in retrograde. Now do I have to wait another two years for Mars to return to Leo and be in better shape?”</p>

        <p>No, dear Scorpio, you won’t have to wait two years. The universe is being kind to you. Once you get to January 6, 2025, Mars will retrograde into Cancer—a highly compatible place for you, marking a possible time for you to travel to distant points or to work with people in international settings. (Stay with me, dear Scorpio, as I am getting to an important point.)</p>
<p>After moving backward in Cancer, Mars will finally reverse course on February 23, 2025, and turn direct in Cancer. Here’s the good news—as Mars ventures forward, he will return to Leo on April 17, to stay until June 17, and will be as strong as Hercules in your tenth house of professional success. At that time, you will have an open road to make your mark in your career without the crosscurrents you have now. Everything at work will seem enormously easier. Also, Mars’ little brother, Mercury—a tiny Wreck-It Ralph—will be normal during that period, so you won’t have Mercury retrograde to deal with either. (Yes, Mercury will be retrograde. More about that in a moment.)</p>
<p>You seem to be working on an important assignment, and with Mars retrograde, you will have to remain flexible and resourceful as things sometimes won’t go as planned.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mars will brilliantly light up your prestigious career sector like a jumbotron in Times Square and put you in position to raise your profile.</p></blockquote>

        <p>You’ve had this exact retrograde in Leo and your house of career from December 20, 2009, to March 10, 2010. I am not sure you can recall that period—it was 15 years ago—or if you were even in the workforce back then (you might have been too young). I list this period in case that timeframe resonates with you. Of course, all the other planets surrounding Mars in Leo will have since changed signs and houses in your horoscope. Nothing in life, or astrology, repeats again in precisely the same way. If you can remember back to 2009, it might give you a clue of what’s coming.</p>
<p>To complicate this situation a bit more, Mars’ little brother Mercury had a head start on his retrograde—Mercury started moving backward on November 25, and he will go direct on December 15. Everyone will be affected in one way or another by these two retrogrades of Mercury and Mars. You will not be at a disadvantage, however, because everyone will be in the same boat. When delays or backtracking become necessary, take the news with a shrug and a smile.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Mercury is retrograding in Sagittarius, and Sagittarius is a fire sign that blends well with action Mars in fire-sign Leo. Little Mercury is currently retrograding in your financial second house, so if anyone owes you money, you might have to wait a bit before you’re paid, but I feel it will come later in December. You may have the “work now and get paid later” vibe—I think you will receive this cash, and the sum could be generous.</p>
<p>Speaking of money, ironically, the new moon that will appear on November 30 or December 1 (depending on your time zone) will be in your second house, which rules personal income—salary, fees, and other cash you earn or are given as a gift. This house also governs savings and possessions. This new moon will fall in Sagittarius, 10 degrees.</p>

        <p>I love that Mars in your tenth house of professional success will send a brilliant beam of direct light to both the Sun (which rules Leo and your career) and this new moon. The interaction of Mars with this new moon tells me that you will do well, even if you encounter a few hiccups along the way this month. VIPs will be impressed with your performance, and a generous sum of money could be on the way to you, now or in weeks ahead.</p>
<p>This new moon is one of the best of the year for you to ask for an increase in salary. If you are self-employed, pitch new clients because you are in a position to bring in lucrative new business. Yes, I say this even with both Mars and Mercury retrograde. A new moon is influential for weeks and months, and this one will give you beneficial effects for five and a half months—and its strongest powers are set to happen at the onset, in the first 10 days of December.</p>
<p>Over the course of the five and a half months after December 1, the strength of this new moon will very gradually decline until it has depleted all of its powers and is ready to let the full moon (June 11) in the same sign (Sagittarius) take over.</p>
<p>The reason I like this new moon on December 1 so much is that it will work in collaboration with Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, now in Gemini. This new moon places Jupiter first in importance before the other planets, so this is doubly important. The new moon will make you optimistic about your future earnings—for good reason.</p>

        <p>I will admit that Saturn in Pisces will be in hard angle to the new moon on December 1, so you may feel pressure from the home front because Saturn is touring your fifth house of love and children. You may be concerned that your child will stay happy and well cared for while all this commotion is going on in your career. You will be working hard, but keep in mind that sergeant Saturn, the planet that makes demands, is in compatible water-sign Pisces, which means that you will absorb the teachings of Saturn more easily than most and find solutions to keep all the elements in your life on an even keel, balanced, and moving forward.</p>
<p>Let’s look at another way Saturn may deliver a challenge. Instead of concern for the well-being of your child, if you are involved in an important romantic relationship, Saturn’s position might indicate that the object of your affection is getting impatient with your intense need to work long hours. It may also be that your partner will become a bit jealous that your career is skyrocketing while, in comparison, his or hers is not.</p>
<p>Everything will become better after Mars slips into Cancer on January 6, 2025, so realize that this is a temporary situation. When Mars returns to Leo and your lofty professional house of impressive advancement from April 17, 2025, to June 17, 2025, you will not have the headwinds you have to deal with now.</p>
<p>Now let’s move to the full moon of December 15 in Gemini, which is poised to bring a financial matter to fullness and closure. Good-fortune Jupiter is in this same financial house of other people’s money and will be within the range of influence (wide, 8 degrees) to this full moon. This suggests that you could receive a large bonus or commission within five days after this full moon arrives. Since Saturn will again put pressure on you, money will come in and go out, but even so, you will get to keep a good portion of this cash after your bills are paid.</p>

        <p>Mercury is taking control of this December 15 full moon, and remarkably, he will be in your earned income sector in perfect, tight aspect to Mars at the very pinnacle of your chart—your career sector (tenth house). The applause for your work well done will be very flattering. Full moons bring a finish, so this culmination will happen within five days of this full moon, spanning from December 15 to December 20. It could be that a source of income is ending as you begin a job with another company or client. Or it may simply mean that a very large project is wrapping up—for example, you might be a director and see your film finally done—and now it’s time to show it to the world.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to Christmas Day and Chanukah (which fall on the same date, December 25). This festive time should please you—the transiting moon will be in Scorpio, favoring you. You can arrange everything precisely as you want it to be, and all your efforts to create a magical holiday will be rewarded on this special day.</p>
<p>In this action-packed month, believe it or not, we have another new moon on December 30 in Capricorn, 10 degrees. This new moon will shine in your third house of communication, so you may be preparing to negotiate a deal or draw up a contract for you and another party to sign. This will likely usher in an enormously busy week with emails, phone calls, and meetings swirling around you. Mars will still be in Leo, but only until January 6, 2025, so after that, you might be able to take a little short trip into the countryside to breathe fresh air and unwind. The new moon in Capricorn on December 30 will help make that happen.</p>
<p>Saturn will be the key planet during this new moon, and for a wonderful change, instead of Saturn testing you, he will reward you. Whatever you do after this new moon should bring a warm feeling of safety, security, and stability. If you have children, you will be able to spend quality time with them and have bushels of fun together.</p>

        <p>If your birthday falls on November 2, plus or minus five days, you will notice the benefits of this new moon. The same is true for you if your natal moon is in Scorpio or you have Scorpio rising at 10 degrees, plus or minus five degrees in either case. Take a look at your birth horoscope and see if you have a natal planet in Scorpio, Cancer, Pisces, Taurus, Virgo, or Capricorn at 10 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. If you do, that planet will go out of his way to noticeably help you. Wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>It’s holiday time, which is usually a period of the year that’s marked by a higher-than-usual level of spending, but luckily, you will have just experienced a new moon in your earned income sector on November 30 or December 1 (depending on your time zone). You could receive a raise or bonus, or a gift of cash might arrive soon, within the first two weeks of December. Extra money will come in handy—it seems you’ve had to spend quite a bit on your child (or child care) or another family member who needed your financial support. If you are working on a personal creative project, your expenses might be higher than you’d estimated originally.</p>
<p>You seem determined to take control of your finances, and at the full moon on December 15, you could finalize talks or actions. In that respect, you may shake hands on a new project, and a fee or bank loan might bring a generous sum. If you put in an application for a mortgage or infusion of venture capital (as two examples), it could be approved within five days after this full moon appears on December 15. Good-fortune Jupiter will orbit close to this transiting full moon—a lovely indication that you are in line for a solid amount of money. With the December 15 full moon in Gemini, the sign of the Twins, this cash might come from two sources.</p>
<p>This full moon will put extra emphasis on Mercury, which remarkably, will be friendly to Pluto in your fourth house of home, property, and family, indicating that a sale of real estate or money from a relative might be the source of your extra income. Mercury will also be perfectly companionable with Mars, your ruler, currently blazing through your tenth house of honors, awards, and professional achievement. Mars first entered Leo and this vital career advancement area of your chart on November 3, to stay until January 6, 2025, and Mercury’s friendliness to Mars shows your performance at work is impressing VIPs and could result in a sum of money for you, possibly as a bonus.</p>

        <p>December 15 is also the day Mercury goes direct, having been retrograde since November 25. It will take Mercury until January 2, 2025, to be fully strong again, but each day from December 15 will bring better and better results from Mercury.</p>
<p>Mars, however, will be retrograde starting December 6 and extending nearly three months, until February 23, 2025. When any planet retrogrades, it’s a good time to look back and make improvements. You will be examining what worked and what did not in regard to the professional actions you’ve taken. If you start a new job, ask about historical events and how those were managed to understand what worked and what did not. December and January will be a period of tweaking your strategy in preparation for your upcoming projects—the most important and potentially most successful ones will occur from April 17 to June 17 when Mars returns to Leo and your prestigious career sector.</p>
<p>With such a strong emphasis on career and money, you’ll want to plan a getaway, and you can, thanks to a friendly new moon on December 30 in Capricorn, which will increase your opportunities to pack and go to a location near your home (within 200 miles). You won’t be able to travel far because family and job obligations will weigh on you. If you are able to manage a few days in a new setting, going away will allow you to relax and boost your morale. You have a big New Year ahead—celebrate it!</p>
