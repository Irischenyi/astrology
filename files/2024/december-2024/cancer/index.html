        <p>Life is busy in December with a lot of details to cover. On November 30 or December 1 (depending on your time zone), a new moon will arrive with her partner, the Sun, in Sagittarius, 10 degrees, in your sixth house of work projects. Both at home and at work, there will be people to see, places to go, and things to get done.</p>
<p>Saturn in Pisces will be in hard, square angle to the Sun, so you will feel pressure—see if you can enlist family members or hire an assistant to help you polish off your list. The good news is that benefic Jupiter is taking a dominant role during this time and will be friendly to the new moon. You are ruled by the moon—this is a good sign that you will like what transpires. Good-fortune Jupiter will keep you cheerful and ready to handle anything life throws your way. You’ll just laugh and say, “Bring it on!”</p>
<p>Mars is ready to help you from his perch in your second house of earned income. This tells me that the work you will be doing will represent a hefty amount of business, so if you are self-employed or work in sales, that should add up to money for you. If you work for others, you may be able to get a temporary part-time job as another way of generating side income.</p>
<p>The sixth house, so lit up for you at the start of the month, would also be the time to get your annual physical exam. Not only is it a good time to check your cholesterol, blood pressure, and so forth, it’s also time to get your eye exam, schedule a dental cleaning, and maybe work on other screenings, such has a prostate exam for guys or a mammogram for women. You know the tests you are supposed to have—now is the time to check them off your list so you can start the New Year in great condition. Spending an hour or two at the doctor’s office can mean the difference between a long or short life.</p>

        <p>Speaking of health, you have a lot to do this month, and I worry that you will deplete your ability to fend off a cold or the flu. Do all you can to stay strong. If your doctor suggests a vaccination or certain vitamins, follow his or her instructions. The full moon on December 15 could show you how you are doing, for this full moon will appear in Gemini in your twelfth house. Luckily for you, the full moon will be orbiting within range of benefic Jupiter, which could help you stay strong. I want you to get enough sleep and eat nutritiously, because I don’t want you to get sick so close to Christmas (and for our Jewish friends, Chanukah—both holidays fall on December 25 this year, which is unusual).</p>
<p>The December 15 full moon in Gemini lights up your twelfth house, which deals with matters hidden from view. This full moon may deliver its message by giving you a vital piece of information that you never knew anything about—someone in your life had kept it from you. Neptune has been retrograde since July 2 and will go direct a few days prior to the full moon’s appearance, giving the full moon extra clout. Neptune will be in hard aspect to the full moon, pushing out the information you need so that you can protect yourself and plan accordingly. Saturn will square Jupiter, so some sort of restructuring might be in order, possibly financial in nature.</p>
<p>Mars is moving through your second house of earned income, driving up expenses more than usual. You might say that December is expensive for everyone, and that is true, but this year your spending seems even higher than usual. Mars will move toward a direct opposition to Pluto, both in financial houses, to peak on January 3, so you may be pressured to pay a large sum at December’s end, and it might be difficult to do. This notice to pay will likely come up on the last day of the month, so you have time to prepare for it (and you know what that payment would be for).</p>
<blockquote><p>Good-fortune Jupiter will keep you cheerful and ready to handle anything life throws your way in December.</p></blockquote>

        <p>December 25, the date of both Christmas and Chanukah this year, could turn out to be quite romantic for you because the transiting moon will fall in Scorpio, a water sign like yours, dear Cancer. The moon will be in the perfect place for you, suggesting all your efforts to make the holiday special will be worth your loving energy.</p>
<p>You have another new moon on December 30 in Capricorn, and that new moon will give you quality time to devote to your one-and-only partner. A new moon can mark the start of a new chapter in your relationship, so if you are dating seriously, you might get engaged. If you are married, you may choose an exciting goal to complete together. Saturn will be the most important planet at this new moon, and magically, Saturn is the planet that will reach out to the Sun and new moon to offer his gifts of stability and longevity to your relationship.</p>
<p>All new moons are influential not only for a day or two, but for months to come, and they are at their strongest in the week to 10 days after they appear. Your seventh house of marriage, where this new moon is appearing on December 30, is basically a contractual house, where a solemn, legal promise is made to another individual. For that reason, business alliances and agreements are covered under the seventh house, too.</p>
<p>If you are not planning to get engaged under the colorful fireworks of the New Year’s celebrations, you might be ready to draw up papers to hire a specialist or expert at work (or for you personally) who you can collaborate with in a confidential, one-on-one way. You might hire a new accountant, lawyer, interior designer, wedding planner, or social media director, or you may be ready to hire a new advertising agency, web design company, or other person or company you’ve decided you need to make a success of a goal.</p>

        <p>Mars will begin to retrograde this month, from December 6 to February 23, a total of over 11 weeks. Since Cancer’s solar tenth house of professional advancement has Aries on the cusp (and Mars rules Aries), Mars’ slowdown will strongly affect your career progress. You may become frustrated when you see that clients are skittish and hesitant to sign your proposal and are taking forever to decide (if they decide at all).</p>
<p>However, they’d be right to wait. It’s simply not a good time to begin a new venture with a weak, lagging Mars—there is no way Mars will be supplying his high-octane energy.</p>
<p>Mars teaches us how to compete and win. While Mars is asleep, you can still compete, but it will take much more time, energy, and money to win. Everyone will be in the same boat. The retrogrades that we feel the strongest are those of the planets that orbit closest to earth, namely Mercury, Mars, and Venus.</p>
<p>Mars’ little brother Mercury, planet of communication, shipping, travel, machines, and technology, will go to sleep November 25, not to wake up until December 15, and he won’t be fully functional until January 2. Keep in mind, you will get increasing help every day from December 15 onward—the planet continues to help you more as he gets stronger.</p>
<p>When the red planet Mars awakens on February 23, things will improve gradually, for Mars does not suddenly jump back to life the day he goes direct, either. It will take him until April 30 to be as strong as he was before the retrograde.</p>

        <p>I might as well drop the other shoe. Venus will retrograde from March 1 to April 12, and Venus affects love and romance, marriage, parties, fun, charity fundraisers, and your appearance. None of these activities are favored during Venus retrograde. Also, don’t schedule Botox or fillers at this time, nor should you make a very dramatic change to your hair (trims and touch-ups are fine.)</p>
<p>Venus also has some say over profits. If you work in the beauty, jewelry, or luxury goods industry, Venus has a strong influence over your work. This would not be the time to launch a new product or service or to debut a new advertising campaign. For you, dear Cancer, Venus also rules your home and family life, so this would not be the time to buy a house or make a decision on behalf of a family member. As said, Venus will go retrograde March 1 and won’t go direct until April 12. It will take Venus until May 16 to be as strong as she was prior to the retrograde.</p>
<p>As you see, until we reach May, we will be dealing with a slew of important retrogrades that won’t be good for growing the economy. (The United States is Cancer, born on July 4). Again, you will not lose any competitive advantage because everyone will be dealing with a weak Mars in one way or another.</p>
<p>What are retrograde planets good for? You might be asking that question and assume that retrogrades have no value at all, but they do. They urge us to look back and to reflect on what went right—and what didn’t go as well as we had hoped. What did we learn from that experience? We all want to continually move forward, but the universe tells us there is value in looking back, too.</p>

        <p>You have a spectacular year ahead. Starting on June 9, 2025, and continuing for a year, Jupiter will be in Cancer, and it doesn’t get any better than that! Everyone will want to be you!</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Life in December will be hectic but productive. You might work in a seasonal business where holiday shopping brings a lion’s share of the company’s profits, but this year will be different from last year. Mercury started to retrograde last month on November 25 and will remain retrograde until December 15. Mercury rules transportation, shipping, commerce, and communication, and during the retrograde, all these areas will move maddeningly slowly. You will have to be focused and deliberate in all you do, especially when shipping gifts to friends and family. Aim to ship everything in the first week so that you will be sure to avoid any disappointing delays.</p>
<p>You need to anticipate an additional complication. Mercury’s big brother Mars will start to retrograde on December 6, and he is due to end his backward slide over 11 weeks later on February 23 (yes, retrograding for nearly three months). Even after Mars goes direct, it will take until April 30 before Mars returns to his former robust strength (but life will feel better day by day after February 23). Overall, this is a problem for everyone, for Mars is the fuel you put in your car to make it go. It is the energy of your stove that you turn on to cook your soup. This means the New Year will have a slow start.</p>
<p>For you, Cancer, Mars rules your solar prestigious tenth house of career advancement. With Mars asleep at the wheel, you can make progress, but you will need to work harder than usual to make it happen. This progress will come, but it will arrive at a slower pace than you anticipate. Any planet that is in retrograde asks us to look back, review our work, and make tweaks and changes to our strategies.</p>

        <p>When Mars is retrograde, clients and customers will be indecisive and hesitant to move forward—they tend to take their time to make decisions on large expenditures. And of course, no one should spend on high-ticket items with Mercury retrograde, and that will clear up on December 15. Unfortunately, Mars overlapping with Mercury in retrograde will keep things moving slowly for months.</p>
<p>It may help to know that Mars will start to retrograde in Leo on December 6 in your personal second solar house of income and spending. (Point of clarity: Mars RULES your solar tenth house of prestigious career advancement, but Mars is currently IN your income sector.) Your spending will be high in December (as it was in November), and this trend will end once you get to January 6.</p>
<p>On January 6, Mars will move back into Cancer, continuing to retrograde until February 23. Once moving direct, Mars will remain in Cancer until April 17, and you will become motivated to find innovative ways to improve business and many other areas of your life. Clients will become more interested in your proposals, and they will be more willing to move forward by the end of April. By May, you will feel better. In the meantime, you will need the patience to be content to see small increments of progress.</p>
<p>It’s December, so you might be thinking about your New Year’s resolutions, and one of your resolutions might be to increase your fitness. Gyms have monthly quotas for membership sales that their managers are expected to meet, so if you do want to join a gym, you might get a better deal in early December. Most gym sales of memberships are at their lowest point in December, so go for it this month. Memberships are often at their height in January or February.</p>

        <p>The ancient astrologers long understood the positive impact that small domestic pets have on the health of their owners, something we are only understanding more fully now. Pets make their owners happier and possibly also healthier, and that must be the reason puppies and kittens, dogs, and cats are covered by the sixth house, which is known to rule our overall health, too. If you were hoping to add a new pet to your household, it would be worthwhile to go over to the animal shelter in early December to see if a little furry creature calls out to you to care for him.</p>
<p>The sixth house also deals with work, but work you do each day, not the type of work that will elevate your career. If you start a job now, it would likely be similar to the level you had before and not represent a step up. There are times in life that we don’t want a promotion if too much is going on in other areas (perhaps you are caring for a parent or a new baby, as two examples).</p>
<p>This is an expensive month for most people, but more so for you, as you have Mars strongly increasing expenses while moving through Leo in your second house of savings, possessions, and income. You might be interested in finding a temporary side job to earn extra money for holiday shopping. If so, the new moon that arrives November 30-December 1 (depending on your time zone) will help you find the kind of work you are looking for in the first week or two of December.</p>
<p>Taskmaster Saturn in Pisces will be in hard angle to the new moon and Sun in Sagittarius, 9 degrees, so Saturn will ask you to work hard. Even so, Saturn can have an energizing effect on you. Like the axiom says, “If you need something done quickly and thoroughly, ask a busy person to do it.” So true—that would be you! At the same time, Mars, currently touring your income house, will be supportive of this particular new moon in Sagittarius (November 30 or December 1) and for the weeks that follow it. This new moon will fall in your assignment sector, a signal that you could amass a tidy sum of gold coins for your effort. This is true even though Mars in retrograde is in a weakened condition. Someone you worked for in the past or interviewed with previously may be the one who hires you now.</p>

        <p>The full moon on December 15 will appear in Gemini, and this will be a time to slow down. You will be working hard this month, and with the full moon due to appear in your twelfth house, you may be dragging your little feathers. Do everything you can to avoid getting a cold at this point of the month. If your doctor has suggested you take certain vitamins, or if you plan to get a flu or COVID shot, do so early in the month, as it takes two weeks for them to start working.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this full moon in Gemini might be good for you because it will arrive close to lucky Jupiter. The moon rules Cancer, so this is so fortunate! Spending private, quality time with the people who mean the most to you will be very satisfying from this point on. Hopefully your job won’t be as demanding after this full moon of December 15, allowing you to devote yourself more fully to enjoying the holidays.</p>
<p>By the new moon of December 30 in Capricorn, 10 degrees, you’ll only have eyes for your sweetheart or spouse. This new moon will open the door to commitment, so many Cancers will get engaged in time for New Year’s Eve. Married couples will dream together and come up with a new goal to work on to make more of their relationship. The goal may be to save for a house, for example, or to start a family. There are many possibilities. Saturn will provide consistency and steadfast determination to reach your goal. It’s a joyous new moon, and one that might start you off in an exciting new direction.</p>
