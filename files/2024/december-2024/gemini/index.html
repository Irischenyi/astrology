        <p>As you begin December, you will be thinking about a close alliance, whether in love or in business. The new moon of November 30 or December 1 (the date of the new moon depends on your time zone) will appear in Sagittarius, 10 degrees, and light your house of serious, committed partnerships in business and also in love and marriage. This new moon may bring on a time of assessment. If you are in love, you might be eager to marry and begin your life together.</p>
<p>Jupiter in Gemini will help you decide what is best for you. If the relationship is business oriented and with Saturn in your tenth house of reputation and hard work, you may feel a business partner or collaborator (such as an agent, publicist, or if you are the expert, the talent you represent) is not pulling their share of the weight in the relationship. At the same time, Mars, positioned in your third house, shows communication between the two of you is clear and fluid. You see certain benefits to this union.</p>
<p>The planets are giving you mixed messages, and you may feel ambivalent about what to do. It might not be the best time to decide for several reasons. First, your ruler Mercury is in Sagittarius and your partnership house (the very same house that is being highlighted by the new moon December 1), but Mercury began to retrograde last month on November 25 and will continue his backward slide until December 15.</p>
<p>No planet adjusts its orbit instantly on the day it goes direct. In fact, a planet is the most unstable the day before and after its official retrograde bookend dates. I have friends who rush to sign a contract the day before a retrograde or on the day after it turns direct, but in truth, those are the worst days possible to swing into action. Give Mercury space—he will be fully strong and functional by January 2.</p>

        <p>To complicate matters more, Mercury’s big brother, action planet Mars, is about to retrograde in Leo on December 6, and he will remain in retrograde for more than 11 weeks, until February 23. Red planet Mars goes retrograde every two years, so it’s easy to forget what happened the last time Mars took a long nap. (The last time Mars went retrograde was October 30, 2022, until January 12, 2023, in Gemini.)</p>
<p>When Mars withholds his high-octane energy from each of us, we miss Mars’ power, and to make up for a lack of Mars’ assistance, we have to burn the midnight oil, spending more time, effort, and money of our own to accomplish what would be easier if Mars were direct. You CAN be productive during Mars’ retrograde—it just means this period will take more out of you.</p>
<p>Mars turns direct on February 23, but it will take him until April 30 to rebuild his energy. After ANY planet goes direct, you will notice that life becomes better, but the planet has not yet returned to its ideal, fully functional condition. You will see that Mars will regain energy gradually from February 23 to April 30, improving each day little by little. This is true of every planet as it moves direct out of retrograde.</p>
<blockquote><p>Your prospects will brighten day by day as the only full moon in Gemini this year shines upon you on December 15.</p></blockquote>

        <p>On the heels of Mars’ retrograde, Venus will go retrograde March 1 until April 12, and it will take until May 16 for her to be back to full strength. Venus is tied to love, beauty, luxury, and your good looks, but this planet is also tied to money and profits. While Venus is retrograde, it’s best not to make any business decisions and to avoid spending on expensive dermatology treatments like Botox and fillers (for you too, men)—you might not like the results. Profits may be lower than you expect if you launch an important product or new business when Venus is retrograde.</p>
<p>Venus retrograde overlaps with your ruler Mercury in retrograde AGAIN from March 14 to April 7, partly in your career sector while he’s in your tenth house of prestigious career advancement, and partly in your friendship sector (when old friends come back into your life).</p>
<p>As you see from this long discussion, it’s best not to make life-changing or landmark decisions until mid-May. You are not likely to have all the information you need to make an informed decision. If you must move forward with a business choice, it will be important to do a thorough background check and ask for references, even if you feel you don’t need them. If you want to leave your agent, business partner, or your romantic partner, it might be best to wait a little and give the relationship one more chance if you feel there is still potential to make improvements.</p>
<p>Gemini who were born plus or minus five days from May 30 will feel this new moon of December 1 the most. The same is true if you have Gemini rising or your natal moon in Gemini, plus or minus five degrees of 10 degrees. Also, take a look at your natal chart—do you have any planets at 10 degrees Gemini, Libra, Aquarius, Aries, Leo, or Sagittarius, plus or minus five degrees? If you do, you will feel this new moon’s message strongly too, and that planet will be lit up.</p>

        <p>Jupiter is still touring Gemini, bringing opportunity to you until June 9, and that is a big plus. If you feel Jupiter has not been helping you with benefic opportunities and good fortune, it may be because Jupiter went retrograde on October 9, but he will go direct on February 4. Jupiter will keep getting stronger, and by April 28 he will be in great shape—about the same time Mars will regain his strength, too. Life is going to be much better for you with each passing week and month, something you will start to notice by February, and even more so by May.</p>
<p>Your big moment of the month will be December 15 when the full moon will be in Gemini, 24 degrees, and Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, will be in a wide conjunction to the moon (but still within significance, 8 degrees apart). This full moon will mark a happy moment for everyone, but doubly so for you. Saturn will be in hard angle to both the transiting Sun and full moon, suggesting that if you take an important new assignment, you will work very hard, but it appears to be worth taking on the challenge. You may also travel within five days of December 15, and you will enjoy this trip to the fullest (thanks to Jupiter’s proximity).</p>
<p>Mercury will be the most prominent planet at the time of the December 15 full moon, made more so by the turn of Mercury direct on the same day. Mars will notice Mercury and send his greetings, making this full moon a good time to travel and to work on communications assignments (those include advertising, marketing, and PR assignments, along with writing manuscripts, screenwriting, voiceovers, and more).</p>
<p>Even though Mars is weak this month, he will tour Leo, so it appears you will be very busy with this communications project—writing, editing, researching, fact checking, or doing public speaking or teaching. Mars will stay in your third house all month—which also increases the likelihood of travel—and will leave January 6. You may be spending more money than usual in January through mid-April, as Mars will be going back and forth in Cancer and your second house of earned income. Mars always burns a hole in your pocket.</p>

        <p>You are known to be talented in communications, so don’t think that January 6 means you won’t be working on big assignments anymore. Newly strong and vibrant, Mars will be back in Leo from April 17 to June 17, a time when a flurry of tasks will show up for you.</p>
<p>By the new moon on December 30 in Capricorn, 10 degrees, you will be motivated to close your ledgers on 2024, but not before you have paid everyone you can think of on your list. You may be preparing to send your accountant your receipts and a list of income and expenses so you can get the jump on your tax return as quickly as possible in the New Year.</p>
<p>If you need a mortgage or have put in a claim for an insurance payout (as two examples of many possibilities), the December 30 new moon will give you a reason to move forward and file that application. This new moon is quite sublime—it features Saturn in the lead, so we have to look at the conversations Saturn is having with other planets. Lo and behold, Saturn in Pisces will be in exquisite relationship to the new moon and Sun in Capricorn.</p>
<p>Be careful not to make mathematical mistakes—one or two errors might create doubt in the institution’s administrator who you are petitioning concerning your credit worthiness. Send in your request for money after December 30. This same new moon is an ideal time to make a will or do estate planning to protect your family in the future—doing so will be comforting. If you don’t have a financial advisor, ask family and friends for names, and choose one to consult with to help you build wealth and lower debt.</p>

        <p>With this new moon so beautifully conversant with Saturn in your house of career, your outlook for making good money in the weeks and months ahead is excellent. The caveat is that you must show your interest and take action. Nothing in astrology works by itself—you have to partner with the universe at the right time. That right time, when your first initiation should take place, is shortly after the new moon December 30. Then follow up in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>There’s more information! On December 24 a rare aspect involving Saturn in Pisces and Jupiter in Gemini will occur, suggesting you will reflect on changes you may want to make in your approach to career progress. You will eliminate unproductive habits and set up new methods to reach professional goals.</p>
<p>Christmas Day, December 25, is also the day Chanukah falls this year, which is unusual. The transiting moon will be in Scorpio, a sign that suggests you will enjoy a private, peaceful, and emotionally warm holiday.</p>
<p>On New Year’s Eve the transiting moon will be in Capricorn, and Mars and Pluto will be having a tiff offstage that will culminate by January 3. Pluto is asking you to eliminate what you no longer need and strip things down to the essentials (and some fun things too) so that you can enjoy what you have without the clutter.</p>
<p>Pluto will also have you reassessing a close relationship. As said earlier, take your time, and if anyone seems pushy or aggressive toward you, you may be required to stand your ground. This aspect is slow moving, so you might feel it throughout December, but taking time to reflect on how to address the situation is ultimately worthy of your time and attention.</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You will have a particularly busy month, so it seems you’ll be carrying a checklist of tasks with you, lest you forget one. This is all due to Mars, now in Leo, energizing your fast-moving third house of communication and quick, short travel. (Mars had been in Cancer since early September, a time of high spending and many expenses, but finally moved to Leo last month on November 3, so your expenses have become much more manageable with fewer surprises in December.)</p>
<p>Your ruler Mercury went retrograde last month on November 25, and he will continue to retrograde until December 15. Mercury will reach full functionality and power by January 2. This means you will need to be mindful and present in all your actions, and make sure you don’t leave any items behind, especially while you are in transit.</p>
<p>You would be wise to delay your most important decisions until after the holidays are over. Due to all three of the “personal” planets moving into retrograde in the coming weeks and months (namely, Mercury, Mars, and Venus), it would be best to hold off on vital decisions until May, when all three planets will become stronger and in a better position to shower you with benefic rays and bring interesting opportunities to you.</p>
<p>In May 2024, Jupiter entered Gemini for the first time in 12 years, and he will remain there until June 9, 2025. If you feel Jupiter has not been working hard enough for you, it’s because he has been in weak retrograde orbit since October 9, to go direct on February 4. Each day after February 4, Jupiter will be stronger and more benefic for you, and by May he will be in top condition. All signals are clear—the best time to act on big initiatives will be in May and June.</p>

        <p>Right after the new moon on December 1 in Sagittarius and your partnership and marriage sector, you may consider making a fateful decision about a romantic or business partner. You might be getting ready to be engaged or married, and you may plan to announce your happy news when family has gathered for the holidays at the end of December. If your heart is set on doing so, at least Mercury will be out of retrograde by December 15, which is good. However, Mars will be retrograde, so it might be better to wait until Mars goes direct. The problem there is that the planet of love and affection, Venus, will retrograde the minute Mars goes direct. The choice is yours.</p>
<p>If the choice about a partner or collaborator is not personal but rather professional, the same advice holds—wait until January to hire the collaborator, partner, or expert to help you get ahead. Seal the relationship with a contract. (Even marriage requires a legal contract.) Jupiter will partner with the new moon and Sun on December 1, adding a touch of good fortune and optimism to the steps you are about to take, whether they are now or months from now. Mercury and Jupiter will both be predominant planets at this time, and although Mercury will be weak at the start of December, things will noticeably improve by January 2.</p>
<p>December 15 brings a full moon in Gemini. Benefic Jupiter will orbit close to the full moon, and Mercury will go direct on this same date. At long last, your prospects will brighten day by day after mid-month. With this being the only full moon of the year in Gemini, you will begin to see your identity and future potential in a new light, along with a better understanding of your talents and capabilities and how they can be further developed. Your standing in your community may change and grow larger now too, and along with all these developments, you may decide to do something to refresh—or completely change—your appearance, now or later. Travel is also a big possibility within four days of December 15.</p>
<p>As the month (and the year) is about to come to a close, the new moon in Capricorn on December 30 will motivate you to close your books on 2024, but before you do, you will make sure to pay those you owe. Wiping the slate clean to start the New Year fresh will be your admirable aim, and you may be able to complete that goal by month’s end.</p>

        <p>The new moon in Capricorn on December 30 will light your solar eighth house of other people’s money. At this point, good-fortune Jupiter will partner with Mercury, so it’s possible you may receive a bonus or sum of cash for another reason. Your growing stature in your career is very possibly the source of those funds, for Saturn, the Sun, and the new moon will be in friendly sync.</p>
<p>The fact that Neptune, the ruler of your prestigious tenth house of career achievement, will turn direct on December 7, after having been retrograde since July 2, is great news. Neptune will give you a big boost to your career—and despite Mars’ retrograde, professional talks and progress will move more quickly from now on.</p>
<p>Let’s backtrack a little to December 19, one of the most romantic days of the month, and possibly the best romantic evening of the last quarter of the year. Venus in divine-for-you air-sign Aquarius will be in ideal angle to Jupiter in Gemini, sure to bring an enchanting day for love. The transiting moon will be in Leo, supporting this day with a touch of luxury and sparkle.</p>
