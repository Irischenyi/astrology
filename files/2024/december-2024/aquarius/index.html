        <p>You have one of the best forecasts for holiday fun this month. It should be everything you want it to be, filled with events, friends, family, and warmth, sprinkled with several possible romantic evenings that will seem like they came directly from the silver screen. Give yourself over to the holiday completely, dear Aquarius. I want you to thoroughly enjoy this magical month to the hilt.</p>
<p>December starts out with a new moon on November 30 or December 1, depending on your time zone. This new moon is in compatible Sagittarius, 10 degrees, and is gleaming in your eleventh house of hopes and wishes. It’s a month to dream big because this new moon, being supported by the action planet Mars, suggests that you start to take your dreams seriously—and to choose one to work on this month, even if the steps are small, for in astrology timing is everything.</p>
<p>When a new moon appears in the eleventh house, as you have now, you are likely to be invited to several gatherings. Sagittarius, the place of the new moon and Sun, is an international sign, so you may be meeting people from different cultures and backgrounds, and if you do, those guests will fascinate you. One of the gatherings you attend may be a charity fund-raiser. Mars will be in an outstandingly friendly position during the first half of the month, so you won’t have to socialize alone. If you want your spouse to come with you, it looks like you won’t have to persuade—your partner will gleefully agree.</p>
<p>The only fly in the oatmeal will be that Saturn will be in Pisces in hard position to the new moon, and that suggests you will be very conscious of how much you will be spending as Saturn is in your income and saving sector. (Anyone with Saturn in their second house of money is more cost conscious, although many people with Saturn in this placement in their chart manage to accumulate money by being frugal. Some people make it game to see how much they can put in savings each month.)</p>

        <p>You can still have fun at holiday time without wiping out your checking account balances. It might take a little research into restaurant menus and costs, finding evening clothes you could rent, not buy, or instead wear something you already have and love and refresh their look with new accessories.</p>
<p>Saturn has been in Pisces since March 7, 2023, and will stay until February 13, 2026, a total of 35 months, so you a have completed about 21 months and only have 14 to go. You can see the finish line ahead, and when you complete this cosmic course in finances, you will not be troubled by Saturn in this part of your chart again for many decades from now (specifically, April 2052).</p>
<p>Now I have to tell you about two important retrogrades. The first one is little mischievous Mercury who goes retrograde for three and a half weeks and does so three times a year. This time Mercury started to retrograde last month on November 25 and will go direct on December 15. Mercury will do a backward slide in Sagittarius in your friendship sector (eleventh house), so part of this trend might be enjoyable for you—you are likely to run into old friends you’ve not seen in a long time, and catching up will be fun.</p>
<blockquote><p>Other zodiac signs may need time to ease into the holiday spirit, but not you—you are ready. Friends want to see you and reconnect, and you are eager to see them.</p></blockquote>

        <p>However, the delays in holiday shopping and shipping won’t be fun. You MUST shop and ship early or risk not having the package delivered in time. There will be weather delays, strikes, and a myriad of other problems, not the least of which is you putting the wrong address or zip code on the shipment. Double-check everything you do.</p>
<p>On top of this, Mercury’s brother Mars is also going retrograde, from December 6 to February 23, which represents just over 11 weeks. Mars is the action planet, but when he is asleep, it is hard to push projects forward. It would be the wrong time to open a business or debut a new product. Retrograde periods are time to look back, not forward. They are a time to decide how projects and relationships have proceeded so far over the past year or two (regarding both business and personal, committed relationships). After you reflect, you may want to make tweaks and corrections.</p>
<p>Mars will retrograde in Leo from December 6 to January 6, and then he will back into Cancer. While in Leo, you might waffle about how you feel about a partner in love (such as a spouse or steady sweetheart) or a business associate (partner, agent, manager, publicist, lawyer, or accountant, as some examples—professionals you hire to help you).</p>
<p>It will be particularly difficult to make progress in business, for clients will hesitate and have a hard time making up their mind. Mars teaches us all how to compete well, but when he is missing, we have to spend more time, money, and energy to be productive.</p>

        <p>No planet instantly turns back to full power the day it goes direct. (Actually that’s one of the worst time for any planet for at that point, the planet is working on getting its bearings.) Mercury won’t be back to full power until January 2, and Mars will take until April 30.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to another big aspect this month.</p>
<p>Circle the date of the full moon, December 15, which will fall in fellow air-sign Gemini and will light your fifth house of true love and romance. This part of your chart covers your sweetheart and also pregnancy, children, and creativity. If you are single, you could have a fateful meeting, so if you are invited to a party, by all means go! A full moon in Gemini would bubble up all kinds of interesting conversations among guests on topics like vital current events, which is just what you love—intellectual engagement. You’d be surrounded with many smart, aware, hip people who are go-getters, and they are the types that don’t let any grass grow under their feet. Inspirational!</p>
<p>If you are already dating someone seriously or are married, this full moon could go in one of two ways, and you might need to make a decision about the future of your romantic relationship.</p>
<p>If you have not been happy and have had doubts for some time, you will need to decide what to do. You may say something to your partner now or wait until after the holidays. Full moons bring closure; they cleanse conditions. The universe doesn’t like to see an unproductive, “stuck” relationship, so it sends a full moon to almost force you to decide whether to stay and see a couples therapist or leave without regret.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, if you are in love, very happy, and are sure this person is “the one,” you could become betrothed and positively giddy with excitement. Full moons, as you know, heighten emotions. This full moon falls over a weekend, and if you do have exciting news, the open weekend will allow you to take full advantage of this happy time.</p>
<p>I am excited to see that Jupiter, the planet of gifts, luck, and happiness will appear in conjunction (although wide) to this December 15 full moon (Jupiter is within a space of 8 degrees to the full moon, which is close enough to be significant and influential). Jupiter brings good luck, growth, happiness, and financial reward—and Jupiter has also been associated with miracles.</p>
<p>If you are in the process of a divorce, you may be shaking your head, saying there is no way romance is happening on this full moon. In this case, if you have children, you will make a custody agreement.</p>
<p>If you hope to have children, you may be having your eggs frozen. Alternatively, you may find out you are pregnant on this full moon and may be thrilled to hear the news. If that would not be good news, then be very careful this month, starting from the very beginning, as Jupiter in your fifth house would make pregnancy easier than usual.</p>

        <p>Finally, if you are working on a major creative project, this full moon could mark the end of the project, and you may be putting the finishing touches on it as you get ready to show it to the world. It is a very good time for you to focus on an artistic project, for it is likely to be well received.</p>
<p>If your birthday falls on, or within five days of, February 12, or you have your natal moon in Aquarius at 24 degrees, plus or minus five degrees, you will find this full moon to be a peach. The same is true if you have Aquarius rising 24 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. Also, look to see if you have a natal planet in Aquarius, Gemini, Libra, Aries, Leo, or Sagittarius at 24 degrees (same degree parameters), for that planet will receive positive vibrations and treat you very well.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to a rare aspects of two big outer planets—Jupiter will challenge (square) Saturn. Most rare aspects like this one come by three times within a year or two as the planets go back and forth in retrograde. This is the way they create transformational change. The first time we had this aspect was earlier this year on August 19, 2024. We will get it a second time this month on December 24, and then not again until June 15, 2025. The next time Jupiter and Saturn will be in this type of aspect, when they will both be in different signs and houses, will be April 2035.</p>
<p>This month, on December 24, you might realign how you appropriate funds to spend on your children, on vacations, or on other leisure activity. It’s simply a time to rethink your priorities, especially since Saturn is holding down your income temporarily (as discussed earlier, so tight cash flow will clear up in 14 months).</p>

        <p>Christmas Day, which is also the start of Chanukah this year, December 25, will bring the transiting moon to Scorpio, a spiritual, emotional sign that should bring you into the true spirit of the holiday. It should be what you hoped it would be—warm, intimate and loving.</p>
<p>It’s hard to believe that even more aspects are coming on this busy month—but it is true. Here is the news:</p>
<p>We have a new moon due in Capricorn on December 30 at 10 degrees, and it will light your twelfth house of privacy. After a very busy month of being surrounded by many people, you will crave some quiet alone time. Holidays can be strenuous. Your twelfth house is being emphasized, so if you need surgery, you might simply schedule it in early January shortly after this new moon arrives .</p>
<p>This is an excellent new moon because Saturn is taking the lead here, and by a wonderful coincidence, instead of showing his usual tough side, Saturn will be kind and ultra-supportive. That means whatever you are putting in place at that time will turn out to be a good decision and feel satisfying to you. It will give you a sense of comfort, stability, and a feeling of safety and security—you will have no need to change that decision, not any time to soon—possibly never.</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Other zodiac signs may need time to ease into the holiday spirit, but not you—you are ready. Friends want to see you and reconnect, and you are eager to see them. Saturn, the teacher planet that uses tough love to impart its wisdom, is currently in your financial second house, so you won’t be in the mood to spend freely. That’s OK—you need not plan an expensive holiday season to enjoy it.</p>
<p>You have been hosting Saturn in your second house of earned income and savings since early March 2023, and you are more than halfway through Saturn’s tutoring process. Money will come in more easily after Saturn leaves this position in February 2026, but in the meantime, you will be learning tips and tricks from Saturn to get more from the money you have now, for that’s the point of Saturn’s visit.</p>
<p>After you are finished with Saturn’s financial cosmic MBA in February 2026, Saturn will not be back to this part of your chart until April 2052. As you see, Saturn’s visits are rare. As your tutor, Saturn has to be sure all he teaches you is vivid enough to carry you forward nearly three decades. Astrologers generally feel that the first time you experience a visit from Saturn in any part of your chart (usually before you turn 29) is the hardest experience because, theoretically, you would have much to learn. Subsequent visits of Saturn are easier, since you already will have much of Saturn’s wisdom under your belt.</p>
<p>With Saturn in Pisces since March 2023, you have learned how to find bargains and negotiate with sophistication. You’ve been cutting waste to keeping more of the money you have earned. Finding a fun way to ring in the New Year with friends will be easy—remember it matters not where you go or how much you spend but who you are with.</p>

        <p>Now turning to your love life, Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, is in your true romance sector, so if you have not yet found your one and only sweetheart/spouse, accept invitations to all holiday parties. You stand an excellent chance of finding a fascinating person you would like to know better.</p>
<p>Venus will boost your charm and magnetism by being in Aquarius throughout the holiday season from December 7 until January 2. Your personality will sparkle brightly at any gathering. If you are attached, your partner will gladly accompany you to events—Mars in your opposite sign of Leo will make it so. With Mars in gorgeous angle to the new moon of December 1, you have every reason to feel this holiday season will be a standout.</p>
<p>The full moon on December 15 in Gemini could be exquisitely romantic, as it will light your fifth house of true love. Jupiter will orbit close to that full moon in fellow air-sign Gemini, suggesting you might have a breathtaking romantic episode within five days after the date it appears. Neptune will be in hard angle, so don’t get carried away with the excitement and rush of love (it will be hard not to!)—if smitten, let the relationship grow at a leisurely pace.</p>
<p>If you have not been happy in your relationship, this full moon may almost force you to make a plan. Will you try to fix the relationship, possibly with the help of a couple’s therapist? Or will you walk away without regret? With Jupiter so close to the moon, if you have to break up, it would likely be done amicably.</p>
<p>Other possible ways the full moon might affect you could involve a pregnancy, birth of a new baby, a decision to help a child you have now in some positive way, or to finish up a beloved creative project.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind that Mercury will be retrograde until this full moon, December 15, having initially gone retrograde last month on November 25.</p>
<p>On top of Mercury’s retrograde, his big brother Mars, the action planet, will go retrograde too, beginning December 6, and will remain retrograde until February 23—just over a whopping 11 weeks. The pace of life will slow down, and business deals will be harder to accomplish. Clients will hesitate to commit—don’t pressure anyone to move forward. It will be to the benefit of you and your client(s) to go slowly. Socializing with friends and family is the ideal way to spend December while you wait for cosmic storms to blow over.</p>
<p>Put a star on December 19 when Venus and Jupiter will be in ideal communication—both planets in air signs (Gemini and Aquarius) is tailor-made for you. This date falls on a Thursday, but you’ll still be able to enjoy the sweetness of these two planets over the weekend of December 20-22.</p>
<p>You will have a very busy month, so by the time you get closer to the last week of December and the new moon of December 30, you will want to rest and draw close to family and those you hold most dear. You have so much to look forward to in 2025, with plenty of opportunity for sweet romance that will run all the way to early July. Rest up by spending a festive dinner with your romantic partner or a friend to welcome in the New Year. You have so much to be thankful for in life, and more blessings are to come soon in 2025.</p>
