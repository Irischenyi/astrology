        <p>People you know are rushing around, frantic to prepare for the holidays, but your chart shows that you’re remaining calm and in a reflective mood as you arrange your plans. The new moon in Sagittarius, 10 degrees, on November 30 or December 1 (depending on your time zone) is currently lighting your twelfth house, a private and healing part of your chart.</p>
<p>Your birthday is coming, as is the New Year, so you might be making a certain New Year’s resolution with a spirit of determination. As a result of the new moon on December 1, you may decide you need to be free of a habit that is harming your health. You might seek the help of a therapist now, and if you do, your timing would be excellent. This would be the most ideal point in the year to seek professional help because this new moon will delve deeply into your subconscious. The new moon on December 1 will sharpen your intuition, so listen to that small voice within you.</p>
<p>Good-fortune Jupiter will partner with this new moon and give you a sense of optimism and energy to see your goal through to the finish line no matter how long it takes. In astrology, it matters when you begin because that moment is the “birth,” the initiation. Start in the first week of December (even if you can only take baby steps), and you will be on your way.</p>
<p>Action Mars will send the December 1 new moon a friendly, strong beam from your financial eighth house, so if you are concerned about receiving health care treatment, investigate your insurance coverage—it seems you will have the money you need, possibly covered by your insurance or a generous bonus or commission you could earn at work.</p>

        <p>Let’s focus on Mars for a moment—Mars is starting one of his fairly infrequent retrogrades this month. (Mars only goes retrograde every two years for eight to 11 weeks.) This time Mars will begin to retrograde in Leo and your financial eighth house of other people’s money, so this could slow down payments to you, or it might delay your ability to pay other people or institutions in full (such as credit card companies or the government for taxes). Mars will start to retrograde on December 6 and will turn direct on February 23, 2025, more than 11 weeks later.</p>
<p>When Mars retrogrades, it is not a favorable time to begin new ventures, but it is a useful period to look back and learn from past decisions and actions. For example, if you were planning to start your business, don’t open the doors of your company until mid-May.</p>
<p>Once a planet goes direct after languishing in retrograde, it does not jump back to life instantly. Just like a person awakening after a long sleep, the planet is groggy and needs time (and a little coffee) to build up to full strength and alertness again, and Mars will accomplish that feat by April 30, 2025.</p>
<blockquote><p>When you think about your wishes this month, think big and choose one that’s close to your heart. You will be able to build greater security and stability.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Mars is the natural ruler of Aries and your home and family sector (fourth house), so as Mars (currently) in Leo and your eighth money house sends beams to the November 1 new moon and the Sun, you might see financial delays crop up at home or regarding cash you seem to need (possibly for a mortgage or from insurance connected to your house or other property, or for the care of a family member).</p>
<p>If you are looking at spaces because you want to move into a new place to live or buy a vacation home, you might not find your dream apartment, house, or vacation property until the very end of March at the friendly new moon solar eclipse in Aries on March 29, 2025. Or you could see other changes in regard to your home or family. For example, you might make a final decision about how best to help an elderly parent by finding them comfortable living arrangements.</p>
<p>You’ve had a series of eclipses in Aries and Libra, and the ones in Aries touched your home life while the ones in Libra affected your career. Eclipses can be very dramatic, and you may feel that you were uprooted professionally or domestically—or in both areas of life.</p>

        <p>One or more of the following dates may resonate strongly with you:</p>
<p>Last year you had a solar eclipse on April 19, 2023, in Aries (accenting your home) and a solar eclipse in Libra (emphasizing your career) on October 14, 2023.</p>
<p>You’ve had three eclipses in the same family of signs this year: A lunar eclipse on March 25 in Libra (which accented your career), a solar eclipse on April 8 in Aries (which highlighted your home), and a solar eclipse in Libra on October 2 (which emphasized your career).</p>
<p>You only have one eclipse left in the Aries-Libra family of signs, and then none for nine years. I think that the last one could be the most important as it will help you solve your home and family plans—the solar eclipse in Aries on March 29, 2025.</p>
<p>The last eclipse in a series of eclipses usually provides closure. That eclipse is a new moon, which marks an opportunity and the opening of a major new life experience, so let’s see what happens in the coming months.</p>
<p>I should also mention that Mercury is currently retrograde, having started to move backward on November 25, and will continue to do so until December 15. It will take Mercury until January 2, 2025, to regain all his strength.</p>

        <p>That timing may be fine with you—the world will slow down during this festive holiday season. Hold off on signing any paperwork until January 2, if possible, but if you cannot wait, choose December 19 when Venus will make a beautiful connection with Jupiter—this will be a truly great day for you.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to the full moon on December 15, which will appear in your sixth house of work assignments. You seem to be close to finishing up a project at work or at home.</p>
<p>Good-fortune Jupiter will ride close to the full moon—wide, within 8 degrees, but still within the area of significance. Having Jupiter near this full moon will make all the difference because Jupiter brings reward, growth, and often prosperity to any area he touches.</p>
<p>It may be that the work project you will be finishing up will be well received by the client or management and will add a jewel to your crown. A full moon is operative for five days, so watch from December 15 to December 20 to see how this will play out. It looks like this assignment could put you in line for bigger and better professional opportunities by mid-April thanks to the stellar performance you are putting in now.</p>
<p>This same house where this full moon will fall is also your health sector, and more specifically, the place in your chart that reflects the steps you take to stay healthy. As two possible examples, of an unlimited number, you might finish up a physical therapy program (or other protocol), or on this full moon, you could receive the results of a series of routine tests and screenings.</p>

        <p>Mercury will be the leader of the December 15 full moon, and happily, I see that Mercury will be very friendly to the three planets that it will be communicating with—Mercury will be in heavenly angle to Mars, Pluto, and Venus. I feel this news should be positive, and even if the tests show a concern (I am not at all saying that these tests will), the fact that Mercury will be so well connected indicates that your doctor would likely have a wise and effective course of treatment for you. This full moon will also receive blessings from Jupiter—keep in mind that Jupiter is not only the good fortune planet, but he is also the planet associated with miracles.</p>
<p>As for romance, Venus has been in Capricorn since November, and as you start December, you will still have until December 7 to enjoy having Venus favor your sign. You will sparkle, and if you are buying anything for yourself as you go gift shopping, that would be a marvelous idea. What you find for yourself in early December will likely be madly flattering.</p>
<p>On December 2 Venus and surprise-a-minute Uranus in Taurus will be in touch, making for an enchanting day for romance.</p>
<p>Venus will move to Aquarius on December 7, and in that sign, Venus will fill your solar second house of earned income. Money might come to you in ways outside of your work, such as through a generous gift from your family. Venus will stay in Aquarius from December 7 until January 2.</p>

        <p>Your tenth house of prestigious career advancement will be tied to Venus in your earnings sector. Furthermore, because you have Taurus on the midheaven of your solar chart, the placement of Venus in your second financial house indicates that you might receive a raise or bonus for work well done. In general, your outlook for making money (or being given cash) is solid this month.</p>
<p>There is one date I would like you to circle on your calendar—December 19. On this day, Jupiter in Gemini and your work-a-day project house will be in fine angle to Venus in Aquarius and your earned income sector (second house). This will be a perfect time to advance your career and potentially generate good money for yourself as well. Pitch a client, have an interview, or take a longtime associate to lunch in appreciation of their past support and to stir up new business together.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to a very rare aspect that is coming up on December 24. This is when Saturn in Pisces and Jupiter in Gemini and your work-a-day house will square (challenge) each other. Saturn is your ruler, so it is weighted more heavily in importance in your chart than for people of other zodiac signs. Saturn is currently in your communications sector, and as said, Jupiter is in your work-a-day zone (the reason so much business is flowing in the door). It might be time to review your sources, methods, and the tools you use to accomplish your projects.</p>
<p>When thinking about Jupiter in hard aspect to Saturn and the places in your chart where you have these planets, I can suggest some ways to rethink your job. Would using a new type of software make you more efficient? Can you find a way to harness A.I. to improve your workflow? What research do you rely on? Would a different source of data be more accurate for you to pull from? These are the types of questions that come up when Jupiter and Saturn challenge one another.</p>

        <p>Now let’s talk about Christmas Day and Chanukah (both falling on December 25), which should turn out to be joyous for you. The transiting moon will be in Scorpio, a sign that blends perfectly with yours. It will light up your eleventh house of friendship, a sector that also covers your deepest hopes and wishes. This day should make you feel wrapped in a cocoon of love by your friends and family, and you may realize how very lucky you are to be surrounded by people who love you so dearly.</p>
<p>Your biggest day of the month will come on December 30 when the new moon in Capricorn will appear at 10 degrees. This new moon is your cosmic gift given to you for your birthday from a loving universe. Saturn, your ruler, will take a big role at this particular new moon, acting as the most prominent planet.</p>
<p>Happily, Saturn will still be in Pisces and your communication sector and will send a perfect beam to the December 30 new moon in your first house of personality and identity. This is incredibly significant because it means you have a golden opportunity to build the financial security you want.</p>
<p>The closer your birthday falls to December 30, the more dramatically you will feel this new moon. The same is true if you have Capricorn rising or your natal moon is in Capricorn, 10 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. If you have a natal plant at 10 degrees Capricorn, Taurus, Virgo, Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces, plus or minus five degrees, that planet will go the distance to help you.</p>

        <p>When you think about your wishes at this new moon, think big and pick one that’s close to your heart. The goal you choose to put in place in the days that follow this new moon will have gravitas and long-term importance for you. Thanks to Saturn’s support at this time, you will be able to build greater security and stability, which will add to your confidence and comfort. This new moon is special—just like you.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>As you begin the month, you may be thinking about gradually changing your habits to improve your short -and long-term health. If you could use some help, this is the time to reach out to a professional because the December 1 new moon in Sagittarius will stimulate your subconscious mind and allow you to accomplish goals that might have proved daunting in the past.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you appear to be working on personal financial planning, and you seem to have been spending more than usual on money management ever since Mars entered Leo and your shared resources sector last month on November 3. Your current outflow is heavy now, but it should ease next month once you get past January 6. I will explain why.</p>
<p>Mars will go retrograde this month on December 6 until February 23, 2025. However, on January 6 Mars will have skated backward so far that he will leave Leo and move into Cancer for a long time, until April 17.</p>

        <p>Looking ahead, Mars will be back to Leo and this same financial part of your chart from April 17 to June 17, hence, your spending will increase again. To have this much emphasis on money management suggests that something big may be going on in your chart. You may be having quite a lifestyle change, and those periods are always expensive.</p>
<p>I looked deeper, and it seems that you are ready to put a down payment on a house or condo or to upgrade your space with a renovation and some new furniture for your décor. Alternatively, you may need to help a family member financially to ensure their care. Mars is the natural ruler of your solar fourth house of family, which is the reason your spending seems to point to your home.</p>
<p>The full moon in Gemini on December 15 (plus five days) seems to bring a happy development as you finish a large professional or personal project. If you need to hire someone, such as an assistant or, at home, a nanny or housekeeper, it would be best to wait a few days before you announce your chosen candidate. Mercury has been retrograde since November 25 and will go direct on December 15.</p>
<p>Any planet is unstable on the day it turns direct, so leave a space of days before you act. Plan to make an initiation on December 19—a great day for you on so many levels. If you can wait longer, take action on or after January 2, the day Mercury will be back to top energy and efficiency.</p>

        <p>Keep your health strong leading up to the year-end holidays. This full moon on December 15, although likely to offer happy news because it falls close to Jupiter, could bring a cold or flu if you overdo it. December is a strenuous month for everyone, so ask your doctor’s advice about whether you need certain meds or vitamins. If it’s time for you to get a flu shot or updated COVID vaccine, do it, especially if your doctor recommends it. Starting December 21, it will be Capricorn’s time, and you will want to be healthy to enjoy the holidays to the fullest.</p>
<p>On December 24, you may be in a thoughtful mode because Jupiter will be in hard angle to Saturn, your ruler. Jupiter, the planet of good fortune, never afflicts, so this is a helpful aspect to make changes and break old, unproductive habits. You will be able to come up with new methods to fulfill your commitments, and at work you can learn to negotiate more skillfully. You may want to pick up a few self-improvement books for ideas about how to accomplish that.</p>
<p>As mentioned, your ruler Saturn will be in a challenging square angle to Jupiter on December 24, indicating that you are ready to shake things up and try new methods at work, at home, and at the office. Jupiter and Saturn rarely get into conversation (the last time was in 2016, and they were in different signs then), so you have an opportunity to rethink the way you approach things, including how you handle money (Jupiter is speaking here). You could find, much to your surprise, that this exercise will be worthwhile, helping you to increase your productivity and profits.</p>

        <p>Christmas Day will bring the transiting moon to Scorpio and your eleventh house of pure joy—a wonderful omen for a fun-filled holiday that’s brimming with cheer.</p>
<p>December 30 brings you the major moment of the month—the new moon in Capricorn—which is your cosmic gift certificate to use any way you please. You only get a new moon like this once a year, so decide which area of your life you’d like to improve with the help of a loving universe.</p>
<p>This new moon in Capricorn suggests that you might even be ready to upgrade your appearance—talk to your stylist (male Capricorn’s, too). You are growing and changing, and you might feel you are ready to elevate your look with some new clothes. This new moon could also mark developments in a close relationship.</p>
<p>Plan to ring in the New Year gently, romantically, and privately. You might not want to splurge on going out—you’ve got plans for bigger and better things to spend on in coming months. A New Year is on the way, and with it, a brand-new chapter will open up for you.</p>
