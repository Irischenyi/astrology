        <p>You tend to love December because it is the season of giving that appeals to your Piscean compassionate, generous nature. Even if a Pisces is strapped for money, he or she will tuck away a small amount of money—$5.00 or $10.00—to send to charity. As Pisces prosper, their contributions grow. The thought of others suffering bruises this sensitive sign, which gives you the impetus to offer support and sustenance.</p>
<p>December appeals to Pisces for another reason. It is a month filled with mystery, spirituality or religion, carols and music, and moments of enchantment. It is the season of imagination, wonder, and make-believe with surprises tossed in like big handfuls of glitter. Love, affection, and warmth from friends and family circle around you like a cozy winter coat.</p>
<p>Although candy canes will be dancing in the heads of your friends, you will still have your mind firmly on your career in early December. Whatever career action you put in motion after the new moon in Sagittarius at 10 degrees on November 30 or December 1 (depending on your time zone), the seeds of those actions will grow huge like “Jack and the Beanstalk’s” beans. You have the first 10 days of the month to do something positive for your career, and if you do, your harvest will grow so high, it may “reach the sky.”</p>
<p>The days that follow a new moon are always extra potent. Energy planet Mars is in Leo and your work-a-day house of assignments (sixth house) and will send a golden beam to the new moon and Sun in Sagittarius in your house of prestigious career advancement. An assignment you do now will likely be well received and create a buzz about your talent. Because Jupiter, associated with money, is the most dominant planet at this new moon, what you do in the first 14 days might translate into money for you.</p>

        <p>Jupiter, the good fortune planet, is approximately 180 degrees away from the new moon and thereby is partnering with the Sun and new moon. Jupiter is the best partner to have.</p>
<p>Now at the same time as the new moon in Sagittarius December 1, Saturn will be tightly square the moon and Sun. The Sun has rulership over your work assignments, so indeed, you will be working extremely hard. Saturn will also challenge (square) the moon, an that could bring some speed bumps on the road to a creative project.</p>
<p>The moon is the natural ruler of your solar fifth house, ruling love, so you may hear some complaints from your sweetheart or children (if you have them) about your heavy work schedule and long hours away from home. This is temporary—in December, particularly.</p>
<p>Dear Pisces, right now you have a tiger by the tail, and you must keep focused on your career progress and growing reputation for excellence. Don’t worry about your home and love life—that will normalize soon—mid-month on the full moon December 15, and also in January.</p>
<blockquote><p>Jupiter will orbit close to the full moon December 15, suggesting a warm and happy holiday season with the focus on family awaits you.</p></blockquote>

        <p>A new moon is influential for approximately five and half months. This new moon in Sagittarius will shine in your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement on December 1, 2024, and will then disperse all her energy and defer her power to the full moon in Sagittarius on June 11, 2025. (By the way, that June 11 full moon will be a very fortunate one for your professional life. You are on a roll!)</p>
<p>Now I need to talk about two retrogrades that will be part of the background of December. The first retrograde concerns little Mercury, the planet of communication and travel, which went retrograde November 25 and will go direct this month on December 15. Mercury is going backward in your career house, so you may have faced some frustrating delays in regard to your career. If you are working on a high-profile project, you may have to do some backtracking. Everyone of every sign feels Mercury retrograde in a fairly uniform way, no matter what the person’s sign, so simply go with the flow.</p>
<p>Mercury rules all elements related to commerce—shopping, trading, marketing, sales, and more, so you may have faced delays getting the gifts you wanted to buy. You will have to make it a point to ship early or risk not having your gifts delivered in time.</p>
<p>Overlapping this Mercury retrograde period will be Mercury’s big brother Mars, also due to retrograde. Action planet Mars does not retrograde that often (only every two years), so as you go through the coming weeks, your experience with Mars retrograde may not seem familiar. Action hero Mars will go retrograde on December 6 and stay retrograde until February 23—that’s just over 11 weeks.</p>

        <p>No planet jumps to life instantly upon going direct. Little Mercury will be walking into furniture, and his big brother Mars will be stumbling around the kitchen looking to make coffee right after each of them goes direct. For this reason, make it a point never to jump on the day—or a few days—after a planet goes direct. Those are the planets’ very worst days, when they are the most unstable. A planet has to rebuild its strength.</p>
<p>After little rowdy Mercury goes direct December 15, he will be back to full power on January 2.</p>
<p>Mars will take much longer to regain his strength and normalize. Mars will go direct February 23 but won’t be fully back to robust power until April 30.</p>
<p>With Mercury retrograding in your career sector and Mars backtracking in your work-a-day sector, your work life will feel the brunt of these retrogrades.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more. Mars may be IN your work-a-day sixth house, but Mars RULES your second house of earned income. This suggests payments you expect may be late or stuck in a paperwork maze.</p>
<p>Little “Wrecker Ralph” Mercury is IN your career sector (tenth house), but he RULES your home and family sector (fourth house). This may mean that you will change your mind about a home -or family-related decision you made earlier this year. Mercury also rules your partnerships in love and business, so you may need more time to think about an impending legal commitment you had planned to make.</p>

        <p>The planets that we feel the most when retrograde are the ones that orbit closest to earth—Mercury, Mars, and Venus. You might be thinking, “Well, at least Venus is doing well.” Actually, yes, for now, but right after Mars goes direct on February 23, his cosmic lover Venus will go retrograde on March 1 until April 12 and won’t come up to full strength until May 16.</p>
<p>During Venus retrograde, it is not favorable to get married or give an expensive party or charity fund-raiser. It would be best to avoid buying expensive jewelry, and avoid asking your dermatologist to give you Botox or filler treatments. Don’t schedule a face lift, and avoid doing anything radical to your hair, such as to go from brunette to blonde or to have it cut it dramatically different (this goes for you men, too). Venus protects your looks, and when she is languishing in retrograde, she can’t do much to help you.</p>
<p>As you see, the first part of 2025 will have a very slow start. Retrograde planets are useful because they will coax you to examine past decisions and actions and to make course corrections. You also will be encouraged to see clients and colleagues who have supported you in the past, but not lately, to see if you can work together again.</p>
<p>Mars will retrograde in your assignment sector first (sixth house) during this month from December 6 until January 6. At that time Mars will continue to retrograde backward, straight into Cancer and your fifth house.</p>

        <p>Once in Cancer, you may waffle over a decision you need to make about a person you are dating. Alternatively, you may be indecisive about a move you are about to enact on behalf of one of your children. If you are working on a creative project, you may decide to take it in a new direction.</p>
<p>Mars will continue to skate backward until February 23. Then he will reverse course—keep in mind, Mars will still be weak. Mars will remain in Cancer until he slips back into Leo, from April 17 until June 17. In those two months, mid-April through mid-June, Mars will be moving swiftly (especially after April 30), so you will be very busy and super-productive in regard to work assignments.</p>
<p>As you read earlier in my report, you begin December with your mind squarely on your career.</p>
<p>That will change at the full moon in Gemini, 24 degrees, to fall on December 15, which will be influential for a plus five days. At that time, your attention will turn to your home and family and to developments culminating there. Like at the new moon, good-fortune Jupiter will be close to the moon—this time in conjunction (wide, 8 degrees, but still significant).</p>
<p>That suggests you are making beautiful improvements to your physical home or other property that you may own or rent. Or you may be buying or selling property soon, but please do not do so while Mercury is retrograde—you may regret your purchase. Do the final paperwork in 2025, if possible.</p>

        <p>Neptune, your ruler, will be in hard angle to the full moon December 15 (plus five days). You might have problems with water in your home at this time. If you have already had problems, then you might now find out the source or reason for the initial water-related problem at this full moon.</p>
<p>Don’t close on a house or condo. Also delay signing an estimate for a renovation—some of the facts will be unclear or missing but will become clearer in January. It is not wise to make a financial commitment at this time with Neptune cranking out his fog, and Mercury retrograde will compound the confusion, creating contractual havoc.</p>
<p>Thanks to Jupiter, this area of your life, your home and family, is where you will be very busy, and you will enjoy your new house or apartment if you move, renovate, do repairs, paint, or refresh your décor.</p>
<p>Good-fortune Jupiter made his first visit in 12 years to this, your fourth house of home and family, on May 25, 2024, and is set to stay until June 9, 2025. You still have time to focus on this glittering part of your life.</p>

        <p>Christmas Day and the start of Chanukah will fall on the very same day, December 25, which is rare. On that day, the transiting moon will be in water-sign Scorpio, a spiritual, private sign that blends perfectly with your water-sign Pisces Sun. Scorpio energizes your ninth house of travel, so you may be visiting family or friends at a distance for the holiday.</p>
<p>As an aside, Neptune will go direct this month, which is good news—Neptune is your guardian planet (also called your ruler). That will happen earlier in the month, on December 7, having been retrograde and operating at weak power since July 2.</p>
<p>This change of Neptune will help somewhat, but admittedly with so many small, personal planets (Mercury, Mars, and later, Venus) going out of commission, it’s a time to proceed slowly.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, we have another new moon this month on December 30, this time in Capricorn, 10 degrees. This will change your focus quite a bit—it’s time to party! This new moon will energize your house of friends and community, so you are likely to be out and about, eager to celebrate the New Year. You will have had a lot on your plate in December, so you will simply move your celebration to month’s end and keep the spirit of the season alive and vibrant in you directly into January.</p>

        <p>This new moon will help you see and call friends you’ve not seen in a long time. If you have a constituency of followers, say, if you are a public person, you will be able to re-energize your base. At this new moon, Saturn will be the leading planet, giving us an indication about the way the new moon will affect you.</p>
<p>Lo and behold, Saturn will be in ideal position to help you from his position in Pisces in your first house of personality. The power of “you”—your temperament and style—is what will draw new people to you. In fact, you may make a new friend this month that you will enjoy in the months ahead. Actions that you take after the new moon appears December 30 will have longevity and a sense of importance, so this new person might have an essential role to play in your life. This is all good news. Let’s see how things unfold.</p>
<p>This new moon will give you a double dip of pleasure if your birthday falls on February 28, plus or minus five days. The same is true if you have Pisces rising or your natal moon in Pisces at 10 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. Also, if you have a planet in your birth chart in Pisces, Cancer, Scorpio, Taurus, Virgo, or Capricorn at 10 degrees, plus or minus five degrees, this new moon of December 30 will activate that planet to be quite beneficial for you.</p>
<p>With this golden new moon energizing your social sector, I cannot imagine that you will opt to stay home on New Year’s Eve (not unless you give your own large, or small, party there for friends). With the moon still in Capricorn on December 31, you’ll want to step out to ring in the New Year. You have worked hard, so allow yourself this small indulgence.</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>As the month opens, your career is suddenly going gangbusters. You are in demand, and your latest triumphs may even be written up in the press. You have a rare and exciting professional new moon in your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement on November 30 or December 1 (depending on your time zone). This new moon, very friendly to Mars in Leo in your work assignment sector, will likely open opportunities for new assignments in the weeks ahead, beyond those that come up this month. All new moons have a long tail and can carry you forward five months in regard to the message it brings.</p>
<p>Saturn will be at hard angle to the Sun and new moon, so jobs you have will require hard work and concentration, but the resulting rewards from your work will be evident. You may have to juggle things going on at home at the same time, but if you are organized, you can have your cake and eat it, too. If you need help, you will be able to find qualified help. Lastly, if you take on a new project, the compensation will please you.</p>
<p>Note: I outlined this new moon last month in my November report to you so that you could plan ahead.</p>
<p>I always cover the coming new or full moon if it falls in the first two or three days of the following month or at the very end of the present month (like the new moon later this month on December 30) so that you can plan ahead. Additionally, you can have all of my information in my daily forecast in my “Astrology Zone Horoscopes” app, available on Apple App Store and Google Play. My premium edition ($4.99 a month) gives you approximately 80 words per sign per day, and I always talk about the major aspect of the day. I also remind you of what is happening on social media each day (Instagram, Facebook, Threads, Blue Sky, Discord, and X—search @AstolgoyZone).</p>

        <p>Back to your forecast now.</p>
<p>As you get to the full moon in Gemini on December 15, your larger focus will be on your family and those you hold dear. Jupiter will orbit close to the full moon, suggesting a warm and happy holiday season awaits you.</p>
<p>To see the final result of events of this full moon, we need to look to Mercury, the planet in the lead. As a stroke of luck, active Mercury will be beautifully oriented to Pluto and Venus. Not only will family be important to you, the full moon will generate applause for your professional life, too. Indeed, I see strong indications that December will be your most important month of 2024 to advance your career.</p>
<p>Mercury started to retrograde last month on November 25 and will continue to do so until December 15. This suggests you may have delays or things to re-do, but on the plus side, a client you used to work with may come back into the picture.</p>
<p>Additionally, Mars will also go retrograde, which is more problematic because Mars keeps the pace of life humming along, and Mars will slow business deals as clients will be skittish to commit. Even in your personal life, it will be hard to convince anyone to see your point of view. Things will improve by February 23 when Mars will go direct.</p>

        <p>Yet even after Mars turns direct on February 23, it will take until April 30 for Mars to fully regain his former strength. While you will need to be satisfied with small victories during this period, keep in mind that everyone will be in the same boat, so you won’t lose any competitive edge—things will simply seem frozen in place for a while.</p>
<p>The full moon of December 15 should bring some happy developments on the home and family front. This year you will certainly be able to feel the warmth and closeness of family and friends at this full moon, even though your work life will never be far from your thoughts.</p>
<p>By the time you get to the last week of the month, you might be eager to enjoy romance and fun with friends, too.</p>
<p>The new moon of December 30 will be ideal for you to talk to your friends to plan a fun way to ring in the New Year together. If you are not moving or renovating your home (possible this year or in the coming months), you might want to give a party for friends at home.</p>

        <p>In terms of romance, Venus is about to enter Pisces for the first time in 10 months on January 2, to stay until February 4. This is a wonderful way to enter the New Year. At the same time, Mars will re-enter Cancer on January 6, staying until April 17, 2025, also highlighting love and children.</p>
<p>Mars is Venus’ cosmic lover, so the position of both planets are important to note to enjoy romance. To have both Venus and Mars in compatible water signs is wonderful—by January 25, 2025, they will be in a perfect “trine” (great harmony), so you have a bright outlook for romance in the weeks ahead. You have the right planetary help to engender new love or to create greater closeness in an existing love relationship. This is all wonderful news.</p>
<p>So for now, plan on seeing a group of friends on New Year’s Eve. You have a fun time to look forward to in the coming months, and it could include breathtaking romance.</p>
