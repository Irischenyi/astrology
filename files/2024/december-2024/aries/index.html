        <p>You made it through the eclipses in September, a demanding October, and a scrambled November. I promise, December will be easier—the best month so far. You may wonder, how can that be? December is a hustle-bustle month for everyone, with the pressure to get ready for the year-end holidays, but yet, the aspects are being a little gentler.</p>
<p>I will admit we all will be dealing with the retrogrades I reported about over the past few months. The planet of commerce, communication, and contracts—Mercury—is still fast asleep, and left to cope without him, we all miss his help in everyday matters. Mercury began to retrograde in Sagittarius on November 25 and will continue to retrograde until December 15. I wrote that there could be transportation delays and possibly labor strikes, and already air traffic is slowing down due to lack of personnel, air traffic controllers are threatening a strike in Paris, France, and postal workers in Canada are on strike.</p>
<p>All I can say is say is that the handwriting is on the wall—we all have to shop and ship packages early because there will be delays. Inventory will run low, too. I noticed Black Friday has been going on nearly all month, partly because Thanksgiving in the US falls very late this year (a week later than usual). Still, I bet someone highly placed at Amazon and other retail shops read up on astrology.</p>
<p>I have followed my own advice and shipped toys to Los Angeles from New York (where I live) to make absolutely sure baby Oliver (age 2) will have a wonderful Christmas. All the presents are wrapped in pretty paper and ribbons, so it’s Christmas in a box.</p>

        <p>I was telling my daughter Diana that Santa Claus was spotted having a drink with a top FedEx official at the Four Seasons on Doheny Drive in Los Angeles and that they made a deal—Santa won’t be doing all the delivery to children worldwide—he is partnering with FedEx. Then I heard rumors that Santa also had a secret meeting with UPS brass in New York at the Peninsula Hotel. With Mercury retrograde, Santa does not want to disappoint the children everywhere, so he’s outsourcing to get help. Smart—you should, too.</p>
<p>On top of all this, your ruler Mars will go retrograde too, from December 6 to February 23. Although by February 23 things will speed up and productivity will be more evident, it will take until April 30 for things to be fully functional and back to normal. Mars will retrograde in Leo, and he’ll travel backwards into Cancer by January 6. Mars is the energy planet that helps us be productive, but the universe wants us all to look back and make adjustments and tweaks to our plan or way of living.</p>
<p>On the heels of Mars finally turning direct February 23, Venus will go retrograde from March 1 to April 12. If you are planning to do Botox or fillers, you would not want to do it while Mars is retrograde (Mars rules sharp instruments, which your dermatologist would need to use). You need to avoid beauty treatments while Venus is retrograde, too. Overlapping Venus, Mercury will begin to retrograde March 14 to April 7 in Aries.</p>
<blockquote><p>The month will be capped off by a wonderful new moon in Capricorn, opening up an entirely new chapter in your professional life.</p></blockquote>

        <p>As you see, we will have a slow start to the year with clients, management, and you changing course more than once. Everyone, of every sign, will be affected by this, but things will improve drastically by April 30. You will find that people will take a long time making up their mind, so you will need a plan B in the meantime.</p>
<p>The good news is that you are doing well in your career. Saturn, which rules Aries’ tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement, is moving at top speed. Venus is currently in your tenth house, making you the apple of the eye of VIPs who matter. You are popular with peers and subordinates too, and as said, you are doing well, even if you are not sure you are.</p>
<p>These retrogrades will give you a chance to breathe for they’ll open up your schedule. As an Aries, you want to see progress fast—but none of us (of any sign) will be able to accomplish a high level of productivity. Expect to have time to focus on finding ways to improve your method of going about your work and keeping your home life humming, too.</p>
<p>The new moon over November 30-December 1 (depending on your time zone) is in Sagittarius, 10 degrees, and will give you a yen to travel to a distant place. If the thought of taking a trip, whether for business or personal reasons, is out of the question, you might still be working closely with someone based far from home over the phone, email, and Zoom. Alternatively you may be working hard on a publishing or broadcasting assignment, or attending college and beginning your new semester.</p>

        <p>At this new moon, Jupiter will be prominent, partnering with the Sun and new moon from across the sky—Jupiter is in Gemini. Jupiter will promote good feelings, ease relationships with people overseas, and open your mind to new ideas and greater possibilities within each project. Just as importantly, your ruler Mars in Leo will reach out to the Sun and new moon in a gorgeous trine, so if you do have to travel, you would enjoy the time away in early December—things would go well.</p>
<p>Saturn will be in hard angle to the Sun and new moon November 30-December 1, so it’s clear you will feel the pressure at work to perform. Still, Venus in Capricorn will receive glittering, heavenly beams from Uranus, the planet of all things unexpected, so you could see a surprise breakthrough. I know I’ve already said this, but you are doing far better on the job than you think you are. I don’t want you to be too hard on yourself because as an Aries, you set a very high bar.</p>
<p>The full moon on December 15 in Gemini, 24 degrees, will be filled with sugar and space. This full moon will be in wide conjunction to Jupiter, which is the very best aspect, indicating this full moon will bring plenty of accolades, fun, and a feeling of being pampered. Full moons are operative for as many as five days beyond the date they arrive (bringing you up to December 20).</p>
<p>This full moon of December 15 will also urge you to travel, only this time you would more likely go to a destination that is much closer to home. Mars will be smiling at Mercury, so travel would be fun—even luxurious. Mercury will also be super-friendly to Venus and Pluto, both posited in your friendship sector, so it appears you will be hearing from close friends who will want to arrange a get-together.</p>
<p>Mercury’s friendliness to Mars is important—Mercury is the most dominant planet at this full moon and will set the tone. This is a plus. Neptune, however, will edge near Aries in a historic move, and when Neptune finally reaches Aries, it will be the first time in your life time that this planet of imagination will occupy your sign.</p>

        <p>Neptune will enter Aries on March 30, 2025, and will remain in Aries until October 22, 2025, when Neptune will retreat back to Pisces (where it is now, although at the very end of the sign). Neptune won’t to return to Aries until January 26, 2026, at which time he will stay until March 23, 2039. (The last time Neptune was in Aries was from 1861 to 1875.)</p>
<p>Neptune can encourage you to be highly creative, and this is no small blessing. It will expand your right-brain thinking and also help you become talented in any of the arts—music, dance, painting, sculpture, art, photography, film, game development, poetry—these and any other artistic disciplines where symbols and gestures matter.</p>
<p>Neptune can sometimes have a down side, in that Neptune can make you put a veil over reality so that all appears beautiful, like a dream, but your vision won’t always be real. Neptune on December 15 will be in conflict (a square) to the Sun in Sagittarius and the moon in Gemini. This may make you assume that a certain deal is going to yield much more profit than is reasonable.</p>
<p>All month you will have Mars in Leo, which is a good placement for you. True, Mars is in weak retrograde, but at least Mars is supportive and interested in helping out in the romance department. If you have children, this month will bring pure joy. (Romance and your children are in the same house, and both will benefit from Mars in Leo.)</p>

        <p>The month will be capped off by a wonderful new moon in Capricorn, 10 degrees, opening up an entirely new chapter in your professional life. That Capricorn new moon will appear on December 30, and it is the most important new moon to help you advance in your career in 2025 for it will light your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement.</p>
<p>To judge how this may play out for you, we need to look to Saturn. Wonderful news—Saturn is cheering you on and will be one of your biggest planetary supporters. This new moon will be influential for months (until July 26). Your ruler Mars, still in highly compatible fire-sign Leo, will send Neptune a “high-five,” encouraging creative experimentation. As I said before, you are doing GREAT in your career. This December 30 new moon will prove it. If you want to change jobs or get a promotion, you can do it—even with Mars retrograde. Never underestimate the tremendous power of a friendly new moon.</p>
<p>Now turning to the holidays, this year, for the first time in a long time, Christmas and Chanukah will fall on the same day, December 25, when the moon will glide into Scorpio, a highly spiritual, compassionate sign. Scorpio is also a highly private sign, so it will be time to treat yourself to a small family celebration, one that gives you a cozy feeling of seclusion and possibly rest. You will want to spend quality time with those who matter most to you.</p>
<p>I remember saying to my mother (who taught me astrology), “I have such great aspects, but nothing is happening.” She was washing dishes but turned to me and asked, “Susan, do you have a new moon in the right house to trigger those good aspects?” I shook my head no, and she reminded me, “Then nothing will happen until you get that powerful new moon.” Dear Aries, on December 30 you HAVE that powerful new moon for your career. If you are self-employed, you can attract new clients now . Overall, all Aries can get more support and cooperation on the job. You are working against some headwinds with Mars retrograde, but don’t let up with your efforts—you will find that all the work you are doing now will add up to sensational results in 2025.</p>

        <p>New Year’s Eve brings the transiting moon to Capricorn, so news about your career may have you celebrating. You might even be invited to a party within the week that follows December 30 that includes many of the people you work with and report to—some top-level people are likely to be present.</p>
<p>All in all, while everyone will be dealing with the slow pace of the first months of 2025, you can still make progress. You clearly are a shining star, and you are only cranking up, dear Aries. Wait till you see how well you do in 2025!</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>December introduces a trend that will last almost three months, from December 6 to February 23. It will mark a period when Mars will be retrograde. After the retrograde is over, Mars will take until April 30 to be fully strong and functional. This is frustrating news for everyone, but perhaps more for you as you are ruled by Mars (a planetary rulership you share with Scorpio).</p>
<p>Any retrograde planet initiates a time of reflection and correction and urges you to examine your recent past by making tweaks to the methods you’ve been using. During Mars retrograde, it is often hard to sell, convince, or persuade anyone of anything, whether in your business or personal life. You will find clients, customers, bosses, friends, and family to be a bit skittish about moving forward.</p>
<p>In a way they are right to hesitate—Mars teaches us how to be competitive and ultimately win. However, with Mars asleep at the switch, it’s not a good time to launch a new product or company, close on a house, or negotiate a settlement, as several examples of a nearly unlimited number of possibilities.</p>

        <p>Mars will start his retrograde in Leo on December 6, but after January 6 he’ll spend most of the time retrograding in Cancer, going direct on February 23, but remaining in Cancer until April 17, so in the coming weeks your home and family will become a big focus.</p>
<p>Cancer rules the home, so you may be looking at new spaces to move into, or you may already be in the process of moving. Mars often brings noise, commotion, or movement—see how this works out for you. You might be redecorating, hosting sleepover guests, or having parties at your home. If you have children, one or more of them may become a major focus.</p>
<p>Mars in Leo is a better place for you, and you will like the period Mars tours Leo—December 6, 2024, to January 6, 2025, and then from April 18 to June 17—it could be quite festive and romantic. If you are single, these periods will afford you a prime time to meet someone new. If you have children, plan a special vacation or other surprise event for your them at some point during that mid-April to mid-June period—you would be weaving a lasting childhood memory.</p>
<p>Speaking of travel, the new moon of November30-December 1 that occurred last month will strongly affect you during the first two weeks of December (and as long as five months looking forward) and stimulate your desire to travel to a distant city. That new moon will be in perfect communication with Mars, now positioned in your fifth house of romance, leisure, fun, and creative, artistic expression. If you have children, Mars will also encourage you to devote quality time with them.</p>
<p>Saturn will be in hard angle to the Sun and new moon of November 30-December 1 however, so you may find it hard to go anywhere this month because obligations at work and at home might hold you back. If this is true for you, keep in mind that you will have more opportunities to enjoy travel, especially in mid-June 2025. At that time Saturn will not press on you, and Mars will again be supportive. This month, if you cannot travel, the client may come to you, or you may be dealing with people at a distance over email, phone, and teleconference.</p>

        <p>The new moon of November 30-December 1 (influential for months) may instead find you delving into intellectual activities, such as attending classes, in real life or online, or dropping into a bookstore to hear a favorite author explain her new book. A project involving the media or legal matters shine, too.</p>
<p>Mercury has been retrograding from November 25 and will finally end its retrograde on December 15, a warning that you need to shop and ship holiday gifts by the first week of December. You can expect delayed packages and low inventory this holiday season, so your time will be more productive if you begin and finish your shopping early.</p>
<p>Although retailers have tried to entice shoppers with attractive sales during Mercury retrograde, a gift is not a bargain if your recipient doesn’t enjoy it or want it. Perhaps your recipient will wish you had purchased another brand or model. If you are shopping for teens or adults, consider giving gift cards (jotting down the serial number in case it gets lost). Gift cards are always appreciated. Shop for the children on your list during the first week of December to be sure you capture the hot toy every little child will love.</p>
<p>The full moon of December 15 could bring frustrating weather delays, if you are due to travel. Neptune will be prominent at the full moon, especially from December 15 to 21. Neptune rules snow, fog, rain, and hail storms. This full moon will simultaneously engender short travel, so in case you are driving to northern cities in cold climates, have your car tuned up before the trip and make sure your car is ready for any weather you might face. You may be visiting a sibling, and if so, this would be a great idea—Jupiter will conjoin that full moon (wide degree) and bring happiness to your third house of siblings and cousins.</p>

        <p>Mercury will have a large say of how things go at the December 15 full moon, and happily, as Mercury will be in perfect angle to Mars in Leo, things should ultimately go well (barring anything in your chart that I cannot see from where I sit). Mars will work to bring enchantment and a festive mood.</p>
<p>Mercury will come out of retrograde the same day as this full moon, adding a note of relief. Communication from people you’ve not heard from in a long time will brighten the entire month. It will be fun catching up.</p>
<p>New Year’s Eve will still feel a full moon that will reach a crest the day prior in Capricorn on December 30. You may be celebrating a promotion or a new position to start in January, adding excitement to the New Year. Looking ahead, you will have much to be grateful for and many positive career developments to anticipate.</p>
