        <p>Travel is written all over your chart, not only this month, but during most of 2024 when good-fortune Jupiter entered your ninth house on May 25. This lovely trend this will continue until June 9, 2025, so you have plenty of time to dream about where you’d like to go. Jupiter is bringing opportunity to go to a foreign country you’ve never seen but always hoped to visit. Jupiter comes by this house every 12 years and remains there for 12 months. You have this trend now.</p>
<p>The ninth house gives a broadening intellectual experience. Jupiter, a planet not only of good fortune but of growth and expansion, will coax you to view your life on a larger scale than you have previously. You will see possibilities in ventures that earlier you would have viewed in more narrow terms. You will be eager to learn, not just skim the surface but go deeper on subjects that interest you.</p>
<p>Some Libras will travel internationally, which the ancients felt was a superb way to learn about the world—by immersing yourself in a culture. Other Libras will go off to finish college or graduate school (also covered by the ninth house). Others will be drawn to reading the work of deep thinkers, and others will delve into reading the works of great philosophers—all covered by the ninth house that is so lit up for you by benefic Jupiter. This is the place you may seek meaning in life. It covers an intellectual approach to religion and spirituality. (The twelfth house, however, rules pure belief.)</p>
<p>This month, you have a friendly new moon on November 30 or December 1 (depending on your time zone). The new moon appears in Sagittarius, 10 degrees, and Sagittarius is a highly compatible fire sign that blends beautifully with your air-sign Libra Sun. Appearing in your third house, this new moon will strike up a flurry of activity, and you’ll be working fast, handling everything that crosses your desk with alacrity.</p>

        <p>The third house is a communications hub where your skills in writing, speaking, editing, researching, translating, teaching, selling, marketing, public relationships, or generating advertising concepts will be hailed by the team, higher-ups, and with clients. You may be negotiating a deal, or you may be drawing up (or looking over) a contract and asking and answering the questions that will inevitably come. If you are given a contract to sign, see if you can wait until later in December—it would bring a far better outcome for you and the other party. Here is why.</p>
<p>Mercury has been retrograding since November 25 and will go direct on December 15. If you do have any legal paperwork given to you, show it to your lawyer, which is always wise (even if Mercury isn’t retrograde). Doing so will let you to buy time. As said, Mercury goes direct December 15, but no planet regulates its orbit the moment it goes direct. It will take Mercury until January 2 to be strong again. If you can wait, that would be an ideal time to sign.</p>
<p>If you can’t wait that long, sign your paperwork on one of your best personal days, December 19, when Venus and Jupiter will be in ideal harmony (a “trine”), and good luck, happiness and prosperity will likely follow you.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mars will fill your house of friendship from December 6 until January 6, and that will be perfect for the festive holiday season.</p></blockquote>

        <p>There’s a strong chance you will be taking a number of short trips or drives (within 200 miles), especially at the start of December, in the first week to 10 days. You will also have plenty of opportunities to pack and go during the months ahead.</p>
<p>A new moon has a long range of influence, extending for five months, but a new moon is strongest in the week that it appears and then very gradually declines in strength. This month seems to bring intriguing business appointments and a number of fun party invitations—you can choose among the best. I love this new moon because Jupiter in Gemini is partnering with the Sun and new moon in Sagittarius, making you optimistic and jovial and allowing the reason your trips will likely go well.</p>
<p>There is an indication that you might not be able to travel now because your work life is due to be very busy. This tells me that if you do travel short distances, it might be for business, to see clients.</p>
<p>The third house rules sisters, brothers, and cousins, too—so you may be on the phone with one of these individuals to bubble up ideas for seeing each other or to hatch a surprise for your parents or to discuss gift giving, the holiday dinner, or other plans.</p>
<p>If your birthday falls on October 2, plus or minus five days, you will notice the positive influence of the new moon November 30/December 1 very much. The same is true if you have either your natal moon in Libra or Libra rising at 10 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. Also, look to see if you have a planet in your natal birth chart in Gemini, Libra, Aquarius, Aries, Leo, or Sagittarius at 10 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. If you do, that planet—and the house where it is positioned—will light up for you, and that planet will help you quite a bit.</p>

        <p>Regarding your chances for an enchanting holiday, starting December 7, graceful Venus will enter fellow air-sign Aquarius. If you are single, Venus in this sign—and moving through your fifth house of true love—will brighten your chances to meet a special romantic interest at one of the holiday parties you’ll be attending this month. Venus will remain in this perfect-for-you placement until January 2. Lucky you! You’ll be all set for this festive month. When you shop for gifts, it looks like you’ll find a few wardrobe items for yourself—they will be madly flattering and too tempting to pass up.</p>
<p>The full moon in wholly compatible Gemini will arrive on December 15. Even though you might say, “There’s no way I can travel in December! I have too much to do!”—you might because Jupiter is glittering in your ninth house of distant travel, so a surprise air ticket from someone who loves you might show up in your stocking by the fireplace. The trip may happen this month, or the gift might be for sometime later, during the first half of 2025. It is alternatively possible you will be hosting a visitor from far away, whether for scheduling business meetings or a good friend—in which case it will be fun catching up.</p>
<p>At the time of the full moon Saturn will still be pressing on you, reminding you of obligations regarding your home and family and the work you still have to complete at the office.</p>
<p>Neptune will be in a challenging position to the full moon too, so if you do plan to travel, make sure you have all up-to-date addresses of your destinations printed out on a paper itinerary in case your smart phone or computer runs out of battery life. Nail down your accommodations, and have them guaranteed to be sure they will hold no matter how late you might arrive. Neptune is famous for creating fog, both literally and metaphorically, so aim for clarity in your communication. Also, make sure your car (if driving) has been tuned up to handle any weather conditions you might face, including snow or hail.</p>

        <p>Mercury will have a big role to play at the full moon of December 15. Mercury goes direct on this day, which would help reduce delays. Mars (even though having recently turned retrograde) will reach out to Mercury in a friendly way, and that, too, will be an advantage for Mercury is orbiting in your third house of travel and Mars is, at the time of the full moon, still in your highly social friendship sector.</p>
<p>Mars will be retrograde from December 6 until February 23, a very long time—a little over 11 weeks. Mars will start out retrograding in Leo and fill your house of friendship from December 6 until January 6, and that will be perfect for the festive holiday season. Then Mars continues his backward slide and move into Cancer to light your tenth house of professional career honors, awards, and achievement until April 17, quite a long time. (However, on February 23 Mars will reverse course and go direct, which will help you in your productivity.)</p>
<p>While Mars is retrograde, you will find clients slow to make decisions and commit to new projects, or to make a decision at all. Don’t push too hard. It’s actually not an ideal time to work on anything new. It’s better to reflect on past projects and to analyze what went right and what went wrong—do a post-project wrap-up.</p>
<p>Mars is the planet that teaches us all the value of being competitive and to win, and with Mars out of commission, all projects will take more time, energy, and money than you and your client expected. You won’t lose any competitive advantage by being patient—you will avoid a lot of frustration. Also, everyone of every sign will feel Mars retrograde in one way or another, so we are all in the same boat.</p>

        <p>Christmas Day and the start of Chanukah both fall on the same day this year, December 25, which is unusual. The transiting moon will be in Scorpio, suggesting you will most likely plan a quiet, family-oriented joyous holiday. With the moon in Scorpio, you may be surprised how generous someone will be to you this year.</p>
<p>The new moon that will fall December 30 in Capricorn, 10 degrees, is an interesting one. It will light your sector of home and family, bringing opportunities and options to improve your living experience that you’ve not had previously. That new moon might just be the best one that you will have had in over a year. If you want to move, by all means, begin to browse houses and apartments the minute the year begins. New moons are influential for five months, but are their very strongest in the week to 10 days after they appear. If you want to renovate or buy new furniture or other accoutrements, this is the time to see what the world holds for you.</p>
<p>I love this new moon because Saturn will take on the role of most important planet, and instead of taunting you (as Saturn did earlier this month), Saturn will be amazingly supportive of your home-oriented quest. If, on the other hand, you have been trying to help one of your parents with a living solution, you can do that. Saturn in a supremely friendly attitude can bring you long-term happiness in your new space and give you a feeling of security you may not have felt in a long time—or ever!</p>
<p>Neptune and Mars will be in lovely sync suggesting you will like the creative ideas you add to your space if you are decorating. By all means look at possibilities in the beginning of January—even if you had previously looked and found nothing that interested you, this new moon will be the one to open new home-related vistas for you.</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>It’s December, and you will be bitten by the travel bug. You are a fantastic people person, always interested in what others are doing and the news they have to share. You enjoy keeping current with a wide variety of friends. Family is important to you too, and you masterfully mix these two worlds into a whole in a way others cannot do, and magically, everyone benefits. Mixing people together of all ages and walks of life can make for a richer social experience, the reason everyone attends your social events, for they are unusual and satisfying in a unique way.</p>
<p>The new moon of December 1 lights up your third house of travel and communication. This suggests you’ll be taking more short trips than usual in the weeks and months ahead. The third house also rules your sister, brother, or cousin, so you might be planning a trip to see your close relative and have a festive dinner together.</p>
<p>You may be given papers to sign, but try to wait at least until Mercury is out of retrograde on December 15, and then leave a space of days after it officially goes direct. Your best time to sign would be after January 2, but if you cannot wait that long, sign on December 19 when Venus will be in lovely sync with Jupiter.</p>
<p>From September through early November, you’ve likely been progressing in your career (or at least attempting to do so) for you had action Mars to help you gain attention and build momentum. Now Mars will start to go into weak retrograde orbit starting December 6 and will continue to retrograde until February 23. That’s a very long time. Mars is the natural ruler of your marriage and committed partnership sector, so if you have a collaborator in business, such as an agent, manager, accountant, specialized lawyer, or other professional, you may feel your partner is holding up the works, too hesitant to make a decision and not working hard to support you.</p>

        <p>This may be true in business, but also in a married Libra’s relationship. While this may happen during Mars retrograde, keep in mind that this is only temporary. Be patient and allow your partner some slack. It’s actually beneficial to go slowly during Mars retrograde. Schedule the biggest initiations for May and beyond, for Mars will no longer be retrograde after February 23, but Mars will need time to readjust his strength, and that will take until April 30.</p>
<p>Travel could again come up mid-month, at the full moon December 15 in Gemini. Good-fortune Jupiter will be within range of this full moon, adding brightness and favor. You may think that you aren’t going anywhere for the holidays, but an option for a trip may come up suddenly anyway—and it would be fun, with a touch of luxury.</p>
<p>It is true that Saturn will be in hard angle to the full moon and Sun and will put pressure on you to fulfill obligations and responsibilities at work and at home. If you are organized, and perhaps can enlist help from family, you can get things done and still manage to travel. Mercury will step up to be the dominant planet, and amazingly, Mars will send Mercury a super-harmonious sparkling beam, suggesting a successful outcome. Other areas of gain include import-export, international relationships, higher education, including college and graduate school study, legal matters, and work in publishing and broadcasting.</p>

        <p>The month’s final new moon will find you snuggled into home, other property, or with family. Your new moon on December 30 will help you improve your living experience and, even more importantly, give you a chance to share your love and appreciation to members of your family.</p>
<p>If you need to find a new place to live, by all means, this special new moon of December30 may bring you your dream apartment or house. You can make any kind of changes to your living environment, large or small, and will be pleased with the result. You can also find options to help a parent in their living arrangements or other concerns, even if you found that solutions eluded you in the past.</p>
<p>If you have been dating one person for a while, and you are feeling good about having a long-term relationship, you may want to introduce your sweetheart to your parents. If you are ready to become engaged, you might do so over New Year’s Eve against a brilliant wall of colorful fireworks—it is hard to get more romantic than that! Families generally come together at this time of the year, so you can share your news at a New Year’s Day dinner. Married couples may announce news, too.</p>
<p>There are many possibilities, both in terms of finding an ideal living space (or starting to create one) or being with, and doing things with and for, your parents and other family members. You will likely have a joyous start to the year.</p>
