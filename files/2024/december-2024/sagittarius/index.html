        <p>The universe has a lovely gift for your birthday—a new moon in Sagittarius, 10 degrees, that is due on December 1 (or November 30 in some locations). This new moon will act as a beautiful gift certificate that you can use as you please. A new moon in your sign only comes once a year, and this one is ready to help you progress on a desire dear to you. What would that be, dear Sagittarius?</p>
<p>The universe will need to know your priorities, or it may wind up giving you something that’s not on your checklist. Show the universe that you’re working toward your desire for great aspects—don’t just expect your wishes to be delivered without doing your part. If you begin to work on this after the new moon, you will soon see that the universe is listening.</p>
<p>This new moon in Sagittarius is a peach, for Mars will support it from his perch in Leo (a sign that blends perfectly with yours). Mars is in your ninth house of international travel, so you may have tried to book a long-distance trip but weren’t able to go. As an alternative, people in international settings may be accented in your daily life, and you may be working on a project together through email, Zoom, and FedEx and never need to physically go abroad.</p>
<p>Mars will light up your ninth house from the start of the month until January 6. The ninth house is an intellectual center of learning and exploration. Ancient astrologers felt travel was the best way to learn about the world, especially if the travel was to a foreign country that could provide a doorway to understanding a new culture through studying the art, music, architecture, literature, poetry, fashion, cuisine, religions, history, and heritage landmarks. Each in its own way reveals the spirit and heart of the people. Not surprisingly, college and graduate study also fall under the ninth house.</p>

        <p>After you have developed expertise, you might want to share it with the world, and that is the reason professors and teachers at the college level are included in this part of your chart. It is also the reason the publishing and broadcasting industries are included in this area that is currently so lit up for you. Sagittarians are known to be talented novelists who can create compelling stories that people just can’t put down. One of the areas I listed here will become important to you now and in the first half of 2025.</p>
<p>Saturn, currently in Pisces, might challenge you at the new moon in Sagittarius on December 1 because it will be in hard square to the new moon. It may be that you’ll get a chance to travel, but things going on at home, such as caring for your children or an elderly parent, may cause you to think twice about going anywhere. Saturn will remind you of your responsibilities.</p>
<p>If you are in the middle of a major renovation (most likely because you had water damage), you may need to stay home to oversee the work. There may be an indication at this new moon that Saturn will be standing in the doorway, preventing you from moving forward.</p>

        <p>There is an added complication. Mars is about to go retrograde on December 6, and he won’t go direct until 11 weeks later on February 23. It is hard to convince anyone of anything when Mars is retrograde—in your personal or professional life. Mars rules assertive energy and the willingness to compete well, and he coaxes you to be courageous and daring. Little of that happens when Mars is in retrograde.</p>
<p>Mars is the energy planet, and this is akin to the gas you put in your car to make it run. No gas, no go. We are so used to having a strong Mars behind us that it may be confusing at first when he’s not there (Mars retrogrades every two years for typically eight to 11 weeks). You may wonder why everything is taking more time, money, and your own energy to be productive. Clients will take a long time to make up their mind, and it would be better not to push them. They’re right to hesitate—Mars retrograde is not a time to begin important new ventures.</p>
<p>Mars is the natural ruler of your solar fifth house of love and romance, so with Mars about to retrograde, you may change your mind about the person you are seriously dating. Don’t make any major decisions yet—give the relationship more time if you feel it has potential. This same house rules children, so alternatively, you may be trying to decide on a way to best help one of your children (such as if one is struggling with a certain subject in school, as one of many possible examples), but you may waffle a little about the best route to take.</p>
<p>If neither of these situations come up, a third way Mars might affect you is that a creative project may need some revisions. If so, take time to think about exactly what would be best before you dive in.</p>

        <p>Although it will be a relief when you get to February 23, the date Mars goes direct, it will take Mars some time to build back up to the energy level he had before he went retrograde. That will happen by April 30.</p>
<p>This is a tricky month, because last month Mars’ little mischievous brother Mercury was in retrograde, too. Mercury started his backward slide on November 25 and will go direct December 15.</p>
<p>Mercury is the planet of communication, commerce, shipping, and travel. It is critical that you send out your packages early, for there will be delays. This could be anything, ranging from treacherous weather, strikes, low inventory in the stores, or finding out your favorite item is backordered—there may be other frustrating conditions as well.</p>
<p>Shipping early will keep you calm. Mercury also rules the moving parts in all machines and electronic items, so it’s not ideal to buy expensive, high-tech items right now—avoid buying cars, too.</p>
<p>Mercury is tied to your solar tenth house of career honors, awards, and achievement, so if your career seems to lag, it is due to the slow pace of Mercury. This should clear up once Mercury goes direct and has rebuilt its strength—that will happen January 2.</p>

        <p>If you recall, Mercury’s big brother Mars will go direct on February 23, but just a week later, Venus will go retrograde, from March 1 to April 12.</p>
<p>When Venus is retrograde, it is not the time to do anything expensive to your looks—no Botox, fillers, or face lifts, and no dramatic changes to your hair. If you work in the beauty industry, in fine jewelry and watches, specialty wines, gourmet foods, designer clothing, or other luxury goods (all ruled by Venus), business will slow down. It will take Venus until May 16 to normalize and strengthen her orbit again.</p>
<p>Now that you have the lay of the land, you can make plans to avoid problems. After a very slow start to the year 2025, mid-May to June looks to be especially productive for everyone.</p>
<p>You might be disappointed to hear that Mars will be in a weak position and mess up your chances of travel in December—this is an important activity for you, for as a Sagittarius, you need travel like oxygen. Don’t be blue. You won’t have to wait two years for Mars to come back to Leo (as would normally be the case). Mark down April 17 to June 17. This will be a positively glorious period for Mars will be back in Leo and stronger than ever—a time you can do any ninth house activity, including traveling far and wide.</p>
<p>I know you are used to seeing Mercury go retrograde frequently, and you may be wondering if he will mess things up once we get to May. But no, Mercury will thankfully not go retrograde again until July 17 to August 11.</p>

        <p>Coming back to the here and now, you and I discussed the new moon December 1 in Sagittarius earlier, and if your birthday falls within five days of this date, you will feel the benefits of this new moon strongly. This is also true if you have Sagittarius rising or your natal moon in Sagittarius at 10 degrees, plus or minus five degrees.</p>
<p>Now have a look at your chart. Do you have a natal planet at 10 degrees, plus or minus five degrees, in Sagittarius, Aries, Leo, Gemini, Libra, or Aquarius? If so, that planet will be activated by this new moon and work hard for you.</p>
<p>At the new moon period in the first half of December, you will be urged to think about your own needs and desires. Then on the full moon on December 15, you will turn your attention to your partner in marriage or in business. In your professional life that would include a business partner, agent, publicist, manager, accountant, lawyer, or any other expert you might have in your life who works in a direct and confidential way with you.</p>
<p>The full moon on December 15 will fall in Gemini at 24 degrees. Good-fortune Jupiter is also in Gemini and will be in wide conjunction to this full moon (within 8 degrees), which is still within the circle of significant influence. This is great! While everyone will like this full moon, you may like it more because Jupiter happens to be your ruling planet.</p>

        <p>This may be a time when you will decide about the future of an important relationship. If you are in love, you may get engaged. If you recall, this will be the same day that transiting Mercury in Sagittarius will go direct, speeding up your timetable. Mercury in better shape will soon release you (or a partner) from any indecision.</p>
<p>Mercury will be the chairman in charge of this full moon on December 15, and happily, Mercury will be quite the chatty Cathy, making friends with Mars in Leo, Pluto in Aquarius, and Venus in Aquarius. This suggests your decision will please you, and its link to Pluto and Venus suggests prosperity to come, even in a marriage.</p>
<p>As I said before, Mercury will be going forward on December 15, but avoid making any major decisions for a few days. Wait until your best day, December 19, when Venus and your ruler Jupiter will be in sync. After a planet goes direct, it is unstable for a while. It would ideally be better to wait to cement your relationship on or after Januarys 2, the date Mercury returns to full strength. However, if you can’t wait that long, use December 19.</p>
<p>As a Sagittarius, you tend to hold off on making commitments to partners. You like to be unfettered and free to come and go as you like with no strings holding you down. Still, even you might come to the realization that no man is an island unto himself (to quote poet John Dunne). We cannot get far by being isolated, and we are all, in many ways, interconnected and interdependent.</p>

        <p>Neptune will be square the December 15 full moon, so you may be dealing with a current or past bout of water damage to your home. Alternatively, if you have been puzzled by a family secret, it is likely that Neptune will make that secret known at this full moon, clearing up the mystery.</p>
<p>If your birthday falls on or within five days of December 15, you will feel the energy of this full moon very directly. (My website AstrologyZone.com started on December 14, 1995, so it will feel this full moon, too. Yes, companies and entities have birthdays.) This is also true if you have Sagittarius rising or your natal moon in Sagittarius at 24 degrees, plus or minus five degrees.</p>
<p>Take a look at your chart and see if you have a planet within five degrees of 24 degrees in Sagittarius, Aries, Leo, Gemini, Libra, or Aquarius. If you have such a planet, you will feel this full moon in a more positive way. That planet will make his identity and assistance known to you through the events that come up around you.</p>
<p>Now I will draw your attention to December 24, when Saturn and your ruler Jupiter will be at odds, a rare aspect that has not happened since 2016. This is a time to rethink old patterns and habits, especially those related to home, family, and financial matters. It’s time to develop new, more efficient and productive strategies, methods, habits, and structures to accomplish your goals. Stay optimistic—this will only improve life, not disrupt it.</p>

        <p>In this incredibly busy month, we have another new moon, this time on December 30 in Capricorn at 10 degrees. This new moon is set to light your second house of salary, earned income, and possessions. As a Sagittarian, you generally don’t like to spend a lot of time thinking about money—your world is one that revolves around debate of current events and delving deep into philosophical thinking. Yet everybody has to deal with money management sooner or later, and this will be your time to do so.</p>
<p>You may be writing checks so that you can close the books on 2024, and you might receive a bonus or cash advance at this time, too. Whatever you devote yourself to will be well worth your time. Saturn will step up and take over the steering of this new moon, and by a wonderful coincidence, Saturn will be in ideal harmony with the Sun and new moon, imparting his gifts of stability, financial security, and (if you have a plan) future growth.</p>
<p>Saturn is currently based in your home sector (fourth house), so you may be saving up for a new house or condo apartment, or you may be actually closing on a piece of property in the days that follow December 30. You could also receive a sizable check from your family that would suddenly allow you to put a down payment on a house.</p>
<p>If you recently put in an application for a mortgage, you might hear from your banker shortly after this new moon arrives, and he or she could give you news that makes your dream of home ownership a beautiful reality.</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You will enter December in high spirits. The month starts with the new moon in Sagittarius on November 30 or December 1 (depending on your time zone). This new moon is in agreement with action Mars, who has been heating up your long-distance travel sector since November 3. He will continue to do so until January 6.</p>
<p>Almost nothing makes you as happy as the prospect of visiting a distant land, for you are the international travel sign. Saturn is in hard angle to the new moon on December 1, so the only reason that you might have to stay back has to do with all that is happening at home or regarding family obligations in early December. There may be physical changes to your home that are underway or obligations to care for a family member. If this should be true, you will have more opportunities to travel in the spring, from April 17 to June 17. That might be a better time to go—and here is why.</p>
<p>Mars is about to go retrograde on December 6 until February 23, 2025, which is quite a long time. Mars is the natural ruler of your fifth house of happiness, fun, and love, which includes children and your own creative expressions, so if you are traveling for personal reasons, you might enjoy a trip more if you save it for another time—when Mars won’t be retrograde. Most people find business deals are harder to finalize when Mars is in retrograde, too. Fortunately, Mars goes retrograde only every two years for eight to 11 weeks. This year Mars will be retrograde for just over 11 weeks.</p>

        <p>Mars’ little brother Mercury is currently retrograde, a trend that started on November 25 and will continue until December 15. You may have to “make do” by giving holiday gift cards if finding the perfect present for family and friends becomes frustrating. Many items will be out of stock, so if you do want to shop, have backup ideas in case your first choice isn’t available. You might also want to consider giving an experiential gift, such as a gift certificate to a spa or a weekend of perfecting the art of French cooking, as two examples.</p>
<p>The full moon in Gemini on December 15 will bring an important culmination to a partnership matter—and that might mean a romantic engagement will materialize. If you are already married, you may be making plans for the New Year together. Alternatively, you may be meeting with a client to crystallize an important business deal that you’ve been working toward for a long time.</p>
<p>Mercury will be the planet in charge during the full moon on December 15, and happily, Mercury is able to rally the support of Mars, Venus, and Pluto to boost the results of this full moon—travel and commitment will be accented. Also, a legal document or contract may appear. (Mercury will go direct at the full moon December 15, but if signing papers, leave a space of several days before you plan to sign. I suggest December 19.) Your ruler Jupiter will orbit close to this full moon, ensuring that whatever comes up brings with it the promise of prosperity and happiness.</p>

        <p>The Sun will roll into Capricorn on December 21, and life will settle down. The frantic activity you may have felt earlier in the month will begin to evaporate, just in time to get you in the mood for a warm and spiritual holiday.</p>
<p>The new moon on December 30 in Capricorn will put you in the mood to send out bills and look over your financial achievements in 2024. You might make an appointment early in January for a consultation with your financial advisor. This new moon will be in superb angle to Saturn, and that can help you set up a plan that’s not only doable but that will leave you appreciably wealthier by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>After a busy December, you seem to want to opt for a quiet, private New Year’s Eve celebration with the one you love. You need not spend a lot to enjoy love a lot. It’s not where you go to celebrate, but rather who you are with that matters most.</p>
