        <p>Your career has occupied much of your thinking since benefic Jupiter entered your tenth house of prestigious professional advancement and began to stir up exciting possibilities. This is the first time in 12 years that Jupiter has spent time in this area of your chart, having entered on May 25, 2024, and this lucky planet is set to stay until June 9, 2025.</p>
<p>No wonder your attention has been riveted on your career—these have been some of the best and most positive months you have had in years to generate career growth and admiration for your accomplishments, from both peers and VIPs. It appears that you have been putting your time to good use.</p>
<p>This month, however, you will lavish time and attention on your adoring family. You are likely to notice this trend from the moment you enter December, thanks to the new moon in Sagittarius, 10 degrees, which will light your fourth house of home (or accent other property you may own, rent, or want to sell, renovate, or decorate). This same area of your chart rules your parents (including adoptive parents), as well as other members of your immediate family. This new moon will appear on November 30 or December 1, depending on your time zone.</p>
<p>Jupiter will have an important role to play at this time, and happily he is found orbiting opposite the new moon and Sun. This friendly partnership adds a generous, optimistic, and warm vibration to this new moon.</p>
<p>Saturn, however, is in hard angle to the new moon, which could create a little difficulty with your sweetheart—he or she might not want to spend the holidays with your family. There are other possible scenarios, but you may have an inkling of what sticky topic might come up with a partner. But Mars is ducking into a phone booth, putting on his cape, and emerging as Superman. As he zooms through space, Mars will send a brilliant, positive beam to the new moon and Sun. This makes me feel that you will be able to win over your partner with gentle persuasion.</p>

        <p>Last month your ruling planet Mercury went retrograde on November 25, and he will go direct on December 15. Mercury will be retrograde in Sagittarius in your home and family sector, so you may be of two minds concerning just about everything. You will waffle back and forth, but this is normal—you will feel better once Mercury settles down mid-month.</p>
<p>No planet returns immediately to its previous energetic state after retrograding. Instead, step by step the planet grows stronger, and in the case of Mercury, he will regain his full influence by January 2.</p>
<p>Mercury’s big brother Mars will also go retrograde this month. We are not used to seeing Mars in retrograde because he only does this every two years. This time Mars will retrograde on December 6 and stay in retrograde until February 23, a period of a little over 11 weeks! That’s a long time. It will take Mars longer than usual to get back to full power, until April 30.</p>
<blockquote><p>The positive developments in your career mid-month may be the best gift Santa could have ever delivered and placed under your tree.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Mars holds sway over your eighth house of other people’s money, so if anyone owes you money, it may take a long time to collect it. If you are in sales, you may find it hard to convince a client on the merits of a proposal. Clients will seem to hesitate or need to think and confer with their own team for weeks at a time.</p>
<p>Mars is often assertive, and he teaches us how to compete and win, but when he is found napping on the couch, we don’t have access to his help, and we are left to our own devices. Tasks, deals, and assignments may take more time, money, and energy to complete than you feel they should.</p>
<p>Dear Virgo, we are all in the same boat, for everyone will notice Mars retrograde in one way or another. You will not miss any competitive advantage. In fact, Mars will enter Virgo next year on June 17 and stay until August 6. In so many ways, this could mark a critical time in 2025 for you to get what you want. Fortunately for you, Mars will be in good strong shape by the time he journeys to the constellation of Virgo. Remarkably, by August you will also have the support of powerhouse Pluto and surprise-a-minute Uranus. Things should go very well for you—start to reshuffle (if necessary) your list of wishes and priorities.</p>
<p>While the new moon of December 1 will accent your home and family, encouraging you to make improvements to your living experience and to care for and nurture your family, the full moon on December 15 will switch you back to your excellent career.</p>
<p>On December 15 the full moon will appear in Gemini at 24 degrees in your tenth house of honors, awards, and achievement. This full moon will crystallize a career matter on or within five days after December 15.</p>

        <p>This could be one of your most exciting moments. Your career will reach an important landmark, and something to do with your work will reach a culmination or pinnacle. Your ruler Mercury will hold a pivotal role because he goes direct on the same day (December 15). Energy planet Mars will also shoot Mercury a dazzling ray (a heavenly “trine,” the best aspect you could ever wish to get). Mars, even though retrograde, will mitigate any downside to this full moon. Jupiter’s proximity to this full moon suggests that a friend may be instrumental in seeing that your work is acknowledged and rewarded.</p>
<p>At the time of the full moon in Gemini, Saturn in Pisces will be in a hard square to both the Sun in Sagittarius and the full moon. Saturn shows that if you take on a new position, it will require that you learn the ropes of a new facet of your specialty, and you will need to work very hard—thankfully, as a Virgo that has never deterred you. Friends wonder at your ability to sustain long periods of concentration on your work. You get more done in a week than they do in a month.</p>
<p>In your current chart, Saturn seems to represent a partner or collaborator who is very conservative in his or her thinking, and lately this person has been quite hesitant about approving or moving forward with your ideas. You may feel they are holding you back or making your life harder than it needs to be. (This person also could be your spouse if you are in an unhappy marriage, or perhaps someone you are forced to work with closely.)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you will be the golden one in your workplace, impressing VIPs with your experience, judgment, work ethic, focus, and enthusiasm, so don’t let any bumps in the road worry you.</p>

        <p>On Christmas Day, December 25—also the start of Chanukah—the transiting moon will be in Scorpio, a spiritual, mystical sign that blends beautifully with yours. You may need to take a short drive (or Uber) to visit a member of your family. It is likely to be a lovely, quiet, peaceful, and private day with family and friends.</p>
<p>A beautiful new moon will arrive on December 30 in Capricorn, 10 degrees, lighting the most romantic part of your chart—your fifth house. This comes just in time to look forward to a sweet and loving New Year. If you are single, by all means go out with friends, for you never know if you will strike up a conversation with someone new and interesting. If you are dating seriously, you are likely to have a bewitching evening made for romance with the person you love. In fact, you could become engaged—if you are ready and hoping for that development.</p>
<p>If you are married, as I had mentioned earlier, a portion of Virgos may be struggling with a difficult marriage, but that may not be the case for you—it could be someone at work who is the thorn in your side. If you are happily married, plan to make this New Year’s Eve special, even if you don’t usually celebrate this night. It has so much potential to make you happy, so weave a memory with golden threads. The transiting moon will still be in Capricorn, performing beautifully for you.</p>
<p>If you long for a baby, this new moon might help you realize that blessing. Although Saturn has been a problem now and then when it comes to relationships, Saturn will take the lead and send the very best greetings to this new moon on December 30. Promises made now can last forever.</p>

        <p>If your birthday falls on September 2, plus or minus five days, this new moon has your name on it. While every Virgo will find something to enjoy about this new moon, you are likely to be especially thrilled by it. The same is true if you have your natal moon or your ascendant (rising sign) in Virgo at 10 degrees, plus or minus five degrees.</p>
<p>Have a look at your chart. Do you have any planets in Virgo, Taurus, Capricorn, Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces at 10 degrees, plus or minus five degrees? That planet—and the house where it is based—will light up for you and bring you a happy set of circumstances. Exciting!</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>You’ve rightly been focused on your career ever since Jupiter entered Gemini in late May this year, but this month gives you a golden opportunity to switch your loving attention to your family. The new moon that appears on November 30 or December 1 (depending on your time zone) will encourage you to focus on your home and family during the first half of December. This new moon may also find you getting your home ready for holiday entertaining. Alternatively, you may be collecting bids for a move, renovation, paint job, or major repair you need to do in the New Year. If you are beginning work on a major project involving property, it will likely reach fruition during the full moon that will appear about six months into the New Year, on June 11, 2025.</p>
<p>Saturn will be in hard angle to the Sun and new moon, so you may take on too many duties at work—in that case, enlist support. Make sure you don’t run yourself down so much that you end up spending the holiday in bed with a bad cold, flu, or respiratory illness. Mars will help you, and people behind the scenes will likely be eager to assist. Keep your plans under wraps—any help you receive from a high-level person should remain confidential. At home, you have a chance to enjoy sparkling romance, and fun with children can bring you a feeling of deep personal joy. You will have time to spin a dream for them that emphasizes the true meaning of the holidays.</p>

        <p>The full moon on December 15 will fall in Gemini and emphasize your career sector with a brilliant blaze of light. You may hear news that you have scored a major professional victory, or you could be offered a promotion or new job from a competitive firm. You are almost certain to receive some kind of glowing acknowledgement of your talents and many contributions to your firm and your industry.</p>
<p>Good-fortune Jupiter will conjoin the full moon of December 15, indicating that you are about to bask in the limelight. Mercury will take a leadership role at this full moon, receiving support from action Mars and lovely Venus in your home sector. Your family will be proud of your accomplishments, and they’ll be happy to hear flattering words from colleagues and higher-ups who matter to you. The development in your career mid-month may work out to be the best gift Santa could have ever delivered and placed under your tree.</p>
<p>The cherry on top of the cake will be at the new moon on December 30, which is one of your most romantic full moons of the year. This new moon will coax you toward breathtaking romance, and the best part is that it will set the stage for weeks and possibly months of romance. If you are single, this new moon could create the ideal environment for love to flourish, in part because it falls in fellow earth-sign Capricorn in your sector of true love. Step out with friends, for you may meet someone who captures your attention on New Year’s Eve or in the New Year, especially at parties and other social gatherings.</p>
<p>If you are seriously dating someone or are already married, your partner will want to plan an enchanting evening that will be simply unforgettable. A proposal for marriage may unfold against a backdrop of stunning fireworks in the night sky at the stroke of midnight. Married and established couples should plan to ring in the New Year in style. If you are a great cook or enjoy ordering take-out, stay in, scatter rose petals, light the candles, and bring out your prettiest china. You don’t have to spend a lot to enjoy the warmth of affection. It’s not what you do, or how much you spend, but who you’re with when the clock strikes midnight and you welcome the New Year together.</p>
