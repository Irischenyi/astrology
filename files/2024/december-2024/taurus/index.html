        <p>As a Taurus, you are considered wise about money management. December will prove this to be true in several ways, for you have a new moon in Sagittarius, 10 degrees, on November 30-December 1 (depending on your time zone) that will appear in your eighth house of other people’s money.</p>
<p>You may be looking over your ledgers to see how your investments and savings performed in 2024, and you seem to want to close your ledgers by month’s end so that you can get an early jump on preparing your taxes. If you owe on student loans or a mortgage, you might be working on a plan to gently accelerate your payments in small but effective ways. It’s also a perfect time to do estate planning and to write or update your will. Getting finances in shape can be comforting when finished.</p>
<p>Jupiter in Gemini will partner with the new moon in Sagittarius December 1 (wide degree), and that portends profit from actions taken in the days that follow this new moon. Jupiter’s hard angle to Saturn suggests a new approach or restructuring may be in order. Early December would be a good time to meet with your accountant, and also to check in with your banker to find out about new banking products and services that you might want to take advantage of.</p>
<p>Both Pluto and Mars will be friendly to the new moon, and this represents considerable planetary help that will allow you to boost your overall financial picture. Pluto is quite an important financial planet and is posited in your tenth house of prestigious career accomplishment, so profits and fees will flow mainly from your career. Your hard work could show signs of paying off in the weeks and months ahead. I’ll tell you more about Mars in a moment.</p>

        <p>Your concentration on financial management, or work on a negotiation over a financial agreement, however, will end at the full moon December 15 in Gemini at 24 degrees. Financially, you’ve been doing exceptionally well with Jupiter in Gemini holding court in your second house of earned income. If you feel you have not been doing that well when it comes to earning money, you still have until early June 2025 to make use of this brilliant visit of Jupiter. This is first time in 12 years that Jupiter has visited your earned income house.</p>
<p>This full moon of December 15 might be tricky. Neptune will be in a challenging angle to both the full moon and Sun, so if your expectations concerning a financial matter are much too high, this full moon may force you to be more realistic.</p>
<p>Here are some examples. If you assumed you would get a generous sum for a year-end bonus or commission, win a big financial reward as a verdict in a jury trial, receive a better payout from a claim you sent your insurance company, or be granted a huge check in the division of property in your divorce, you may find you need to realign your thinking.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you are planning to ring in the New Year on foreign shores (possible), that could be amazingly romantic and memorable.</p></blockquote>

        <p>There are more examples. If you hope to get generous university financial aid or a large check from your ex to catch up on unpaid back child support or a large sum for the sale of something expensive, such as a car or property, this full moon will bring closure and bring you back to Earth.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you HAVE shown you are dealing with reality and have practical expectations, you won’t need to eschew wishful thinking (because you didn’t fall for that in the first place). In this case, you may be delighted with the financial results.</p>
<p>You may wonder if the answer this month will be based purely on fairness, even though fairness sometimes is not part of the equation. Sometimes the result hinges on the financial status of the other party. This information is out of your control, to which you may not be privy because the facets of the situation are often hidden. There is so much that happens behind the scenes.</p>
<p>If you are saying, “Wait! Isn’t Jupiter supposed to bring me more money and expand all my chances of seeing a rise in income?” Yes. Jupiter is a protector. Yet sometimes two seemingly opposite situations can be true at the same time: Jupiter has a little down side in that he can make you overly optimistic. In that case, the other planets step in and create a few checks and balances to bring in a clear perspective. That is what Neptune is doing here.</p>
<p>I do feel you will receive news about money at this full moon—and it seems you will be given a sum from a manager at work (perhaps giving you a raise in salary). Alternatively, you may get a valuable gift for the holidays, or you may see an impressive profit from an investment. See how much it is and how you feel about the final sum. Full moons work to cleanse and bring a floodlight of truth to the surface.</p>

        <p>Taurus never gets tired thinking about money, and this month seems to underscore this topic. However, if you feel you need a vacation from the holiday, and from all of December’s calculations, that will be possible—consider taking a distant trip sometime during the two weeks that follow the highly compatible new moon in Capricorn, 10 degrees, on December 30. If your birthday falls on April 30, plus or minus five days, you will feel the message of this new moon quite strongly.</p>
<p>If you can’t travel, you may be working with the import-export of ideas, goods, or services at work or closely with a company overseas with whom you’ll forge an important mutually beneficial international relationship. The house where this new moon in Capricorn will fall on December 30 is mainly an intellectual house that will coax you to take off any blinders that you might be wearing and open your mind to other cultures and to others’ ideas.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may be starting graduate, or undergraduate, school or decide to sign up for a seminar or series of classes to brush up on developments in your industry. Capricorn is a financial sign, so you might want to learn more about stocks and bonds and how to invest wisely, so a course you take might be about growing your money.</p>
<p>The new moon at the end of the month might tap your skills in communication, so you may be given a speaking, writing, or editing assignment, and you may need to do research before you begin. You would enjoy this—take on the challenge.</p>
<p>With all this going on, throughout the month you will also be very focused on your home, other property, or a family member who you are trying to help, such as one of your children or a parent. Mars is touring your fourth house of home in December but will go retrograde starting December 6 and languish in retrograde for a whopping 11 weeks, until February 23. This means if you hope to buy or sell property or renovate (all requiring large sums), it would be better to wait until May or beyond to do so. You may change your mind regarding a home, real estate, or home décor/design plan as you go through these weeks.</p>

        <p>Mars does not retrograde that often, only every two years, so this trend may not feel familiar. Mars is the high energy planet and teaches us how to compete to win, negotiate effectively, and strike a deal and bring it to a finish. Mars will start to retrograde in Leo, spotlighting your home and family, but on January 6, slide backward into Cancer, which will again highlight travel, but more likely trips of shorter distance.</p>
<p>Any retrograde planet will ask you to look back and reflect on a past decision or course of action or opinion you had taken. Mars will be back to Leo from April 17 to June 17 in a much stronger orbit, so if you waffle and can’t seem to settle on a decision from now through February, that’s OK. You may waffle (change your mind) more than once.</p>
<p>You will be on much sturdier ground for any home, property, or family matter from April 17 to June 17 than you are in December. Don’t push yourself to decide. Keep an open mind, and allow time to reflect on your options, which may not become immediately obvious but will come to your attention as you search for solutions.</p>
<p>Adding to the slow pace of December is the fact that Mercury, Mars’ copycat Dennis-the-Menace little brother, went retrograde on November 25 and will not go direct until December 15. Delays will come up, partly due to difficult weather, low inventory, and possible labor strikes. These types of events are out of your control, which could mean your package won’t be delivered in time. That would, of course, be stressful, so shop—and ship—early. If you need to buy an electronic item, buy it after December 15, or buy a gift card to give your recipient. Buying anything with moving parts or electronic chips is a known no-no during Mercury retrogrades. It’s also not wise to rush to sign legal papers while Mercury is retrograde—you may regret doing so later.</p>

        <p>No planet jumps to high energy the day it goes direct. Like people who awaken after a long sleep, a planet is not fully functional right as it turns direct—it needs time to regulate its orbit. Mathematically we can see what is going on—Mercury will take until January 2, and his big brother Mars will take longer, until April 30. However, you will feel heightened energy after the retrograde is over, and the planet will get stronger and more useful to you with each passing day.</p>
<p>You may enjoy this slow period after the hustle and bustle of the holidays. As you think about it, a trip may sound very appealing. You still can be productive despite the lack of help from Mercury and Mars, so don’t be discouraged.</p>
<p>Romance will take a back seat this month to other matters. On Christmas Day (also Chanukah, which this year falls on December 25) the transiting moon will be in your opposite sign of Scorpio. Let your partner make some of the festive arrangements. Sit back, appreciative you won’t have attend to every detail as your partner gladly pitches in.</p>
<p>New Year’s Eve, however, could be quite exciting, for the transiting moon will be in Capricorn, a sign that dovetails with Taurus perfectly. If you are planning to ring in the New Year on foreign shores (possible), that could be amazingly romantic and memorable. At the new moon December 30 (influential for weeks and even months) Saturn will take the lead and be outstandingly supportive to this new moon. This is proof you can weave a memory with your partner, especially if you travel together, and it matters not if the trip is long or short.</p>
<p>What matters is that you spend time together under the stars.</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Just about everyone is out shopping in December, but this month brings some challenges because Mercury started to retrograde last month on November 25 and won’t go direct until December 15. Merchandise stock will be low, and deliveries impeded by heavy storms and labor strikes are commonplace during Mercury retrograde periods. It will be imperative that you ship gifts in the first week of the month, no later. If you cannot find the ideal gift for someone you love, consider a gift card or an experiential gift, such as tickets to a concert, ballet, or play (but check with your recipient about the date you choose).</p>
<p>Mars will begin to retrograde too, from December 6 to February 23, and that indicates you are entering a time of planning (but do not act on major initiatives until Mars is fully regulated, April 30).</p>
<p>On another note, while almost everyone spends more money in December than in other months, you seem to be extra careful to track the spending on your credit card. As a Taurus, you are known to be wise about how you handle money, and surely this month you will prove this to be true. The new moon that appeared on the last day of last month, November 30 (or December 1, depending on your time zone), will be a big help to keeping track of your spending—it will give you the motivation to enter the New Year in good financial shape. Mars in Leo will be in your house of home and family, so you will certainly take good care of loved ones as you plan for a happy holiday for family and friends.</p>
<p>Your focus on money will culminate at the full moon December 15 in your earned income sector. Saturn will whisper to you, “conserve money” from his perch in your friendship sector, so you might decide which holiday festivities you will attend and which ones you’d rather pass on in order to keep your budget intact. You seem determined to pay for holiday spending in full when the bill arrives and not allow balances to lag and lapse into multiple months into the New Year if possible.</p>

        <p>Your career life is going well, for your ruler Venus is found at the top of your horoscope, conjunct Pluto. This indicates you are rapidly becoming a force of nature in your industry and how popular you are with VIPs. You will feel the pressure to attend to your responsibilities for home and family too, as Mars is directly opposed to Venus and Pluto, and keeping both career and home humming along will not be easy. You’ve had this aspect before, and you seem to have developed a way to juggle these two areas of your life, a skill that will come in handy in mid-month.</p>
<p>New Year’s Eve may be your favorite time of the month. The month’s new moon, December 30, will fall in Capricorn, a sign that blends divinely with your Taurus Sun. Capricorn is a sign aligned with tradition, so there is no need to think of doing something new and different, but rather to enjoy rituals you’ve known all your life and to revel in them now.</p>
<p>If travel interests you, that will happen at this glorious new moon December 30 in time to ring in the New Year on foreign shores. Spin your compass—Paris? Sicily? Tokyo? New York? Anywhere you go would be a joy. This new moon will perfectly heighten emotions, making New Year’s Eve one for the Taurus record books. You could easily build a memory that will stand the test of time.</p>
