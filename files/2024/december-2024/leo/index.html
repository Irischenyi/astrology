        <p>You have quite an enchanting month in store. The new moon on November 30 or December 1 (depending on your time zone) is in Sagittarius, 10 degrees, and it brilliantly illuminates your fifth house of true love. You’ve worked hard on your career recently, but now it’s time to push back from your desk, dress up, and go out to enjoy holiday parties.</p>
<p>Not invited to any lately? Keep checking your email, because it looks like those invitations will come, and they will be too exciting to pass up. While you wait, think about giving a party of your own. Of all the signs, Leo certainly knows how to host stylish events, and you set the bar high for the other zodiac signs to try to measure up to.</p>
<p>Not only is your ruler the Sun and the December 1 new moon glittering in your truelove sector, Jupiter is partnering with the Sun, this new moon from your eleventh house of friendships and hopes and wishes. These two lovely, social houses of your chart will light up brightly for you.</p>
<p>The only element in your chart that could put a crimp in your style is the fact that practical Saturn, the taskmaster, is positioned in your eighth house of credit cards and money matters—since March 2023, Saturn has been giving you a cosmic MBA in financial management. Because Saturn can be a tough teacher, you may be hesitant to spend on social events, so if you do participate, you will have to do so wisely.</p>

        <p>As a Leo, you’re not fond of the word “budget,” and while you tend to spend lavishly, your chart suggests that you have new, important priorities for your money. If you do go to any parties, or give one, you will want to set up financial perimeters to stay within—you might bristle at the very thought of having to exercise restraint, but it will all be worth it if you come closer to reaching a goal. You have about 15 months left of Saturn’s tutoring. After February 2026, you will be free of him for a very long time as Saturn moves to another, gentler part of your chart.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Mars is in Leo, and he will help you by beaming very positive rays to the Sun and the December 1 new moon. There are ways to give a party or go to one or more of them without breaking your piggy bank. You can search the Internet for ideas about how to save when entertaining, and you will find some interesting tips.</p>
<p>If your birthday falls on August 1, plus or minus five days, all I have said about the new moon of December 1 will resonate with you strongly. The same is true if you have Leo rising at 10 degrees or your natal moon is in Leo at 10 degrees (plus or minus five degrees in both cases). Also, look at your chart and see if you have any planets in Leo, Aries, Sagittarius, Gemini, Libra, or Aquarius at 10 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. If you do have such a planet, that planet will work very hard for you—jot down some quick notes about what happens. That’s the best way to gradually see how astrology works.</p>
<blockquote><p>The message of December is to have fun, enjoy romance, and be grateful for the blessings of the coming holidays.</p></blockquote>

        <p>At the full moon on December 15 you will encounter more social festivities. This full moon will crest in your eleventh house of friendships. It appears you’ll be attending an event populated by many smiling people sometime between December 13 and December 20. The moon will reach fullness somewhat near transiting Jupiter (the orb will be wide, within 9 degrees, so it will still be within the circle of significance). This suggests that any party you go to would be quite heavenly and almost dreamlike in its beauty.</p>
<p>I admit that Saturn will still be taunting you from your eighth financial house. Saturn will send a harsh “square” (a challenging aspect) to the Sun in Sagittarius and this full moon in Gemini. You will experience some pressure in the overall background of your life about money in general, so you will have to be wise in the ways you spend. Still, if you can attend a party, you would benefit from stepping away from your normal everyday cares for a few hours.</p>
<p>If your birthday falls on August 17, plus or minus four days, or if your natal moon is in Leo or you have Leo rising at 24 degrees, you will feel the December 15 full moon directly. Look to see if you have a planet in Leo, Aries, Sagittarius, Gemini, Libra, or Aquarius at 24 degrees, plus or minus five degrees—that planet will help you and work hard for you.</p>
<p>Mars will still be in a favorable position from his placement in Leo to support you in your quest to have fun. During this full moon Mars will reach out to Mercury, the natural ruler of your solar second house of personal income. At the start of the month you seem to be concerned about cash flow, but thanks to Mars, this full moon should help you find ways to bring in money.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, on the weekend of December 15 Venus in your marriage and established relationship sector will add to this lovely picture, so while this full moon should help singles to meet someone interesting, if you have already found your one truelove, that person will clearly show you that they truly love you and will express how deep their feelings for you are at this full moon.</p>
<p>Mars is currently in Leo but will soon go retrograde from December 6 to February 23, 2025, a period of a little over 11 weeks. Mars will start to slide backward in Leo, but on January 6, 2025, he will enter Cancer. You may change your mind more than once on a matter important to you. Having Mars in your own sign is quite a privilege because Mars will give you presence—people will notice you—and you will have some control over what’s happening. Mars only comes to each sign every two years and typically stays for six weeks, but you will be hampered by this retrograde since Mars will not be as strong as you would like.</p>
<p>Mars teaches us all how to compete in any arena and do it masterfully. With Mars retrograde, you still can succeed, but it will take more effort from you regarding time and money. It will be hard to convince anyone of anything. This means you will need patience when dealing with clients. As business associates or management try to make up their minds on simple proposals you present, they will take two steps forward and one step back. Don’t feel singled out, for everyone will be in the same boat in one way or another.</p>
<p>When Mars goes direct on February 23, 2025, these circumstances will improve, but Mars still won’t be in perfect shape—it will take until April 30, 2025, for Mars to be as strong as he was prior to this retrograde period.</p>

        <p>Don’t be blue if you are assuming you will have lost your time with a good, strong Mars this year or feel disappointed that you will have to wait two more years to have Mars back in your sign. Actually, Mars will go direct in Cancer, and as he gets stronger, the Red Planet will enter Leo again from April 17, 2025, to June 17, 2025. You will have your time in the Sun, dear Leo. That transit will be a far better period for you to announce big decisions and new ventures. In fact, that may be the most important stretch of all of 2025 for you.</p>
<p>I should mention that last month Mars’ little brother Mercury—better known as “Dennis the Menace”—started to retrograde on November 25 and will continue to move backward until December 15. To have both Mars and Mercury overlapping in retrograde during the same month could be frustrating at times in December, so it’s a good thing that you will devote most of your energy this month to love and that you won’t have to give your main focus to work.</p>
<p>No planet readjusts its orbit the moment it goes direct—in fact, a planet is at its worst at the start and end points of any retrograde (the reason it is not wise to rush to have papers signed the day before or after the retrograde). Leave a space of days—as many as you can muster.</p>
<p>After Mercury goes direct on December 15, things will improve, but Mercury will not be operating at full power again until January 2, 2025, and beyond.</p>
<p>Mars will go direct on February 23, 2025, and you will feel some relief. To work up to peak energy, Mars will need until April 30, 2025.</p>

        <p>All planets rest when they retrograde. (The Sun and moon do not retrograde, and they are not planets—the Sun is a star, and the moon is the Earth’s satellite.) The planets that orbit closest to Earth are the ones we feel the strongest when retrograde, and those are Mercury, Mars, and Venus, which astrologers call the “personal planets.” These planets make every day seem a little different, while the big, outer planets—Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto—affect entire generations because they move so slowly and are in one sign for years. They also affect you, only not as much when retrograde, not like the smaller personal planets. Jupiter is in the “Goldilocks,” medium, region, moving just enough to set a goal and see it materialize during his one-year visit.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed, this will give 2025 a slow start, but there is a plus side to all these retrograde periods. They will give us all time to reflect on past events, actions, and decisions. With the benefit of hindsight, you can see what went right, what went wrong, what you learned, and what you might need to tweak. We all like to continually move forward, but the universe advises us not to rush ahead so much all the time. Reflection is just as important as action.</p>
<p>Christmas Day and Chanukah will fall on the same day this year, December 25. The transiting moon will appear in the deeply spiritual, emotional, and privacy-seeking sign of Scorpio. Surround yourself with those who matter to you the most for a peaceful, rejuvenative holiday.</p>
<p>After this lyrical, romantic month, you will be ready to go back to work and dig in several days after the new moon of December 30 that appears in Capricorn, 10 degrees. This new moon will bring a flurry of assignments to focus on, so you won’t be bored. The most prominent planet will be Saturn, the planet that teaches us to feel pride in our accomplishments after working hard toward a goal. That wisdom will apply to you because Saturn in Pisces will be beautifully oriented to the Sun and new moon in Capricorn.</p>

        <p>In fact, the assignment you will be given at the end of December and work on in January and maybe February could add up to more money in your pocket when bonuses or fees are given out at the end of February. Do your best because Saturn can be a hard and demanding teacher, but he is fair and will bring rewards if you cooperate with him.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>The message of December is to have fun, enjoy romance, and be grateful for the blessings of the coming holidays. To get you started, a beautiful new moon will arrive on November 30 or December 1 (depending on your time zone) in Sagittarius, and it will fill your fifth house of true love, fun, social activity, and leisure. This same area of your chart, your solar fifth house, also rules pregnancy and the care of children, along with creative pursuits, so one or more of these topics may become important and exciting for you.</p>
<p>All month Mars will remain in Leo, a place this action planet entered last month on November 3, to stay until January 6, 2025, giving you a certain presence and charisma at any gathering. It is a privilege to have Mars in your sign because it only happens once every two years and generally for six weeks. This year is different in that Mars will go retrograde on December 6 until February 23, 2025.</p>
<p>Mars won’t be as strong as he usually is from December 6 to January 6, 2025, while in Leo. This will be a time of reflection and to gather information, but not for action. You may find you will change your mind more than once about certain actions you plan to take.</p>

        <p>Mars will orbit backward into Cancer on January 6, 2025. You won’t lose out because Mars will be back to Leo from April 17, 2025, to June 17, 2025. As you see, you will have plenty of time with Mars. This also means you will be in a very busy period while Mars is in Leo. You will have more control over events than usual, and you should be pleased with this trend. People around you will listen to your ideas and tend to approve them, not only in your career but also in your personal life.</p>
<p>One caveat: It is not wise to marry during Mars retrograde. Mars rules sex, so this area of life is likely to become lackluster soon in the relationship unless you work very hard to keep everything fresh.</p>
<p>The December 1 new moon in Sagittarius will affect you for weeks and as many as five months ahead. This new moon is right up your alley. If you are single, it will increase your chances of meeting a special someone who could have remarkably good chemistry with you. If you are attached, you will fully enjoy the holidays and concentrate on each other and your children too, of course. For those who hope for a pregnancy or to do something special for a child you have now, that will be possible with the right options surfacing. Meanwhile, your social life will pick up and generally put you in a bright, celebratory mood.</p>
<p>You have Saturn in hard angle to this new moon, so you will be mindful of financial obligations and the need to save for a larger goal. Saturn in your solar eighth house is teaching you that instant gratification will not bring the same pleasures of saving up for something bigger and more lasting that would positively impact your life, such as to buy property, go back to college, or start a business.</p>

        <p>The full moon of December 15 will be in compatible Gemini, and it will likely bring a luxurious experience—an invitation to a party with friends or dinner with your sweetheart or spouse at a special-occasion restaurant all decked out in festive holiday decorations. Jupiter will orbit close to this full moon, which is the reason you will love the events that happen at this time so much. Neptune, however, in a financial house will be at odds with this full moon, so you may not be aware of how much you are spending—keep an eye on your finances, and check your balances on your banking app often.</p>
<p>Mercury will be retrograde in compatible fellow fire-sign Sagittarius and your house of fun and love. You may be the only sign that will actually enjoy this phase of Mercury retrograde because Mercury will bring back many friends from your past. If you still hold a torch for a former love, that person may reappear, and both of you can decide whether you should try to make a go of your relationship again. There is no predestination in astrology—you get to choose.</p>
<p>The new moon of December 30 will gently bring your mind back to tasks at work and at home that need to be done. After a joyous New Year’s Eve celebration, you will have to get down to brass tacks, roll up your sleeves, and start working. You’ll be ready. After a glorious month full of fun and relaxation, you’ll be fine with returning your focus to all that’s important to accomplish.</p>
