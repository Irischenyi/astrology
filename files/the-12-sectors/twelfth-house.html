<h1>twelfth-house<h1>

	    	<p>The twelfth house rules the subconscious mind, dreams, intuition, instinct, and secrets. In fact, it dominates all that&#8217;s hidden, including activities going on behind the scenes and confidential engagements.</p>
<p>Psychotherapy and psychic phenomena both fall under this house as part of its rule over the subconscious mind. Dynamics acting on this house can heighten our hunches and intuition.</p>
<p>The ancients wrote that &#8220;self-undoing,&#8221; meaning anything we do to undermine ourselves, also comes under this house. It governs rest, reaching the end of long cycles &#8212; and the termination of any and all confinement, such as hospital stays, nursing home residences, or even jail sentences.</p>
<p>This is the house where we go to heal ourselves. It also rules self-sacrifice, inner suffering, limitations, and secret enemies. Lastly, this house rules charity, especially on a one-on-one basis.</p>
<p>A little known fact is that all large animals come under the domain of the twelfth house.</p>
<p>The twelfth house is ruled by spiritual and self-sacrificing <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-planets/neptune/">Neptune</a> and by compassionate <a href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-signs/pisces/">Pisces</a>.</p>
