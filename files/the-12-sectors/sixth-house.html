<h1>sixth-house<h1>

	    	<p>The state of the sixth house indicates your daily routine and the methods you use to get your work done. The cusp of this house describes the nature of your work and the general environment of your workplace. This house also rules people you employ, whether at home or at work.</p>
<p>This house rules the conscious mind and the proactive measures we take to keep our bodies healthy. (Remember, the first house of the horoscope rules health in terms of overall energy level and vitality, so both have to be considered.) Diet, fitness, and exercise are covered in this sixth house, as are checkups and visits to the dentist.</p>
<p>Finally, all domestic pets and small animals come under this house, too.</p>
<p>The sixth house is ruled by intellectual, news gathering <a class="small" href="/learn-astrology/the-planets/mercury/">Mercury</a> and by the meticulous and service-oriented sign, Virgo.</p>
