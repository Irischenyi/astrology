	    	<h3>The Houses: The Building Blocks of Your Life</h3>
<p>As each planet works its way through the twelve constellations (which make up the twelve signs of the zodiac), it passes through one of the twelve houses of each of those signs. Each house governs a different area of life, from relationships, marriage, and children, to your career, co-workers, study, travel, and the home &#8212; one of them even rules your identity and appearance.</p>
<p>At the moment of your birth, the planets were spread out in a specific formation, each one located in a specific house. This pattern made by the planets and their locations, called the &#8220;natal horoscope&#8221;, is nearly as individual to you as your fingerprint.</p>
<p>On your natal horoscope, some houses may have been full, and others empty. (There are eight planets plus the Sun and moon and, as I said, twelve houses, so there are not enough planets to go around.) It makes no difference if you have a few empty ones. Everyone does &#8212; at least an empty house doesn&#8217;t have any difficult planetary energy in it!<br />
Keep in mind that the planets continually move through these houses as they orbit the Sun. A house that is empty in your natal horoscope could be very full today!</p>
