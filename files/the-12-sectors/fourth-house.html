<h1>fourth-house<h1>

	    	<p>The fourth house covers your home &#8212; what it looks like, where it is located, and with whom you share your space. This includes any houseguests or visitors who stop by to visit or to help you with home-improvement projects or for babysitting. It also rules individuals who challenge domestic harmony.</p>
<p>Family life comes under this fourth house, as would all property matters such as the real estate &#8212; buying or selling houses, condos, co-operatives, or the leasing of an apartment. This house also rules your parents and your relationship with them, the foundations of your life. Finally, the fourth house indicates the lifestyle you will have much later in life, for the fourth house is a metaphor for the end of the day.</p>
<p>The fourth house is ruled by the sentimental sign of Cancer, and its nurturing <a class="small" href="/learn-astrology/the-planets/the-moon/">Moon</a>.</p>
