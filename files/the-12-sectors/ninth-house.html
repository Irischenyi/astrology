<h1>ninth-house<h1>

	    	<p>This is the house that encourages us to think big and bold, and to consider the future in the broadest terms. There always seems to be a certain amount of preparation required before one can take full advantage of all that the ninth house has to offer. Long distance travel, international communication, interactions and relationships with foreigners, distant relatives and in-laws, and higher education are the key areas covered by this important house.</p>
<p>It also rules your attitudes and viewpoints on all topics, and your efforts to understand complex issues, including morals and ethics. This house drives discussions on philosophy, religion, publishing, legal and academic matters. It emphasizes the higher mind and mental exploration.</p>
<p>The ninth house is ruled by fortunate <a href="/learn-astrology/the-planets/jupiter/">Jupiter</a> and by the philosophical and scholarly sign of Sagittarius.</p>
