<h1>seventh-house<h1>

	    	<p>The seventh house rules marriage, business partnerships and any serious contractual agreement between two people or entities.</p>
<p>This house holds both the possibility of completion of an agreement or of conflict. Your open enemies and detractors would be covered here, as would your staunchest allies.</p>
<p>This house also manages experts you hire: attorneys, agents or others who represent or collaborate with you.</p>
<p>For most people, the seventh house is most significant as an indication of the status of a marriage partner. This house describes what you need most from your significant other, and the rapport that develops between you.</p>
<p>Please note that romantic love is reflected in the fifth house, but once a commitment is made, that promise moves the relationship to the seventh house. The &#8220;contract&#8221; made between two people, or two entities, may be written or verbal.</p>
<p>The seventh house is ruled by gentle, refined <a class="small" href="https://www.astrologyzone.com/learn-astrology/the-planets/venus/">Venus</a> and by the partnering sign of Libra.</p>
